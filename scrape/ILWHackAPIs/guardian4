The app has been designed as a series of games and interactive tutorials teaching basic road safety as well as safer driving tips and first aid skills.</p><p></p><p>The app is part of a wider project – financed with $99,000 (£63,000) of seed funding from the Canadian government – which is attempting to tackle the spiralling death toll from motorbike accidents in Kenya.</p><p></p><p>The country already has one of the highest rates of road deaths, and traffic accidents are the <a href=\"http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/1370/wp545-281698.pdf\" title=\"\">third leading cause of premature death globally</a> (pdf), after malaria and HIV-Aids.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, motorcycle use in Kenya has grown exponentially since the government abolished import tax on  motorbikes. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), <a href=\"http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_traffic/countrywork/rs10_kenya_en.pdf\" title=\"\">there are more than 180,000 motorbikes on the country's roads</a> (pdf), with the numbers rising rapidly.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The move by the government to make motorbikes a more affordable mode of transport was designed to encourage their use on rural roads that are ill-suited to cars and buses, improving access to remote areas and reducing heavy congestion in urban centres.</p><p></p><p>But rising road deaths have been an unforeseen consequence of this strategy, says Pamela Muthuuri from El-Friezo, adding that the government omitted to include public safety campaigns or messages about helmet use and safe driving.</p><p></p><p>\"There has been a sudden increase of motorbikes on the roads, with many young men seeing this as an opportunity to start working as taxi drivers,\" she says. \"Few of them have passed a driving test and many have just been taught to ride by their friends so roads have become far more dangerous as a result.\"</p><p></p><p>She hopes the mobile phone app, along with other elements of the campaign, will help to bridge the gap.</p><p></p><p>\"In Kenya, we love our mobile phones,\" she says. \"This app is really a training manual and a set of simulated safety exercises, but it's being delivered through a series of games that drivers can play on their phones and against each other as they wait for customers.\"</p><p></p><p>Crucially, the app includes first aid exercises that are designed to supplement a training programme run in conjunction with the <a href=\"https://www.kenyaredcross.org/\" title=\"\">Kenyan Red Cross</a>, which will initially train 500 motorcyclists to provide emergency response first aid to accident victims.</p><p></p><p>\"In Kenya, we have no real emergency services for people injured in traffic accidents, which only increases the terrible death toll,\" says Muthuuri. \"Motorbike riders are often some of the first on the scene and can move through traffic quickly to get to an accident. If they know how to respond when they witness or hear about an accident, the life-saving potential is huge.\"</p><p></p><p>The idea is that those trained will then teach emergency skills to other drivers. The project will also offer training manuals, generate data on traffic patterns and accidents, and hopes to launch the first aid programme and mobile phone app in driving schools across the country.</p><p></p><p>The project will be launched this month in two cities in the Rift valley, working with 500 motorbike taxi drivers in each city. El-Friezo is partnering <a href=\"http://www.africa.airtel.com/wps/wcm/connect/africaairtel/kenya/\" title=\"\">Kenyan AirTel</a>, which will provide Android phones to participants to test the app.</p><p></p><p>\"Our hope is that this project will be rolled out on a national if not trans-African scale,\" says Muthuuri. \"We have to do something to stop these unnecessary deaths and the only way is with a cross-sector approach that uses technology alongside more traditional training and teaching methods if we want to get our message across to the right demographic.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/5/9/1368116344311/MDG--Road-safety-in-Kenya-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/may/13/kenya-mobile-app-motorbike-roads","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/may/13/kenya-mobile-app-motorbike-roads","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"We can end poverty, but the methods might surprise you | John Podesta and Casey Dunning","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-07T18:00:00Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2013/may/07/end-poverty-use-social-safety-nets","fields":{"body":"<p>\"Ending extreme poverty in all its forms\" is no longer a platitude or a dream for development experts – it's the guiding vision of the United Nations High Level Panel, as well as an achievement that's closer to being realized than ever before, thanks to the millennium development goals.<br /> <br />One of the best tools we have to this end might surprise you. Education matters, of course, as does higher employment and better health care. But for us, it's clear that the increased, global scope of social safety nets will make the most vulnerable of populations more resilient. We need these to end extreme poverty.<br /> <br />\"Social safety nets\" are programs designed to provide a floor of protection to the poor and to cushion them from shocks, and they help reduce overall poverty. These transfers can come from the state, donors, NGOs, or the private sector, and they run the gamut, including cash, food, and fee waivers for healthcare or schooling.<br /> <br />Social safety nets are cost-effective insurance against the risks that could derail many other developments around the world, in areas like health, education and food security. These protection programs help ensure that a family with some income doesn't fall back into extreme poverty when a husband unexpectedly falls ill, or when drought destroys two-thirds of the family's crops or harvest, or when food become otherwise unaffordable because of a sudden global spike in prices. Social safety nets guarantee that a family can continue to send their young daughter and son to school in spite of any economic, climate or health-related shock.<br /> <br />These programs come in many shapes and sizes and can be tailored to fit a country's context and needs: there are right models for Ghana, Mexico and Norway, though they might be very different. Some act as a general support system for those on the brink of poverty, while others target specific populations with more narrowly defined needs.<br /> <br />While they do require sometimes significant resources, these systems are not confined to countries on the middle and upper ends of the income scale. Rwanda has attributed a 12% decline in poverty since 2006, in large part to its Vision 2020 <a href=\"http://projects.dfid.gov.uk/project.aspx?Project=200292\">Umurenge Program</a> which prominently features public jobs programs and cash transfers. In 2011, The temporary boost to  Ethiopia's <a href=\"http://ethiopia.usaid.gov/programs/feed-future-initiative/projects/productive-safety-net-program-psnp\">Productive Safety Net Program</a> saved lives during severe drought and famine. Both Kenya and South Africa go so far as to include the right to social protection in their constitutions.<br /> <br />The benefits from these programs can accrue to the state as well as its citizens. Effective and targeted social safety nets can ease the transition away from inefficient, costly general subsidies. Many countries can reform fossil fuel subsidies, for instance, which often do not reach the most vulnerable populations and impose large fiscal burdens, and then turn toward more specialized social safety net programs, which can function as a  key component of medium- and long-term stability.<br /> <br />New technologies mean that states can craft their programs to help specifically the most vulnerable populations, and that they can do so efficiently. The widespread use of mobile phones, analytics and biometric technology lets a country implement social safety nets with far greater speed and efficacy than previously imagined. The government of India was able to enroll 200 million people in a national biometric ID effort in less than two years, modernizing a vital system that provides the poorest of the poor with food assistance, education vouchers and job opportunities.<br /> <br />Finally, beyond the moral argument, social safety nets make fiscal sense. The United States spent over $35bn on development investments last year to help the poor help themselves. It only makes sense to spend a fraction of this amount on a sustainable, systemic approach: better to provide a family with continued opportunity improve their conditions – through work and school – than to risk the collapse of whole neighborhoods and cities of families who could not rebound from dangers out of their control, like economic downturn and natural disasters.<br /> <br />The fight to end extreme poverty means ensuring that those who are lifted just over the brink – including the more than 600 million people who moved out of extreme poverty over the last decade – are resilient enough in their income, health and food security not to slide backward and take their families with them. Smart social safety nets can provide that security, guaranteeing that no matter how unpredictable the future, it won't undo  decades of development, upward mobility or the lives of countless people.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/14/1363282838909/tackling-poverty-social-e-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/07/end-poverty-use-social-safety-nets","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/may/07/end-poverty-use-social-safety-nets","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Live chat: can the poor bank on financial services?

Every year, many millions of people transition out of poverty ... At the same time, large numbers of people fall back into poverty due to health problems, financial setbacks, and other shocks. If available at critical moments, effective tools for savings, payment, credit, and insurance can help households capture an opportunity to climb out of poverty or weather a crisis without falling deeper into poverty.\"</p><p>With some <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTGLOBALFIN/Resources/8519638-1332259343991/world_bank3_Poster.pdf\" title=\"\">2.5 billion people</a> (pdf) who do not have a formal bank account at a financial institution (a group often referred to as 'the unbanked'), a plethora of services and initiatives have emerged, often as part of a wider private sector development strategy. Arguably the best known intervention is microfinance, <a href=\"http://www.microfinancegateway.org/p/site/m/template.rc/1.26.12263/\" title=\"\">defined</a> as both a means of lending small amounts while taking little or no collateral, and as a movement \"that envisions a world in which low-income households have permanent access to a range of high quality and affordable financial services\".  </p><p>But as Claire Provost <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/nov/21/rise-fall-microfinance\" title=\"\">writes</a> : \"A <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/R4D/PDF/Outputs/SystematicReviews/Microfinance2011Duvendackreport.pdf\">sweeping review of the evidence</a> concluded that the \"enthusiasm [for microcredit] is built on … foundations of sand\". Despite widespread support, it was unclear when, and for whom, microfinance had been \"of real, rather than imagined, benefit to poor people\", it said, suggesting political scientists should examine what had fuelled the excitement in the first place..\".</p><p>And microfinance is not the only financial inclusion tool that has to answer some tough questions. Despite the promise of mobile money, concerns are being raised about the safety of mobile banking systems.

What's at stake if hackers did break into the system is not just the individual acts of theft. It's the image of mobile banking — as a secure and reliable platform — that is at risk.\"</p><p>So how best to address the challenges in creating affordable financial services? What are the most effective and sustainable ways to provide the kind of access that can reduce income inequality and increase economic growth?

The systems we have built on that assumption are under increasing strain. Populations are ageing and costs rising. Health inequalities, whether measured across region or class in one country or across the globe, are stubbornly persistent.</p><h2><strong>Mobile healthcare</strong></h2><p>Relieving the strain will need new approaches, from health professionals, governments, brands and businesses – but technology could be the key enabler. Until now, medical technologies (more drugs, more tests) have generally increased costs. But information and communication technologies which offer more personal solutions might prove the exception. Paul Grundy, global director of healthcare transformation for IBM, predicts a profound change in how health solutions are going to be delivered. He talks of shifting medical practice away from \"an episode of care\" towards management of health across populations, made possible by \"the patient-centred medical home\". He doesn't mean a care home of the sort you visit when something's up; he means everyone in their own home.</p><p>This would include some version of the bathroom GP envisaged in a report published by<a href=\"http://www.forumforthefuture.org/blog/would-you-virtual-gp-your-bathroom\" title=\"\"> Which?</a>. Today's house may have bathroom scales linked wirelessly to a smartphone app. But come 2030, it could have sensors and micro-analysers which monitor stool and urine samples for indicators of liver and kidney function, glucose levels, and viruses. Anything out of the ordinary can also be relayed to the GP's surgery, without that tedious visit.</p><p>The basic technology for the tests already exists. Taking it to scale and linking the different elements together – at an affordable price – is probably only a matter of time. How they will fit into the complexities of healthcare systems is much harder to fathom.</p><h2><strong>The rise of chronic disease</strong></h2><p>Some of the trends forcing change come from our success in combating infectious diseases, changing patterns of illness. Rachel Maguire, who works on the future of hospitals at the <a href=\"http://www.iftf.org/home/\" title=\"\">Institute for the Future</a>, says more people now have a chronic disease, dealt with not by cure but through long-term management. \"With the burden shifting to account for an increased number of chronic conditions... our systems will need to be redesigned to provide almost constant, or at least consistent, care to treat such illnesses, including mental health conditions, more effectively\", she says.</p><p>Others wonder how well existing systems can promote such a shift. \"What's needed is radical transformation\", says Gemma Adams, a principal sustainability adviser at <a href=\"http://www.forumforthefuture.org/\" title=\"\">Forum for the Future</a>. \"Ultimately, we need a health service that avoids and reverses illnesses before they become serious, rather than focusing on urgent treatments. However, it's difficult to talk about this because the idea of anything but continuity and stability is alarming.  The impetus for this kind of change almost definitely won't come from inside health services such as the [UK's] NHS.\"</p><h2><strong>Harnessing technology</strong></h2><p>Some impetus comes from eager marketers trying to sell thousands of smart phone apps. In the pipeline are apps that monitor heart disease, and the likes of <a href=\"https://skinvision.com/\" title=\"\">Skin Vision</a>, which will upload a photo of a mole on your skin for automated analysis.</p><p>More generally, a host of mobile phone apps, with names such as <a href=\"http://www.lifewatch.com/\" title=\"\">LifeWatch</a> or Doc@home, offer to help people monitor their health or lifestyle or get access to medical advice.  At the moment, around a quarter of people with health care apps on their mobiles use them for chronic disease management and around the same proportion get health-related reminders on their phone or tablet.</p><p>Shiny gadgets will never be the whole answer. There is already evidence of the benefits that incorporating them into healthcare can bring to patients, and plans to build on this. The Department of Health, for one, wants to incorporate \"telehealth\" into the NHS. It ran a controlled trial of remote health aids from 2008 to 2011. Different aids were used in different places, but all were chosen to help patients already diagnosed with diabetes, heart failure or chronic lung disease. Results showed that the patients using devices at home to help monitor their condition had 20% fewer emergency admissions and, impressively, a 45% difference in mortality over 12 months, compared with the control group. The department has launched the <a href=\"http://3millionlives.co.uk/\" title=\"\">three million lives initiative</a> to bring such technologies to more people with long-term health conditions or care needs.</p><p>The UK trial did not demonstrate any major cost savings. However, other studies have shown reductions in cost. Analysis of a heart patients' programme in Boston – which adopted home monitoring of weight, heart rate, pulse and blood pressure, and transmitted the data daily to cardiac nurses – noted a 50% reduction in hospital readmissions for heart failure patients and savings of millions of dollars.</p><p>Good news for existing health systems, but mobile technology also shows promise in places where healthcare for most people falls far short of US or European standards – facilitating tasks such as collecting public health data, monitoring vaccination campaigns or reminding patients to take medication. One pioneer is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/childcount\" title=\"\">ChildCount+</a>, which uses phones to monitor pregnant mothers and young children in rural villages in Africa. It has been adapted to suit local goals, such as to prevent mother-child transmission of HIV in Kenya and Ghana: simple SMS reminders were sent to community health workers, who then passed on clinic appointment alerts to expectant mothers.</p><p>In countries which benefit from more developed health systems, flexible medical technology could lower costs. Will we see people pop into their pharmacy and come out with an app? Andrew Bonser of <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/\" title=\"\">Boots</a> does not rule it out. In future, he suggests a transfer of care away from hospitals towards the high street. \"Much of what you have to go to the doctor for now could be done in the community pharmacy\", he says. Boots has already launched a Type 2 diabetes risk assessment service with <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Diabetes UK</a>. Although this screening system uses an online tool, it is offered in the pharmacy, and illustrates how access can aid prevention.</p><h2><strong>Healthy cities</strong></h2><p>For Anthony Townsend of the <a href=\"http://www.iftf.org/home/\" title=\"\">Institute for the Future</a>, personal and environmental sensors are potentially a crucial part of a larger shift in urban planning, providing the data needed to ensure cities are healthier places to live and work. The city of Rio de Janeiro has presented its plans for integrated healthcare to the <a href=\"http://Living Labs Global Award\" title=\"\">Cities Pilot the Future</a> programme run by Living Labs Global Award, which aims to discover and implement the most promising solutions to pressing social and urban challenges. Rio has been working on data collection to become a \"smart city\" in preparation for the 2016 Olympic Games, and is looking for ways to enhance quality of life by integrating social support and health systems with mobility and other network services. Proposals include SMS-based information on alternatives to drugs, early detection of public-health risks, such as pollution hotspots, and remote mobile image-based diagnostics, such as teledermatology.</p><p>The ultimate goal – for megacities such as Rio and rural villages alike – is to integrate preventive health, treatment and care into daily life, relieving the strain on hospitals and clinics by enabling communities and individuals to keep a check on their wellbeing and take simple actions to improve it. When patients do need to see a doctor, the queue should be shorter, and they should have a lot more information about what ails them.<br /><em><br />• From a piece first published in <a href=\"http://www.forumforthefuture.org/greenfutures\">Green Futures Magazine</a></em></p><p><em>Jon Turney is a science writer, and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/nov/11/scienceofclimatechange-agriculture\" title=\"\"><em>The Rough Guide to the Future</em></a><em>. </em></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Slater, lead consultant, </strong><a href=\"http://www.fabriders.net\" title=\"\"><strong>Fabriders</strong></a><strong>, London, UK. @fabrider</strong></h2><p><strong>Don't overlook security</strong>: Many social justice activists (and the general public) are unaware of how vulnerable putting information online makes them, as is made clear by this piece by the <a href=\"https://ssd.eff.org/risk\" title=\"\">Electronic Frontier Foundation on risk management</a>. Addressing vulnerability also helps social justice groups keep up with digital security tools, which can often be an arms race.</p><p><strong>Harmful tools can be created out of good intentions</strong>: It is worth reflecting on tools that didn't work well due to lack of foresight. One example is an app that was created for refugees to help find family members displaced by war. The developers didn't think about how it would actually be used and cultural issues related to class, gender, nationality, tribe, language, religion and more made deployment very challenging. You can read more about it <a href=\"http://www.zerodivide.org/learning/blog/what_africa_nonprofit_dev_summit_taught_me_start_user\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p><h2><strong>Anne Roth, programme researcher and editor, </strong><a href=\"https://tacticaltech.org\" title=\"\"><strong>Tactical Technology Collective</strong></a><strong>, Berlin, Germany. @Anne_Roth</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Encryption can give false sense of security</strong>: Using a software without understanding what it does and what the limits are can be a huge problem. Let's say an NGO starts encrypting their contact databases to protect everyone they're working with. That's always a good thing to do. But if the password for the encrypted database is weak or transferred via unencrypted webmail in an open wifi this can be very dangerous. With the understanding that the database is encrypted there might be more information in it than if everyone was aware that it's not very safe to begin with. It's better to think first where digital security is needed most, to select the right tools and then to understand well how to use them.</p><p><strong>Minimise your digital shadows</strong>: As activists and advocates increasingly use digital media for important purposes, they leave traces online. <a href=\"https://tacticaltech.org\" title=\"\">Tactical Technology Collective</a> has created an interactive visualisation, <a href=\"https://myshadow.org/trace-my-shadow\" title=\"\">Trace my shadow</a>, that helps to understand which traces we leave and how we can to reduce them. You can also downloaded and print <a href=\"https://myshadow.org/me-and-my-shadow-flipcards\" title=\"\">flipcards</a> for awareness raising. .</p><h2><strong>Ben Taylor, former executive director, </strong><a href=\"http://blog.daraja.org\" title=\"\"><strong>Daraja</strong></a><strong>, London, UK. @mtega</strong></h2><p><strong>Remember context and purpose</strong>: This may seem obvious but it's often overlooked in ICT4D projects. To determine context, get to know the community you are working with. Make concerted efforts to understand its politics, its sociology and its economics, so your project can be truly useful.</p><p><strong>Don't put technology in the driving seat</strong>: ICT4D should always be geared to meet a particular social need. All too often, people get excited by a particular tool and try to apply it to everything. If you have a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail.</p><p><strong>Bridge digital divides</strong>: There's a real need to focus on the technologies that people are already familiar with. Even using SMS apps may be too much in some contexts, where literacy is a problem. If people in an area usually make voice calls, why not use voice calls to reach them?</p><h2><strong>Jennifer Radloff, project co-ordinator (capacity building in secure online communications), </strong><a href=\"http://www.apc.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Association for Progressive Communications</strong></a><strong>, Cape Town, South Africa. @jen_ct</strong></h2><p><strong>Build multi-stakeholder partnerships</strong>: Spaces like the <a href=\"http://www.intgovforum.org/\" title=\"\">Internet Governance Forum</a> play an important role in bringing stakeholders together. Partnerships can help alert technology companies to the realities of users, encourage governments to create policies to improve accessibility and show NGOs how technology actually works, how the internet works, and where the points of engagement are between development issues and technology.</p><h2><strong>Ronda Zelezny-Green, PhD student, </strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/10FU2CQ\" title=\"\"><strong>Royal Holloway, University of London</strong></a><strong>, London, UK. @GLaM_Leo</strong></h2><p><strong>ICTs have their limits</strong>: People who run ICT4D projects often fail to consider that the reliance on using only ICTs will prove problematic when a repressive government shuts down the communications infrastructure altogether.

ICT initiatives could help make qualitative data more quantitative.

As a totalitarian state, almost all media in Angola is controlled by the ruling party, and it is difficult to read, hear, or see dissenting opinions.

There's an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IDidNotReport\" title=\"\">initiative in India encouraging anonymous reporting</a>, where users send SMS messaging from cheap phones to a central number.

And it's an alarming picture.</p><p>The report covers two types of requests: </p><blockquote><p>• Government requests to remove content from Google<br />• Government requests from around the world to hand over user data</p></blockquote><p>This is how those numbers break down.</p><p>The latest report, which covers up to the end of last year, shows that in 2012 there were 21,389 inquiries from governments around the world. Those requests were for information about 33,634 accounts - these are users' accounts. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The number of government requests to remove content from Google's services was largely flat from 2009 to 2011. But the latest data shows that the huge spike witnessed in the first half of 2012 (when the number of government requests were up by 72%), continued in the 6 months that followed, albeit slightly slower (requests were up 26%). There were 2,285 requests from government officials around the world to remove 24,179 pieces of content.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>31% of governments claimed that their request was motivated by a belief that the content resulted in 'defamation', while 5% cited 'privacy and security'. A few controversial items on Google attracted a significant amount of government concern in the last half of 2012. For example, the movie \"Innocence of Muslims\" resulted in inquiries from 20 countries and removal requests from 17. The film was restricted in a further 8 countries and temporarily restricted in 2 due to 'difficult circumstances'. You can find out where it caused concern in the table below.</p><table>\n      <caption>\n            Innocence of Muslims\n          </caption>\n      <thead>\n        <tr><th class=\"left\">Request Type</th><th class=\"left\">Governments making request to Google</th></tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr><td class=\"left\">Remove </td><td class=\"left\">Bangladesh, Brazil, Brunei, Djibouti, India, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Maldives, Malaysia, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates </td></tr><tr><td class=\"left\">Query about community guidelines </td><td class=\"left\">Australia, Egypt, and the United States </td></tr><tr><td class=\"left\">Restricted </td><td class=\"left\">Indonesia, India, Jordan, Malaysia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Turkey </td></tr><tr><td class=\"left\">Temporarily Restricted </td><td class=\"left\">Egypt and Libya </td></tr>\n      </tbody>\n      <xml:group/>\n      </table><p>Although China's 'Great Firewall' attracts much attention, Google products have been inaccessible to the population of several countries. In Morocco Google Earth isn't available while in Turkey Google's blogger service isn't accessible. YouTube is not available in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran or Pakistan. Perhaps most worryingly, all Google products have been suspended in Syria since December 2012.</p><p>In the UK, content removals were up by 6% and included a request from what must be a local police force to \"remove a YouTube video that allegedly defamed them by artificially portraying a member of the agency in a racist uniform\" and another \"that was critical of police practices\". Google turned both requests down. </p><p>In another case, an MP requested that Google \"remove a blog post for suggesting that he advised businesses while serving in government\". The company did not feel that it was able to adjudicate on this and so, with the MPs consent, passed the complain to the blogger. The content subsequently disappeared though Google claims it did not remove it.</p><p>This is how UK requests look, largely dominated by YouTube. The biggest change can be seen in requests relating to Google AdWords, just 45 in the second half of 2012, down from 2,865. This was largely because of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/27/google-data-protection\">UK's Office of Fair Trading requesting the removal of 93,360 fraudulent Google Adwords linked to scams over the period</a>.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>In the US it looks a little different:</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Content removal requests were up by 18% in the US in July to December 2012 compared to the previous 6 months. Google received court orders from several different individuals. In some cases, a single court order resulted in a large response - for example they \"removed 771 items from Google Groups relating to a case of continuous defamation against a man and his family\" and \"removed 119 search results that linked to websites allegedly hosting trademark infringing material\".</p><p>The full data is below for you to download.

Digital signals are all around us. In developed markets, many of these digital exchanges involve electronic payments, but most people in developing countries are still stuck moving paper. Financial transactions lie at the heart of doing commerce, selling goods and services, managing a business, and taking care of one's family. Making these transactions safer, cheaper, and more convenient should be on the development agenda of every developing country. Yet building a digital payments fabric linking all citizens and businesses in a country is rarely a development priority, in part because the benefits are intangible and diverse. </p><p>To put a spotlight on the importance of effective retail payments, the first step is laying out a vision: we subscribe to the term inclusive cash-lite. Inclusive cash-lite is not necessarily a cashless world, but a world where cash is increasingly relegated to the 'edge' of the electronic grid, and used predominantly within local communities for small, face-to-face payments. In a cash-lite world, physical and digital money compete, each finding its own niche applications, with a gradual diminution in the role of physical cash over time. The logical transition toward a cash-lite world starts with people transporting less cash, then storing less cash, and finally using less (or no) cash in daily payments and transactions. </p><p><strong>Benefits of a cash-lite world</strong></p><p>Closing the digital payments divide between developed and developing countries and between rich and poor people may well become a cornerstone of the 21st century approach to economic growth and poverty reduction. Freedom from physical cash helps business innovation, increases people's control over their lives, and can support governments' efforts to fight crime and corruption by letting people and businesses transact more safely and cheaply across a much broader geography and across payment platforms. </p><p>Access to electronic payments can be a driver for business innovation. Bundling electronic payments information and software creates opportunities for businesses to streamline and automate processes relating to procurement, dispatch, inventory management, and payment collections. Being able to centrally initiate and control all payments electronically substantially reduces barriers to entrepreneurship by reducing the risk of fraud and theft to which entrepreneurs are exposed through interactions with employees, agents, and customers alike. Entrepreneurs might also have greater access to credit through credit scoring based on transactional histories.</p><p>Access to digital money can also increase people's control over their financial lives. The ability to make electronic payments instantly and conveniently may lead to more efficient risk sharing among family members and social networks. It opens up a range of formal financial services they can use for investment or risk management purposes. Electronic payments also bring a much higher level of privacy over financial matters, which may increase a household's incentives to accumulate more savings (with less social pressure to share it) and may help women to gain a greater degree of financial security and independence from the men that control their households.<br /> <br />Finally, the spread of digital money can also bolster the effectiveness of government and the rule of law by helping fight crime and corruption. The prevalence of cash is as much a problem for law enforcement as it is for financial inclusion: criminals can operate much more easily in a cash-based economy. Digitising transactions and making cash suspect is a good way of increasing costs for criminal operations as well as increasing the chances of their detection. And since government is generally the largest micropayer (of salaries, pensions, and social welfare payments, for example) and collector (taxes) in each country, it stands to gain substantially from a cheap, transparent electronic payment platform with adequate traceability of payments. </p><p><strong>The way forward</strong></p><p>Achieving an inclusive cash-lite world may take time, but it need not take forever. By clarifying the objective and by creating a roadmap to get there, we can ease the concerns associated with departing from cash and smooth the path forward. When financial sector policy makers show clarity of vision and purpose in this area, inertia and the clutter of vested interests can be overcome. </p><p>Moving from cash to digital money has been an inexorable if slow trend in developed countries, but it has been hampered in developing countries by the lack of penetration of banking institutions, by regulatory rigidities, and by the paucity and high cost of communications networks. An estimated 70% of the population in developing countries is untouched by the formal financial system. In many regions of the developing world, the gap in access to finance is starker than the gap in access to primary health, education, and clean water.</p><p>With the spread of mobile networks, we can now address these issues and transform the financial opportunities faced by businesses and households in developing countries. The commercial success of Safaricom's M-Pesa mobile payment service in Kenya, which penetrated into the majority of the adult population in just three to four years, has shown that there is pent-up demand for convenient electronic payments even among the poor. Yet the state of electronic payment systems in most developing countries is akin to the state of the electrical grid a century ago: fragmented, reaching only the wealthier third or so of society, and unreliable.</p><p>To harness the power of the grid in developing countries where typical balances and transactions are very small, we will need to think differently about payment regulation and business models. Despite the many obvious advantages of digital money, it has to be at least as good as cash in two key areas: convenience and trust. A sufficiently broad base of electronic devices is needed for people to operate and access information about their accounts, quickly and conveniently. Marketing must be fair and not misleading. People must feel fairly treated and have their privacy respected by the financial institutions that manage their accounts. And the regulatory and supervisory frameworks over financial institutions and their electronic platforms must give people confidence that their money is safe and their claims to it will be honored.</p><p>Most people who are new to such a system will want to maintain a foot in each payment world: the physical cash world they have learned to live with and the digital cash world that opens new opportunities to them. It will take time for people to become familiar with and entirely trusting of the new payment grid. Bridges will need to be built to create backward compatibility between these two monetary worlds, in the shape of a network of cash merchants willing and able to accept cash for electronic value and vice versa for a reasonable commission.</p><p>Building an inclusive cash-lite system requires both scale (to maximise network effects and minimise unit costs) and granularity (offering convenient services to/in every community). While the full vision may take a long time to realise, it will be important to get sufficient traction with customers early on to sustain the investments in marketing and technology roll-out required to achieve both scale and granularity. A range of players — banks, telecom companies, distributors, and regulators — will have to work together to create an interoperable digital payments grid.</p><p>This inclusive cash-lite vision is now within the grasp of many countries for the first time. When the history of development in the 21st century is written, it is likely to feature prominently those countries that have made the transition and gone cash-lite.</p><p><strong>By Ignacio Mas and David Porteous</strong></p><p><em>Ignacio Mas is consultant on mobile money and technology-enabled models for financial inclusion.

So people, instead of doing rote work, can do more creative work. More creative work requires more jobs, more fees, and so forth.  Agriculture is getting mechanised, which has been true for hundreds of years; people are moving to cities. Cities are more productive than rural farming anyway; they are more connected. </p><p>Creativity will drive innovation, innovation will drive new businesses, new jobs, and so forth. That's how economics works. That is the story of the British industrial revolution. If governments stay out of the way and allow this connectivity to occur, the core human creativity, this passion for making the world a better place, takes over. </p><h2>On privacy</h2><p>I'm concerned that we need to fight for our privacy or we'll lose it and the reason this is a concern of mine is that it's natural for these tools and technologies to aggregate information about citizens.</p><p>You take notes as a journalist. Where do those notes go? If the Chinese had just hacked into the New York Times and had gone through their internal servers, how would you feel if you were a Chinese dissident? You'd be worried. So these are some of the problems that happen when everyone is connected.</p><h2>On anonymity</h2><p>Google will always allow for anonymous search. If you choose to be logged in and let us record more information about you, we can provide better service for you, but you don't have to. Anonymity is very important, especially for people who have reasons to believe that the state, or others, are going to hurt them. The internet, in general, has been pretty good about allowing for anonymity. </p><h2>On <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/23/close-of-google-reader-googles-dark-side/\">closing Google Reader</a></h2><p>I do love Google Reader. All I can tell you is that there are very good choices on alternative readers and we needed those people to work on other, much more integrated products. It's always about priorities.</p><p>The thinking that Larry [Page], Sergey [Brin] and I had was that it was time to stop throwing things over the fence and seeing what happened, but have a much more sophisticated understanding of the global impact of our problems and products.</p><p>The term that we use internally is spring cleaning and Google Reader is an example of spring cleaning.</p><h2>On Julian Assange</h2><p>As a matter of historical interest, I wanted to understand what role Wikileaks would play. We met almost two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador-embassy-live\">well before the Embassy</a>, and all this kind of stuff.</p><p>He said a number of things which I thought were quite interesting. His core  idea is that systematic evil has to be written down and that, if you have a leaking culture in government, the government can't perpetuate mass evil because the stuff gets leaked before they can do it. That point makes sense to me. The problem is, who gets to decide who does the leaking? Well his answer was himself, and I was never able to determine any providence, god, religion, or so forth, that had appointed Julian Assange to be the person to make that decision. </p><h2>On the future of media and mobile</h2><p>Mobile ads should ultimately be more valuable because we have more information about the consumer, because we're connected to them. We know, roughly, their location. If they choose to, they can share their history with us. They can also target the areas in which they want advertising.</p><p>Five years from now, what will your average reader look like? He or she will have an ultra-powerful tablet, and a subscription on that tablet. The knowledge that's in that tablet about the readers and the things they care about will be so much greater than the newspaper of today. And it will be possible, reading a story, to go instantly deep about the origins, the history, the positioning, the debate. The evidence is that newspapers will thrive in this new model. Some will have subscriptions, sponsorships and some will have a free model.</p><h2>On the Arab Spring</h2><p>Many Americans wandered around saying somehow \"we caused this\" and that's clearly false. Having now visited these countries, they've had opposition movements for years, which were were brutally dealt with. For example, Gaddafi had a series of revolutionary groups in Benghazi which he literally roll-tanked and shot every three or four years. The contribution that the internet made was the enabling subset of communication that allowed courageous people to unify. That was the step that they had been missing previously and then it was their courage and real combat that led to everything else.</p><h2>On the future of nation states</h2><p>The nation states, at some basic level, are monopoly providers of services, they provide a unifying principle and ever since the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/peace_of_westphalia.htm\">Treaty of Westphalia </a>everybody's sort of figured out what nations were and what nations did. That's not going to change. What will happen, is that the countries will have physical policies and virtual policies and they may be different. For example, China and the US may be able to collaborate in physical space on commerce and yet clearly have conflict in cyberspace.  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/dec/12/china-us-hacking-tensions\">China is the source of many of the attacks on American firms</a>, for example.  So that duality - a strategy for cyberspace, a strategy for physical space - is possible.  </p><h2>On Google culture</h2><p>Since starting at Google we developed a simple rule which is that when somebody makes a claim, someone in the room checks it. When we were going public, a finance person got up and made a claim about an <a href=\"http://\">IPO</a> which didn't sound correct. So I checked it out, typed in the query, figured it out and now I've got the answer right in front of me. I'm the CEO, he's a CFO.  </p><p>Now I've got to make a decision. Do I embarrass him in front of his entire staff, or do I wait and embarrass him privately afterwards? Because it wasn't life critical, I let the meeting finish and then privately I showed him the information and then I said, \"You were wrong, go correct it.\"  </p><p>That's true within Google and should be true everywhere. Hopefully you'll do it in a nice way. I would welcome if I said something to you that was false during this interview if you said, \"Oh by the way, I just happened to be checking and what you said is not true.\" That's OK with me because I want to be truthful and you obviously want to be truthful as well. There are plenty of industries and places where that kind of behaviour is not how they behave.  </p><p>You know, we run Google from the basis of facts. And so usually the first answer out of Google is the correct answer, which is why it's fun to be associated with Google.  </p><h2>On open versus closed - who's winning?</h2><p>The technical optimists would say the following: the power of the internet and the power of individual empowerment is so strong that it will be impossible for governments to resist that connectivity. The pessimists would say that intelligent governments, which do exist, that have smart engineers that work for them can figure out ways of breaking the internet.  </p><p>Here's how they do it. The term we use in the book [<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/apr/20/eric-schmidt-cohen-book-extract\">The New Digital Age, by Schmidt and Jared Cohen</a>] is Balkanisation, meaning instead of having one global internet, having your own country internet. North Korea, I now understand, has its own internet. They have people copying the content that the respected leader thinks is OK and they put it on internal servers and they call that the internet. That's the crudest and least effective strategy, in my view.</p><p>Let me give you some examples of what governments could do. There is something called the DNS, which is the <a href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DNS.html\">Domain Name Service</a>, which is how you get to things, so <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/default.aspx\">Microsoft.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/\">guardian.co.uk</a>. If you go in and you programme that in a certain way, you can actually delete things. You can also, at the protocol level, lock ports, so you can block, for example, access to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a> in its entirety. So those have the property that it's not a flat open internet but rather it depends on which country you're in. </p><p>There are things called VPNs. The Chinese Government, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/may/13/china-cracks-down-on-vpn-use\">plays a game we call whack-a-mole</a>, where every time a VPN shows up, they shut it down and people move. Using modern encryption there are ways of getting even more sophisticated versions of this kind of thing working. The problem is that if you put these restrictions in place, the elites will figure out a way to get around it, but the average person won't, because they don't have time, or knowledge, or education, so there's a real loss of information. </p><h2>On education</h2><p>What's the number one education problem in the developing world? Literacy and childhood education. Can we solve that? Absolutely, at a 100% level. We simply preload phones with all that teaching material. You do it in their local language and, because people are going to be using their phones, they might as well use them to learn how to read. That's easy.</p><p>What's the next problem? The developing world don't have textbooks. So what's another solution? Preload their tablets. We have the textbooks for maths and science, in their languages. </p><p>So now let's talk about college. Well in college you've got new online courses, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/08/mooc-coursera-higher-education-investment\">they're called MOOCs</a>, and the anecdotal evidence is that 90% of the viewers are not from the US, and the majority are not from the developed world. That tells me that if you go to Rwanda, Kenya, so forth, you've got an incredibly smart person who does not have textbooks and is hungry for the latest college and graduate school level education, they're going to get it online. </p><p>So what do you need for that? You need bandwidth. If you're in a city in those countries you're going to get that education. If you're in a rural area, you may not, unless those governments are smart enough to get the 3G/4G networks out to the rural areas. </p><p>In South Sudan we asked, \"How do you get information to the people who are in north Sudan, or the Sudan people the government is busy hurting?\" The simplest way to get them information is to smuggle <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/sep/16/guardian-android-app-faqs\">SD cards</a> in - you know, the tiny little SD cards, because everybody has a phone.  </p><p>They turn out to be incredibly cheap, incredibly standardised, and it's a great way to get information about what's really going on in the world to closed societies. Even if you don't have an internet connection, or your internet connection is too expensive, you could have an SD card which would have the information that I'm describing. And these SD cards are getting more and more powerful.  </p><p>People in the developing world are much more clever than we think because they have to work with what they're given. So they'll find a way to solve their information problem with the tools at hand, and this SD card is an example.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/10/1365601570258/Eric-Schmidt-portrait-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/20/eric-schmidt-google","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2013/apr/20/eric-schmidt-google","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"How does the London Marathon compare to other races worldwide?","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-19T12:05:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2013/apr/19/london-marathon-compare-races-worldwide","fields":{"body":"<p>This Sunday tens of thousands of people will attempt to complete the 2013  London Marathon, undoubtedly the UK's most famous running race. But with a total of 37,000 runners, the London Marathon is only the fifth biggest 26.2-mile race in the world. </p><p>The biggest by far is in New York, where a world record was set when 46,759 people completed the New York City Marathon in 2011. Last year's race was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/02/new-york-cancels-marathon-sandy\">cancelled in the wake of Hurricane Sandy</a> despite Governor Michael Bloomberg's initial controversial claims that it would go ahead.</p><p>The London Marathon seems even smaller when looking at the number of people taking part compared to the capital's population. Just under five runners take part for every thousand London resident. </p><p>Factoring in Ibusuki's population size of 15,785, the Ibusuki Nanohana Marathon in Japan is far and ahead the biggest in the world - 410 people take part for every thousand resident of Ibusuki. The 18,000-runner marathon, which began in 1984, was originally called the Ibusuki Onsen Marathon after the famous hot springs in the east of the town. </p><p>To get our population sizes we used the urban area measurement of each city.

Africa can solve its food crisis by growing more crops sustainably | Camilla Toulmin","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-18T15:41:09Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2013/apr/18/africa-food-crisis-growing-crops-sustainably","fields":{"body":"<p>This week <a href=\"http://www.eu2013.ie/events/event-items/hncj/\" title=\"\">in Dublin</a>, world leaders, policymakers and civil society representatives met to discuss the urgent and interrelated issues of hunger, nutrition and climate justice that are faced by the poorest people and nations. In parallel, the global community is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/interactive/2013/mar/26/future-of-development-timeline\" title=\"\">already discussing</a> the goals and metrics that should shape sustainable development once the millennium development goals expire in 2015.</p><p></p><p>It is time to place sustainable intensification at the heart of African agriculture, and ensure that development goals deliver on the agenda opened in Dublin. Sustainable intensification involves producing more crops, better nutrition and higher rural incomes from the same set of inputs – such as land, water, credit and knowledge – while reducing environmental impacts on a sustained basis.</p><p></p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa faces specific and complex challenges. The number of hungry people in the continent <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/161819/\" title=\"\">rose to 239 million last year</a> and <a href=\"http://www.childinfo.org/malnutrition_status.html\" title=\"\">40% of children under five years old are stunted</a> due to malnutrition. Africa's population is expected to almost double by 2050, bringing it to almost 2 billion people. Based on present trends, the current African food production system would be able to <a href=\"http://www.globalharvestinitiative.org/index.php/media-resources/press-releases/2012-gap-report-press-release/\" title=\"\">meet only 13% of the continent's needs by 2050</a>.</p><p></p><p>Despite this urgent need, African crop yields have been largely stagnant over the past 50 years. <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y6831e/y6831e-03.htm\" title=\"\">Less than 4%</a> of farmland in sub-Saharan Africa is irrigated. <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/nyas_building_agra.pdf\" title=\"\">Almost three-quarters of its soils are degraded</a> (pdf) due to years of planting crops without replacing nutrients; fertiliser use is by far the lowest in the world with most farmers unable to afford it.</p><p></p><p>Yet the carbon footprint of African smallholder farming is low, and problems of <a href=\"http://toxics.usgs.gov/definitions/eutrophication.html\" title=\"\">eutrophication</a> and other forms of agricultural pollution are <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/fertilized-world/charles-text\" title=\"\">less prevalent</a> than elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>Sustainable intensification is sometimes viewed as a Trojan horse for the implantation of large-scale, industrial agriculture – increasing yields through a dramatic increase in the use of fertilisers and pesticides while paying lip service to the environment and local farming conditions. As such, sustainable intensification <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/gsbq-february-2012-agriculture-table\" title=\"\">polarises opinion</a>.</p><p></p><p>But the term needs to be <a href=\"http://www.fcrn.org.uk/fcrn/publications/sustainable-intensification-agriculture\" title=\"\">understood in a more balanced way</a> and reinterpreted as relevant to the realities of smallholder agriculture and the need for strengthening food security.</p><p></p><p>A <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/africanagriculturaldevelopment/themontpellierpanel/themontpellierpanelreport2013\" title=\"\">report</a> released on Thursday by the <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/africanagriculturaldevelopment/themontpellierpanel\" title=\"\">Montpellier panel</a> – international experts in agriculture, sustainable development, trade, policy and development from Africa and Europe – aims to demystify sustainable intensification and show its relevance to addressing food insecurity, malnutrition and poverty.</p><p></p><p>Agricultural intensification can take many forms, including current systems, many of which are not sustainable. With increasing pressure on natural resources and the impact of climate change, intensification must be made more sustainable. It can follow many paths, such as reducing reliance on fertilisers and pesticides; generating lower greenhouse gas emissions, and contributing to the maintenance of critical public goods, such as biodiversity and clean water.</p><p></p><p>Sustainable intensification is achievable for African smallholder farmers, and builds on many of their traditional practices. It includes: \"micro-dosing\" by which smallholder farmers use the cap of a drinks bottle to measure out small amounts of fertilisers, boosting yields significantly while keeping costs down for farmers and reducing the risk of fertiliser runoff into waterways; combining mixed field and tree crops, such as nitrogen-fixing varieties; harvesting and managing scarce water for supplementary irrigation; and promoting regeneration of diverse natural species in common lands.</p><p></p><p>But sustainable intensification requires more than just inputs and technology – it demands greater co-operation and organisation in rural areas. For instance, supporting village \"grain banks\" run by local farmer associations helps smallholders to protect their grain. Farmers deposit grain and the bank keeps it protected against pests and diseases, so that farmers can access it as needed or sell later in the season when prices are typically higher. This type of network is supported by the Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange, a private-sector firm that provides farmers with prices and other market intelligence by SMS text.</p><p></p><p>We are calling on governments, in partnership with the private sector and NGOs, to recognise the huge potential for sustainable intensification as a driver of development – in terms of food security, better nutrition and more resilient rural livelihoods.</p><p></p><p>While many parts of the world have experienced large increases in crop yields over the past 50 years, production has not always been intensified sustainably. Intensification is often associated with the ills of modern agriculture seen in the west – over-use of chemicals and fertiliser, pollution of rivers and water bodies, monocrops and biodiversity deserts.</p><p></p><p>But African agriculture does not need to follow suit. Helping African farmers to increase their production and incomes while safeguarding the environment – in short, sustainable intensification – offers a balanced and practical way forward.</p><p></p><p>• <em>Camilla Toulmin is deputy chair of the Montpellier panel and director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\"><em>International Institute for Environment and Development</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/4/18/1366298784040/MDG--Food-in-Africa--toma-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/apr/18/africa-food-crisis-growing-crops-sustainably","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/apr/18/africa-food-crisis-growing-crops-sustainably","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Grassroot-level innovations may hold the key to global challenges   ","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-17T11:03:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/apr/17/grassroots-innovation-solutions","fields":{"body":"<p>Low tech, grassroot-level innovations may hold the key to overcoming some of the resource challenges we face today; and we might be missing them. The solutions below are some exceptional examples of grassroots level innovations. The question is – how many other potential world changing solutions have remained in obscurity at source, never replicating sufficiently to make a significant change?</p><p><strong>Combating climate change, water and food security in arid regions</strong></p><p>A single farmer in Burkina Faso started an <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/regreening-africa\" title=\"\">agricultural revolution in the semi-desert area where he lives</a>, which has spread to other parts of Burkina Faso and into neighbouring countries. The 'tree farming' approach he championed (by personally travelling to around 100 other villages by motorbike) has re-greened millions of acres in the dry Sahel region; enough so that the effects can be seen from outer space. The innovation: pits which were dug to concentrate rainfall onto crop roots were made larger, and manure was added to them during the dry season. Tree seeds in the manure sprouted with the crops and these tree saplings increased soil fertility, shielded crops from overwhelming heat, and acted as windbreaks. At the macro level, areas with trees are more efficient for water harvesting than areas without. Water tables in the areas with tree farming have risen since the method gained popularity, despite a growing population.</p><p><strong>System of rice intensification: increasing crop yields while reducing water demand and chemical usage. </strong></p><p>In a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/feb/16/india-rice-farmers-revolution\" title=\"\">recent article</a>, another agricultural approach was explored in depth: the system of rice intensification (SRI). Through applying zero cost techniques to rice farming, small scale rice farmers have increased their crop yields by anywhere from 30-50% while reducing water and chemical usage. What must be noted is that this solution has been <a href=\"http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/origin/index.html\" title=\"\">around for 30 years</a>. SRI is credited to Henri de Laulanie, who came across the methodology while working with farmers in Madagascar in 1983. He set up an NGO to promote SRI. It was taken up by Norman Uphoff at the Cornell Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/17/science/17rice.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;\" title=\"\">advocated for post 1998</a>, and soon other countries started adopting the method.  SRI is now estimated to be used by 4-5 million farmers worldwide.</p><p>These examples are a small sample of grassroots solutions. Consider the idea of using a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0C-lSvbLT4\" title=\"\">plastic water bottle as a light bulb</a> in slums without power as another inspirational example of bottom up innovation. The question then, is how to ensure that these solutions are discovered and disseminated, rather than remaining localised in the areas they are conceived. Fortunately, there are both private and charitable organisations actively improving the chances of ideas spreading.</p><p><strong>Approach 1: the charity model </strong></p><p>Working with media partners in poverty stricken countries, <a href=\"http://www.sawaworld.org/\" title=\"\">Sawa World</a> trains unemployed or vulnerable youth to be reporters in their communities. This training provides the youth with a living wage, and reporters are tasked with reporting on solutions to poverty found within their own communities. These solutions are then shared through media channels such as radio or TV. In 2012, Sawa youths produced 94 videos on local solutions to extreme poverty. The organisation also provides 'Sawa leaders' (solution innovators), with support to communicate their solutions further afield, leading to far better exposure of effective innovations. In the past five years, Sawa World has supported 30 Sawa leaders in 11 of the world's poorest countries.</p><p>The clear focus of the model is appreciated. Their objectives and methods to effect change are unambiguous; but with a model that still relies on funding and charitable donations, the question remains as to whether Sawa World is, itself, scalable.</p><p><strong>Approach 2: the commercial model </strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/\" title=\"\">GSMA</a> is an operator led trade association which represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide. Through the  GSMA development fund, GSMA has been involved in projects bringing ICT and communications to multiple unconnected communities. A <a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/publicpolicy/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gsma-deloitte-impact-mobile-telephony-economic-growth.pdf\" title=\"\">study GSMA commissioned with Deloitte</a> estimates that an increase of 10% in mobile penetration will increase the GDP growth rate in developing nations by up to 1.2%.</p><p>In the <a href=\"http://serving.webgen.gsm.org/5926DA9A-2DD6-48E7-BAD4-50D4CD3AF30A/assets/gsmacasestudymillenniumvillage-1.pdf\" title=\"\">millennium village case study</a> in Mayange, Rwanda, Ericsson president in sub-Saharan Africa Jan Embro says:</p><p>\"The integration of information and communications technology plays a critical role in ending the cycle of poverty, helping people share information and giving them the tools to improve their own social and economic situations.\"</p><p>The project focused on enabling entrepreneurs in the Mayange community to deliver communication and data services through community phones and computers. Entrepreneurs charge a fee to access the equipment, and in turn pay a co-operative to lease their equipment and lines. The entrepreneurs involved in the project increased their incomes by 20-22% while bringing greater connectivity to their communities.</p><p>While the GSMA model lacks the more direct focus of Sawa World on poverty solutions, it is assumed that connecting communities will allow for better dissemination of innovations. In another project with GSMA involvement, <a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mkilimocasestudyfinal-1.pdf\" title=\"\">M-Kilimo</a> in Kenya advised rural farmers on best practices through a phone-in service. This is one of many possible uses of mobile connectivity. GSMA focuses on the commercial sustainability of their projects, allowing projects to scale more easily than in a donation-based model.</p><p><strong>The middle road: a role for social enterprise</strong></p><p>Both of the above approaches have their advantages and limitations. But there may be a middle road: a social enterprise with a commercially viable business model that focuses directly on propagating effective solutions at grassroot level.</p><p><em>Agustina Memoli, Paulina Polak, and Duncan Garde are 2012 </em><a href=\"http://www.onpurpose.uk.com\" title=\"\"><em>On Purpose</em></a><em> associates.

However, the degree of freedom afforded to social entrepreneurs is second to none. They don't have to operate within complex, established networks, win over colleagues or take risks that – even if successful – might not generate extra revenue for the business.</p><p>Conversely, to operate as a social entrepreneur within an established profit-making organisation often requires getting management to treat you, and your definition of success, differently. Not only that but the job descriptions for the roles many of these people want simply don't exist: you have to create your own job. Again, it's not easy and it takes a degree of chutzpah bordering on the disruptive. Not for nothing are such people sometimes better referred to as troublemakers. But I prefer to call them \"changemakers\" – these are social intrapreneurs.</p><p>In my own case, I run an organisation called <a href=\"http://www.accenture.com/us-en/consulting/international-development/Pages/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Accenture Development Partnerships</a>, which I set up 10 years ago to bring Accenture's services within the reach of NGOs and partners in developing countries. Staff take a salary reduction, we're not-for-profit but we're not-for-loss. But this is not CSR. Not a big deal you might think? Hardly revolutionary?</p><p>But you'd be missing the point. I believe that small changes can set off chain reactions, especially when large organisations with a lot of influence are concerned. Last week, at the inaugural <a href=\"http://www.leagueofintrapreneurs.com/\" title=\"\">League of Intrapreneurs Awards</a> hosted by <a href=\"http://www.changemakers.com/intrapreneurs/entries/empowering-innovation-culture-shell-using-meditation?breadcrumb_type=finalists\" title=\"\">Ashoka Changemakers</a> to mark the announcement of the winners, we heard that these small changes are heralding a quiet revolution.</p><p>Take Graham Simpson, from <a href=\"http://www.gsk.com/\" title=\"\">GSK</a>, as an example of <a href=\"http://www.changemakers.com/intrapreneurs/entries/empowering-innovation-culture-shell-using-meditation?breadcrumb_type=finalists\" title=\"\">last week's winners</a>. Simpson has a PhD in chemistry and is an extremely busy research scientist. But while on a six-month placement in Kenya he was struck by how many people there die from easily treatable diseases mainly through the lack of effective diagnosis. So he got in touch with the head of research and development at GSK and pitched the idea of developing cheap, yet commercial, diagnostics kits that could be used by often untrained health workers in rural villages, sometimes miles from hospitals. GSK is now working with John Hopkins University to develop the kits.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sacha Carina van Ginhoven is interested in how satellite technology might solve a problem she came across when talking to a friend who was living in a slum in Kibera, India. Millions of small businesses exist in slums worldwide but few have formal addresses, making it difficult to send and receive goods. So Van Ginhoven and her colleagues from <a href=\"http://www.tnt.com/express/en_gb/site/home.html\" title=\"\">TNT Express</a> collaborated with slum residents to study existing supply chains. Results showed that the main challenges lay in recognising locations and enabling secure payments. But these could be overcome by targeting mobile phones.</p><p>These two examples share some aspects: firstly, many of the people involved had the specialist knowledge to identify the solution to a problem that had been brought home to them personally. The second was that many of them had \"air-cover\" in the shape of senior management in their respective organisations. This is something that <a href=\"http://www.som.cranfield.ac.uk/som/p1436/People/Faculty/Academic-Faculty-Listing-A-Z/Last-Name-G/DavidnbspGraysonnbsp\" title=\"\">Professor David Grayson, at the Doughty Centre at Canfield University</a>, calls the \"godfather\" effect.</p><p>Ideas do not necessarily have to originate with chief executives but it is important to the success of a programme that senior leadership buys in from an early stage. It was particularly pleasing therefore that both Sir Richard Branson and GSK's Sir Andrew Witty sent personal messages of support to the finalists before the awards.</p><p>The last similarity, though, is perhaps the most obvious: sheer hard work. All the finalists admitted that, especially in the early stages, their intrapreneurship had to be squeezed in after hours or on weekends. There is probably little to be done about this.</p><p>Part of the point of intrapreneurship that it's not divorced from the intrapreneur's core job. Even so, with expertise, senior support and hard work there is no reason why this quiet revolution can't change the way we think about development and its catalysts.</p><p><em>Gib Bulloch is founder and executive director at Accenture Development Partnerships.

This what that data shows.</p><p>Although 26,839 people had registered to race, in the end, some 23,336 actually set off - this is normal for huge events like this. </p><p>The biggest group of competitors were aged 18 to 39 - 9,801 people, over half of whom were men. 181 of the competitors have some sort of disability - that's more than the number of people who competed from France and nearly as many as came from Mexico. It testifies to incredible determination: 54 racers were in wheelchairs, 40 were 'visually impaired'. </p><p>Fifteen of the racers were aged over 80.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>It was a United Nations of marathon running. Of all those who started the race, 18,816 were citizens of the US - which means nearly a fifth were from other countries. The biggest group, 40%, were from Canada - 1,831, followed by the UK, which saw 320 start the race, or 6% of all the non-US competitors. They are followed by Japan (238), Germany (224), Italy (202) and Mexico (192).</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Looking at where racers came from, you can see how the North East of the US dominates the map - even when it takes account, as the map below does, of population. This shows runners from each state per 100,000 of that state's population.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>So, for every 100,000 people who live in Massachusetts, there were 69 people competing in the Boston Marathon. In New Hampshire, the number was 27 - and in Vermont it was 14. But even Utah, which is not particularly close to Boston, saw 11 people competing for every 100,000 people who live there.</p><p>The data is below for you to download - what else does it tell us about

governance","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-16T12:51:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/apr/16/open-data-governance-jay-naidoo","fields":{"body":"<p>Having returned from speaking at a conference hosted by the World Bank president Jim Yong Kim on the issue of constituency feedback, I have re-learnt an important lesson: that citizens always know better than the government or the market what works for them. So why don't state officials and policymakers take us, the citizens, into their confidence? Can we begin to see citizens as the greatest ally for good governance? And if so, how do we pursue a partnership between government and citizens?</p><p>Part of the answer lies in open data. According to the latest open budget index survey, <a href=\"http://www.southafrica.info/about/democracy/budget-290113.htm#.UWGdPr8R6IY#ixzz2PnNEcbb3\" title=\"\">South Africa ranks second out of 100 countries</a> for the transparency and accountability of its budget processes. <a href=\"http://www.statssa.gov.za/\" title=\"\">Statistics SA</a> has the most comprehensive data sets in Africa. Imagine if we could take the education budget at R230bn (£16.6bn) for 2013/2014 and break that down into the budget per school. Parents, students, teachers would be empowered to demand to see the accounts of expenditure. If salaries have been set aside for 20 teachers but only 15 are actually there, then the school governing board and community would be the government's biggest allies in rooting out corruption. If textbooks are not delivered, toilets not built when money is set aside, then immediate feedback can be given to the authorities. We would be decentralising governance and ensuring that parents have the tools to demand action in the constitutional right of their children to quality education.</p><p>On a trip to Kenya recently, I spoke at the launch of the <a href=\"http://code4kenya.org/\" title=\"\">Code4Kenya</a> initiative backed by government, the African Media Initiative, media companies, NGOs and the ICT sector as one of the first sustained attempts in Africa focused on making open data relevant to and used by citizens.</p><p>Using exam and school location data, the NGO <a href=\"http://twaweza.org/\" title=\"\">Twaweza</a> has developed an education application '<a href=\"http://findmyschool.co.ke/discover\" title=\"\">Find My School</a>' that citizens can use to check relative performance of primary schools in the country. A fascinating portal provides parents with information on how individual schools in Kenya perform in national examinations. Quality education, accountability, teacher performance and accountability are visibly transformed in the interests of the students and the country.</p><p>Africa is the fastest growing mobile market in the world, with <a href=\"http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/africa-has-more-mobile-phone-users-than-the-us-or-eu/9053\" title=\"\">over 600 million users</a>. Using the pervasive mobile technology platform, we could avoid costly software applications and improve the performance of education.</p><p><strong>Best practice</strong></p><p>The transformative power of mobile technology in Kenya is well known. It is estimated that <a href=\"http://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2013/02/31-kenyas-gdp-spent-through-mobile-phones/61595/\" title=\"\">over 30% of the Kenyan GDP</a> is circulating on the back of mobile platforms like <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\" title=\"\">M-pesa</a>, putting effective financial services into the hands of the previously unbanked. Over 17 million customers can deposit, withdraw and transfer money, pay bills, buy airtime from a network of agents that includes airtime resellers and retail outlets.</p><p>Another example from Uganda is <a href=\"http://ureport.ug/\" title=\"\">U-report</a>, a free SMS service launched in 2011 with the support of Unicef, which gives young Ugandans a voice on issues they care about. The system has over 145,000 active U-reporters, and is growing through partnership with the government, NGOs, youth organisations, faith-based organisations and private companies. U-reporters join and answer an SMS poll or question on issues dealing with health, child protection, school, safe water, and more. Poll results are published in newspapers, reflected on radio, and placed directly into the hands of members of parliament. All text messages are free, a vital element in removing the barriers to participation.</p><p>There are lessons also to be learnt from the west. The New York City mayor's office, using the platform <a href=\"http://blog.allourideas.org/post/6326304438/making-new-york-greener-and-greater\" title=\"\">allourideas.org</a>, created an ideas marketplace, <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/home/home.shtml\" title=\"\">PlaNYC</a>, with 25 ideas (eg: open schoolyards across the city – to know how public wanted the city to look and feel by 2030. New Yorkers responded by casting about 25,000 votes and uploading more than 400 new ideas. Critically, eight of the top 10 ideas came from citizens. In other words, some of these ideas represented either completely novel ideas or new ways of framing existing ideas.</p><p>Technology is indeed changing the way we live, organise our lives, work, and play or even educate ourselves and access services from government or the marketplace. But technology is just a tool, an enabler on which we need to develop the applications that make our society more efficient and customer-orientated.</p><p>In discussion with <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/40146527\" title=\"\">Christopher Finch</a>, a senior social development specialist with the World Bank in Kenya, I learnt the following lessons:</p><p>• Citizen engagement is essential for effective development, strengthening the quality of policymaking and the science of service delivery with improved social accountability.</p><p>• The key stakeholders involved in citizen engagement are government, civil society, academics, the private sector, the tech community and other development specialists. They need to share information and experience in enhancing citizen feedback and participation for development.</p><p>• It is time to move from the rich experience and knowledge generated by the various stakeholders to concrete action on citizen engagement that leads to more effective development results.</p><p>• New models are needed to increase sustainability. Open data is not just government data — it can come from many sources. Several host organisations have begun to set up their own data desks, to convert and re-organise hard copy data into digital, downloadable formats that can inform and deepen their reporting and analysis.</p><p>• Translating data into action can be a complex process but partnerships with the media and 'info-mediaries' can help make open data benefit citizens. Their role is to analyse and turn data into visualisations and applications that citizens use and want. But ultimately, making open data work depends on culture change. And this takes time and a lot of work.</p><p>What we need is the political will to co-create the tools with citizens and civil society, and to harness the expertise and technology of the marketplace to deliver the services to which our citizens have a right.</p><p><em>Jay Naidoo is chair of the board of directors and chair of the partnership council of the </em><a href=\"http://www.gainhealth.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition</em></a><em>.

On Thursday the founder of Amyris Biotech <a href=\"http://www.amyris.com/News/290/Amyris-Scientists-Describe-Breakthrough-in-Development-of-Anti-Malarial-Drug-Precursor\" title=\"\">triumphantly announced</a> production of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rob_carlson/status/322036692838133760\" title=\"\">70m doses</a> of the anti-malarial compound artemisinin. This sounds like good news for poor people but may be a step backwards – the start of a new hi-tech assault on farmers.</p><p></p><p>There is no doubt that artemisinin is important. Artemisinin combination therapies are the World Health Organisation's drug of choice for battling malaria – which caused an estimated <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/index.html\" title=\"\">660,000 deaths</a> in 2010 – and other artemisinin-based approaches also exist.</p><p></p><p>Yet the good news stops there. Until this week, artemisinin for drugs was sourced entirely from the delicate leaves of artemesia annua (sweet wormwood) following sustained efforts to develop artemesia growing as doubly beneficial: a source of livelihood for African and Asian farmers, and a public health good. What makes Amyris's breakthrough significant is that its version has never been near a wormwood shrub. It comes from an industrial vat of bioengineered yeast.</p><p></p><p>Making this possible is a controversial technology called <a href=\"http://syntheticbiology.org/\" title=\"\">synthetic biology</a> (synbio). This artificially builds DNA strands in labs, using those strands to re-engineer microbes to behave as tiny factories. Ordinary yeast might ferment sugar into alcohol. Instead, this re-engineered yeast turns sugar into a precursor of artemisinin. This technical breakthrough, nine years in the making, was enabled by <a href=\"http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2013/04/11/launch-of-antimalarial-drug-a-triumph-for-uc-berkeley-synthetic-biology/\" title=\"\">$53.3m (£34.6m) from the Gates Foundation</a>. It is held up as the poster child for the brave new world of synbio.</p><p></p><p>Vat-grown artemisinin is highly attractive to large pharmaceutical companies such as <a href=\"http://en.sanofi.com/Images/32474_20130411_ARTEMISININE_en.pdf\" title=\"\">Sanofi Aventis</a> (pdf). They will now avoid the complexity of sourcing from thousands of farmers and <a href=\"http://www.a2s2.org/\" title=\"\">20,000 hectares (50,000 acres)</a> in Kenya, Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique, India, Vietnam and China. As for artemesia farmers, this announcement is an assault on their livelihoods.</p><p></p><p>Speaking at a <a href=\"http://e.wcs.org/site/PageNavigator/Cambridge.html\" title=\"\">conference in Cambridge</a> this week, the key synthetic biologist behind the project, Jay Keasling, said \"moves are afoot to replace the entire world supply\" of the compound. Asked whether this means that all natural artemesia production will be replaced, he said: \"Early on, it was not about replacing the agricultural form … and now I think it's nearly inevitable that it will shift over.\" Keasling proffered that artemesia farmers might switch to growing wheat and potatoes instead.</p><p></p><p>Keasling argues that putting artemesia growers out of business accompanies a laudable public health move: some growers sell to producers of questionable <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090714/full/460310b.html\" title=\"\">artemisinin monotherapies</a>, which in turn may give rise to artemisinin resistance. If a single source from a vat replaces the diverse botanical supply, it would be easy to control the market and eradicate monotherapies. Farmers are unfortunate collateral damaged.</p><p></p><p>Keasling's remarks are an astonishing late admission of what experts and civil society groups have feared all along. In 2007, the <a href=\"http://www.popline.org/node/181804\" title=\"\">Netherlands Tropical Institute warned</a> that just the prospect of synthesised artemisinin could destabilise prices and dissuade farmers from planting. Keasling and his partners rejected such concerns with assurances that there would be no discernible impact on farmers. Later, they argued that synbio production would only be used to <a href=\"http://www.testicare.com/comment.asp?Url=infectious-disease-malaria/malaria-areas-health-vaccine-anti-antibodies-million-would-year-tests.htm&amp;Content={C82AC287-EAE8-41A6-AF5B-9BBC4B37B2BC}\" title=\"\">\"supplement\" production</a> when botanical supply was flagging.</p><p></p><p>Now it turns out that artemesia farmers are dismissed as entirely expendable. The rejoinder of \"let them plant potatoes\" seems dismissive of farmer knowledge: farmers understand markets well and those now growing artemisia annua do so because it helps them bring in income. As for the argument that synbio is necessary to eradicate malaria, the botanical approach was already producing more than enough artemisinin to address malaria.</p><p></p><p>\"There is simply no rationale to have a synthetic product on the market when farmers could produce enough raw material to produce the tablets from pulverised high quality plants,\" said Professor Hans Herren, World Food Prize winner, who has worked extensively with east African artemesia farmers. \"Jay Keasling's words are denigrating for farmers – he should be ashamed of his work and words. It adds nothing to solve the malaria problem at all.\"</p><p></p><p>What may happen to artemesia farmers in Africa and Asia? History gives us some clues. After the introduction of synthetic chemistry in the 19th century, growers of natural dyestuffs in Bihar, Bangladesh, Mexico, Turkey and elsewhere saw collapsing markets, famine and deeper poverty.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, far from an isolated story, today's artemesinin threat is just an opening salvo in a <a href=\"http://www.etcgroup.org/content/pathways-disruption\" title=\"\">volley of potentially damaging market disruptions</a> involving synbio. Next year, synbio company Evolva will commercialise a version of vanilla produced by engineered yeast in a vat. Evolva believes it can legally and cheaply sell bioengineered vanilla as \"natural\" – competing with and undercutting the livelihoods of 200,000 vanilla farmers in Madagascar, Reunion, Comoros, Mexico and beyond. Allylix Inc has launched a yeast-grown fragrance compound usually extracted from vetiver – competing with 60,000 poor Haitian farmers. The same story is about to play out with patchouli farmers, rubber producers, coconut farmers and saffron growers.</p><p></p><p>Keasling says that with synbio, \"anything that can be made in a plant can now be made in a microbe\". For producers of natural plant products, that boast should send waves of alarm about this threat to tropical livelihoods. In the fight between people and microbes, bioengineered microbes may have just opened up a new economic line of attack.</p><p></p><p>• <em>Jim Thomas is research programme director for </em><a href=\"http://www.etcgroup.org/\" title=\"\"><em>ETC group</em></a><em>, a technology watchdog that works with farmers' organisations</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/4/12/1365779059068/MDG-A-farmer-harvests-swe-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/apr/12/synthetic-malaria-compound-artemisia-farmers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/apr/12/synthetic-malaria-compound-artemisia-farmers","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"How does Afghanistan compare to the world's other conflicts?

Data released today from <a href=\"http://aoav.org.uk/\">Action on Armed Violence</a> has catalogued 2,743 events with civilian casualties over the past year to find out. </p><p>78% of all 34,758 reported casualties were civilians. Since 2011, the number of killed and injured civilian casualties has increased by 26%. A large part of this growth is probably attributable to the conflict in Syria, which resulted in 8,382 reported civilian casualties last year. Syria was the most dangerous in the world for civilians - a drastic change since it was classed in seventh place in 2011. </p><p>The reported casualties represent 0.04% of the Syrian population, matched only by Gaza, as the most concentrated violence against civilians, although it's also likely that these numbers considerably underestimate reality (see the note on methodology below).</p><p>These numbers will be important as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/13/britain-arms-syrian-rebels-david-cameron\">British government deliberates</a> the strategic benefits of arming rebels in Syria. Syria is followed by Iraq (6,710 civilian casualties in 2012), Pakistan (3,287), Afghanistan (2,338) and Nigeria (1,017).</p><h2>Explosive findings</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.aoav.org.uk/uploads/changing_policy/The%20Impact%20of%20Explosive%20Weapons/AOAV,%20An%20Explosive%20Situation,%20Monitoring%20Explosive%20Violence%20in%202012.pdf\">Today's report</a> from the British NGO Action on Armed Violence focuses specifically on explosive weapons. The indiscriminate nature of these weapons has particularly disastrous humanitarian consequences as the report highlights. The report found a 45% increase worldwide in the number of child casualties and that in Syria 9 out of every 10 victims of an explosive weapon is a civilian. </p><p>Though landmines tend to receive more attention for their civilian impact, the report finds that mortar and shelling are far worse, having 90% of victims as civilians. </p><h2>Targeted areas</h2><p>The data shows that over half (61%) of all reported incidents of explosive weapons use occurred in populated areas. Unsurprisingly, these incidents resulted in higher numbers of civilian casualties (on average 16) compared to those in less populated areas (where the average was 7).</p><p>Markets, where 93% of casualties were civilian were the most dangerous places to be, since explosive weapons resulted in 25 civilian casualties on average. In places of worship, 94% of casualties were civilian and the average number of civilian victims per attack was 23. </p><h2>Methodology</h2><p>The NGO is very clear on the fact that their data does not capture every incident, or every resulting casualty, of explosive violence in 2012. They gather as much information as possible (information on date, time, location, circumstances, weapon type, reported used etc.) from Google News using an RSS feed which searches for key terms. </p><p>A total of 588 different sources were used to count civilian casualties in 2012. The five most used were The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, Xinua (the Chinese press agency) and CNN. Though there are limitations to this approach (like the bias of relying solely on English language news) it fill a gap in data. Though the United Nations sometimes publishes statistics on specific themes, such as <a href=\"http://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/\">children and armed conflict</a>, systematic data is hard to find. </p><p>There's a link to the full data below.

the words 'ICT4D', the popular acronym that describes information communication technologies for development, into any search engine and you may be forgiven for thinking you've stumbled upon the cure for all development ills. Projects are being run by the entire spectrum of development organisations, using every form of communication device (from radio through to mobile phones and satellite systems), to tackle the major challenges of our age: access to water, information, education, markets and many others.</p><p>ICTs are also being widely used to empower civil society and promote social justice. The near ubiquity of mobile phones means that every citizen has the power (if not always the means) to send or receive information directly via text message. The implications of this were summed up neatly in a <a href=\"http://fletcher.tufts.edu/Praxis/~/media/Fletcher/Microsites/praxis/xxvii/4BottYoungCrowdsourcing.pdf\" title=\"\">report published by Tufts University</a>:  \"Transparency breeds self-correcting behaviour among all types of actors, since neither governments nor businesses or individuals want to be caught doing something embarrassing or illegal.\"</p><p>But the transformation from citizen to 'witness' or even informant – through crowdsourcing or crowdmapping exercises – comes with challenges. These include the lack of adequate infrastructure in-country and the issue of understanding the local context. There is also the problem of \"<a href=\"http://appropriatingtechnology.org/?q=node/114\" title=\"\">drowning in too much information with too little effective use</a>,\" as ICT4D researcher, Tony Roberts puts it.</p><p>Increasingly important – yet often overlooked by NGOs – are the security risks associated with using ICTs to campaign, particularly in fragile or authoritarian states. The NGO <a href=\"https://securityinabox.org/en/welcome\" title=\"\">Tactical Technology Collective explains</a>: \"While computers and the internet can be extremely powerful tools for advocacy, they also present new risks for a group that is already, in many cases, quite vulnerable. As more advocates have begun to rely on digital technology to achieve their outreach, data-collection, information design, communication and mobilisation objectives, these risks have become more severe.\"</p><p>So as the use of information communication technologies by development organisations continues to grow, how do we define what works and why? What are the best ways to manage some of the challenges outlined above and how can activists take advantage of the opportunities while minimising the risks?</p><p>Join our live chat panel this Thursday, 11 April, from 1-3pm BST to share your experiences and lessons learnt when using ICTs for social justice work.</p><p><em>The live chat is not video or audio-enabled but will take place in the comments section (below).

The president will be standing in the dock accused of atrocities while also running the region's biggest economy. But so far, it is not Kenyatta on trial in the court of world opinion but the international criminal court, for which this is seen as a defining moment.</p><p>First, Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled Uganda for 27 years, highlighted a stain that the ICC seems unable to wash away, the perception that it is an instrument of the west that is inherently biased against Africa. From Joseph Kony up, all suspects indicted by the court to date are Africans, even if investigations are being conducted elsewhere and the current chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, is from Gambia.</p><p>Second, the case against Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, which relates to their alleged orchestration of violence after the last election, is thought by many to be unravelling. Last month prosecutors dropped a crimes against humanity case against co-accused politician Francis Muthaura after a key witness admitted lying – the first time in the 10-year-old court's history that they have dropped a case so close to trial.</p><p>This is not necessarily owing to ICC incompetence. Bensouda has described the scale of interference with witnesses in the Kenya cases as \"unprecedented\". Some have<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21382339\" title=\"\"> allegedly \"disappeared</a>\" or been offered bribes to withdraw. Victims have repeatedly highlighted their safety concerns in court. One journalist who has followed the case for years told me: \"If I was a witness, there is no way I would stick my neck out to testify. My life would not be safe.\"</p><p>Don't expect the west to ask awkward questions about such matters; a collapse of the case against Kenyatta, due to stand trial at The Hague in July, would suit the UK and US just fine. They are preparing for the awkward etiquette of arm's length diplomatic relations with the new man. Tuesday's inauguration may be a template: Britain, America and EU countries sent no one more or less senior than ambassador. The UK's standard position on ICC indictees is to avoid all contact unless \"essential\".</p><p>As a signatory of the Rome statute of the ICC, Kenya would be forced to act on any arrest warrant issued by the court should Kenyatta refuse to attend trial. But unlike the Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, Kenyatta has promised to fully co-operate. This has earned him brownie points with one of the ICC's most prominent champions, Human Rights Watch. \"Given their voluntary appearance before the ICC, Human Rights Watch does not oppose diplomatic contacts with Kenyatta and Ruto,\" the <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/node/114722%C2%A38\" title=\"\">watchdog says</a>.</p><p>Pointing to the Sudan example, analysts believe that the west can quite comfortably continue to interact with various government agencies while keeping contact with Kenyatta and Ruto to a minimum.</p><p>And \"business as usual\" seems the most likely outcome because of sheer pragmatism. Kenya is too big to ignore. British companies are heavily invested in its economy. Kenyan troops are helping battle Islamist militants inside Somalia, and Kenya hosts a US military base near the Somali border.</p><p>Kenyatta, for all his pro-eastern, anti-western rhetoric, is a graduate from Amherst College in the US, uses a British lawyer for his ICC trial and has Britons among his advisers. The EU is a big donor and significant importer of Kenyan produce, while the US provides about $900m (£588m) in aid a year. Any hint of sanctions or economic disruption could torpedo his ambitious promises to create jobs and invest in technology.</p><p>All of which means that it is of mutual interest for both sides not to rock the boat, and hope that the ICC case quietly fades away. Which will be of no consolation to the victims of the election carnage that left more than 1,100 people dead, who five years on are still awaiting justice.</p><p>\"We don't want instability and we don't want impunity,\" said Mwalimu Mati, a civil society activist and anti-corruption campaigner in Nairobi. \"I think an accommodation will be reached over time. If Kenyatta's challenges to the ICC case succeed, you will probably see the west attitudes mellow. Kenya is important and has proclaimed itself important. But in all of this we've forgotten the victims and human injustice.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/4/9/1365530032919/Uhuru-Kenyatta-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/09/uhuru-kenyatta-inauguration-icc","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/apr/09/uhuru-kenyatta-inauguration-icc","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Kenya's Maasai keep lions at bay with solar power and ingenuity | David Smith","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-08T06:00:08Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2013/apr/08/kenya-maasai-lions-solar-power","fields":{"body":"<p>When it came to keeping hungry lions at bay, an old-fashioned scarecrow just wasn't up to the job.

The young Kenyan has been lauded as an inspiration after giving a recent <a href=\"http://on.ted.com/Turere\" title=\"\">TED talk</a> about his invention.</p><p>Turere lives in Kitengela on the edge of Nairobi national park.

The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock, and they're also upset about this problem. So they <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/six-lions-speared-death-nairobi-livestock\" title=\"\">kill the lions</a> … And I think this is why the Nairobi national park lions are few.\"</p><p>Turere said he tried various ideas for a more peaceful solution, such as a kerosene lamp and a scarecrow. \"But lions are very clever. They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back, but the second day, they'll come and they say, this thing is not moving here, it's always here. So he jumps in and kills the animals.\"</p><p>But, one night, Turere went to the cowshed with a torch and found that the lions stayed away. \"I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.\"</p><p>The teenager – who has a knack for making things from scrapyard parts – bought a car battery, motorcycle indicator box, switches, torch bulbs and solar panel, and hooked them together. It worked, and now dozens of lion lights <a href=\"http://lionlights.wildlifedirect.org/2013/03/13/lights\" title=\"\">have been rigged up around Kenya</a>.</p><p>As a consequence, Turere gained a scholarship to one of the country's top schools, delivered a TED talk in Longbeach, California, last month, and has ambitions to be an aircraft engineer and pilot when he grows up.</p><p>\"I used to hate lions,\" he adds, \"but now, because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions, we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/4/2/1364922612315/A-lion-in-Nairobis-Nation-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/08/kenya-maasai-lions-solar-power","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/apr/08/kenya-maasai-lions-solar-power","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Development goals?

The fight for democracy has also turned inward, with complaints that the forum itself is not diverse or representative enough.</p><p></p><p>Organisers estimate more than 50,000 people from 4,500 organisations and 127 countries attended last week's gathering, which closed on Saturday and brought together participants in the so-called \"new social movements\" – like Occupy and 13M – with Tunisian revolutionaries and veteran alter-globalisation activists.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of simultaneous events included a training course for Arabic bloggers and citizen journalists, an \"international meeting of victims of housing markets\", and a workshop on free-trade agreements in the Mediterranean. Workshops focused on tax justice, debt campaigns and climate change.

Why didn't it come through the media?\"</p><p></p><p>Participation has become a key watchword of NGOs and institutions eager to avoid accusations of top-down, paternalistic approaches to development. The UN has in recent months held a series of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/mar/21/equality-jobs-governance-migration-consultations\" title=\"\">thematic and national consultations</a> and launched <a href=\"http://www.myworld2015.org/\" title=\"\">My World</a>, a global survey of citizen priorities.</p><p></p><p>But Benavides says the process has gone too fast and reached too few.

In addition to those held by the UN, it is organising national consultations on the future of development in dozens of countries, hoping to gather grassroots input to influence the high-level conversation.

It's early morning and the hospital is already filling up with patients, mostly mothers with young children. However, there are also students here for training on how to use new equipment that will provide critical feedback to patients with HIV – <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/globalreport/\" title=\"\">11.5% of 15- to 49-year-olds</a> in Mozambique.</p><p></p><p>The rate has been stable for the past five years, but remains high. Innovative technologies to quickly and accurately diagnose and monitor HIV are being rolled out by the <a href=\"http://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/our-work/by-initiative/clinton-health-access-initiative/about.html\" title=\"\">Clinton Health Access Initiative</a>, <a href=\"http://www.msf-me.org/en/mission/in-the-field/msf-projects-world-wide/mozambique-1.html\" title=\"\">Médecins sans Frontières</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/mozambique/\" title=\"\">Unicef</a>. The trials, funded by <a href=\"http://www.unitaid.eu\" title=\"\">Unitaid</a>, are to improve diagnosis of children under 18 months, and tests to assess all patients' immunity levels. They enable health workers to monitor levels of the virus in the blood, and can determine when a patient needs to switch from first-line to second-line antiretrovirals. The equipment is adapted for low-tech settings, and patients will be able to be tested and treated nearer their homes.</p><p></p><p>The top floor of Polana Caniço hosts a pristine research facility that works with a community advisory board to map the area's needs. This year the centre is carrying out an HIV incidence study in the neighbourhood, which has thousands of small homes, mostly brick built, usually with corrugated iron roofs held down with stones or tyres.</p><p></p><p>Dr Ilesh Jani, director of the <a href=\"http://www.ins.gov.mz/\" title=\"\">Instituo Nacional de Saúde de Moçambique</a> (national institute of health), says that although there has been progress in HIV treatment, something better is still needed – such as the machines his team is testing.</p><p></p><p>The usual tests, where a child's status is assessed with a dry blood spot test which is sent to one of four labs in Mozambique, are less accurate and results take longer – it takes up to two months for the results to come back to the health centre. Just as with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/mar/12/mozambique-technology-battle-tuberculosis\" title=\"\">tuberculosis testing</a>, logistics are a challenge and some families never come back to hear the outcome. With the new equipment, using a blood sample from a finger tip, results are back in just over an hour.</p><p></p><p>According to Jani, it is estimated that half of untreated children die before the age of two due to the delays. \"Some issues are solved by technology, but it won't solve all the problems. We need to invest in the health systems too. By the end of 2013, 25% of all patients in HIV programmes will have access to CD4 counts [to measure the strength of the immune system to resist the virus] – that's between 800,000 and 1 million patients.\"</p><p></p><p>About 400 centres across Mozambique now have printers that can quickly receive test results by GPRS (similar to SMS but cheaper, and with the data codified to ensure confidentiality, a contribution from <a href=\"http://www.mcel.co.mz/\" title=\"\">mcel</a>, a Mozambican mobile phone company).</p><p></p><p>But accurately testing children remains a challenge in much of the country. Adults are normally diagnosed on the basis of antibodies, but when babies are born they still have those of their mother, so it is not possible to confirm whether the baby is positive. Instead, the new machines test for <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/10000207\" title=\"\">viral load</a>, to verify if the virus is in the blood.</p><p></p><p>The Mozambican health system has not implemented viral load testing, so patients are treated according to their CD4 count. Conventional viral load testing is expensive, and requires significant infrastructure and well-trained technicians. The machines now being trialled can be used in basic settings by lab technicians – each one comes with a printer and charger so it can run for eight hours without mains electricity.</p><p></p><p>Being able to offer both tests will help Mozambique catch up with parts of South Africa and Kenya. Jani says: \"If HIV is a train that is moving at a certain speed, the viral load is the speed of the train and the CD4 is the station at which the train is. These are two different measurements and CD4 is normally used to choose which patients go on treatment, but once the person is on treatment, viral load is used to monitor if the treatment is working.\"</p><p></p><h2>Preventing mother-to-child transmission</h2><p></p><p>In Mozambique, <a href=\"http://www.cncs.org.mz/index.php/por/HIV-SIDA-em-Mocambique\" title=\"\">15% of pregnant women</a> between 15 and 49 are HIV positive. Testing among expectant mothers increased from 12% in 2005 to 87% in 2010. About <a href=\"http://www.unaidsrstesa.org/resources/reports/progress-report-2011-global-hivaids-response\" title=\"\">85% of antenatal care facilities offer prevention services</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.misau.gov.mz/index.php/entrada\" title=\"\">health ministry</a> has developed a national plan towards elimination of mother-to-child transmission by 2015.</p><p></p><p>The situation is improving – in 2010, 42% of children born needing ARVs received them, but <a href=\"http://www.unaidsrstesa.org/resources/reports/progress-report-2011-global-hivaids-response\" title=\"\">only 34% of infants born to pregnant women with HIV were tested within two months of birth</a> – hence the need for more accurate and speedy testing.</p><p></p><p>Roberto de Bernardi, deputy representative for Unicef Mozambique, acknowledges the room for improvement but recognises that the government's decision to integrate testing and drug provision into general health provision has avoided the very real issue of stigmatisation that parallel support would have risked.</p><p></p><p>The national institute of health has ambitious plans. It is doing preliminary work on vaccinations against HIV and is part of a <a href=\"http://youfly.co.tz/tamovac/index.php\" title=\"\">consortium with institutions in Tanzania</a>, Sweden, the UK, US and Germany. Jani says it is vital for Mozambique to carry out research: \"Mozambique is one of those countries most affected by these issues. We need to get involved and be driving progress, not just sitting in the back seat. We all hope to find a product that will significantly lower incidence of HIV and we're hoping the products will be available in an affordable format.\"</p><p></p><p><em>• Lucy Lamble travelled to Mozambique with Unitaid</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/3/20/1363794445265/MDG-Hiv-in-Mozambique-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/mar/21/mozambique-leads-frontbattle-aids","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/mar/21/mozambique-leads-frontbattle-aids","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Beyond financial inclusion","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-20T17:06:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network/dai-partner-zone","id":"global-development-professionals-network/dai-partner-zone/beyond-financial-inclusion","fields":{"body":"<p>The term 'financial inclusion' has rapidly entered the mainstream policy discourse in the past seven years. Outside of its natural home in the development community and the financial sector, it now features regularly even in tightly worded G20 Summit communiques.</p><p>This recognition follows decades of loud activism by some and quiet fieldwork by others. Starting in the 1970s, pioneers like Muhammed Yunus of Grameen Bank not only recognised that poor people wanted and could repay small loans, but they went on to promote the proposition that scaling the microcredit sector was in fact an important part of a development agenda. The UN year of Microcredit in 2006 represented both the apogee of that movement and the beginnings of a subtle shift to the broader but more elusive concept of 'inclusive financial sectors'.</p><p>Seven years later, there is no standard definition of financial inclusion. This definitional vacuum is both a strength, in that it provides flexibility for different countries to develop their own, and a weakness, in that the concept remains amorphous for many. Financial inclusion just does not catch public imagination in the way that the concept of access to credit as a human right did in its heyday (before the financial crisis). </p><p>The numerous definitions applied by different countries and international agencies are marked by subtle differences. Some emphasise reducing exclusion, referring to those outside the reach of formal financial system, often in specific demographic segments — rural women and youth, for example. Other definitions go beyond access to services to include usage of the services by the intended group. All definitions favor participation in the formal financial sector, where services are provided by regulated financial institutions, over unregulated services. Ambitious targets adopted by countries as part of the G20-backed Maya Declaration, promoted by the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, enshrine multiyear plans to raise the number of people using the financial system to 75 percent of the population, for example, or to roll out branches or agents in large numbers to improve access.</p><p>But we're not in the 2000s anymore. The age of apparent innocence about the inherent goodness of providing more financial services for more people has been shattered by the U.S. housing credit bust and by the grim stories coming out of the microfinance sector in certain Indian states. Of course, credit bubbles and busts are nothing new, as recent authors like Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart have reminded us (This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, 2009). But as the financial sector has widened and deepened in many countries, in part following the cheerleading of inclusion advocates, the effects of volatility in supply — boom one day, credit rationing the next — are simply felt by more people, including more vulnerable people. </p><p>We live also in an age of fast-growing fiscal pressure in many countries that have promoted microfinance internationally, forcing reconsideration of national expenditure priorities. In an age of austerity, no development programs have an automatic right to ongoing funding, least of all those touched by controversy, like financial services. Meanwhile, the regulatory backlash against excesses in the financial sector is felt well beyond the ground zero of financial crisis in the West, leading to increased compliance costs and risk aversion among financial institutions and making it costlier to reach unbanked people.</p><p>So, even as policy makers rush to embrace financial inclusion, there is a risk that the tide is going out under their very feet; and that their commitments become increasingly symbolic rather than concrete. Symbolism is not per se harmful, but for those who want to see development in action, what's the alternative to promoting financial inclusion? </p><p>First, there is certainly no need to coin yet another name for it — financial inclusion adequately captures the sense of the wider range of appropriate financial services people need, want, and therefore use for their wellbeing. And more effort spent on reaching definitional precision on how to measure financial inclusion may not the best use of scarcer resources.</p><p>Instead, rather than perform more definitional gymnastics, we need to put the concept itself in its place:  financial inclusion is only ever a means, not an end. People don't want credit: they want what credit will buy them — a house, a business, a car, an education. This means articulating more clearly how inclusion connects to real needs and societal priorities, such as the creation of micro-enterprise, alleviation of poverty, and empowerment of women. This is not always easy to do, but it is vital.  </p><p>This 'right-placing' also means that it is increasingly important to look 'beneath the hood' and evaluate efforts which ostensibly promote inclusion but in fact leave bitter fruit behind — in credit markets, for example. It is no longer enough to be financially included, however that is defined. Instead, financial inclusion should be conceived as a tool, its use and application judged and re-calibrated by how it contributes toward robust economies and communities. </p><p>Much as we learn to evaluate the use of any tool over time ('useful in this circumstance, not for that'), we need also to revisit some of our assumptions about this tool. For example, the strong bias toward formality. In the long shadow of the financial crisis, it behooves us to be more modest in asserting the benefits — in all circumstances, at all costs — of formal over informal services. Evidence from places like Kenya, which has seen rapid increases in formal financial inclusion as the result of the application of mobile technology, suggests that mobile payments have not so far led to much greater use of other formal financial services, but they have made a profound difference in people's their lives through enabling, supporting, and resourcing familial and other <a href=\"http://www.fsdkenya.org/pdf_documents/12-03-23_FinLandscapes_summary_report.pdf\"rel=\"nofollow\">social networks</a>.</p><p><em>David Porteous is the Managing Director of <a href=\"http://bankablefrontier.com/\"rel=\"Nofollow\">Bankable Frontier Associates</a>, a specialist consultancy based in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

What these groups have in common is a need for information and public libraries can provide the answer.</p><p>There are over 320,000 public libraries worldwide, 230,000 of which are in developing countries. The potential of these institutions to support development goals is being underused. Public libraries, if properly supported, offer their users access to resources which can help improve their economic and social wellbeing.</p><p>Why public libraries? First of all, they already exist. It's that simple. Public libraries, whatever the level of their funding, are physical spaces that are <a href=\"http://www.ifla.org/publications/iflaunesco-public-library-manifesto-1994\" title=\"\">incorporated into government frameworks and strategies</a>. They have dedicated, ongoing budgets for staff and information resources and a <a href=\"http://www.eifl.net/system/files/201111/perceptions_of_public_libraries_in_africa_-_full_report_hi.pdf\" title=\"\">positive feeling across communities</a> that their potential could be unlocked with greater government attention. Publicly supported libraries offer sustainability that narrow, project-focused approaches do not.</p><p>Public libraries increasingly offer public access to the internet and all of the information resources it can provide. This is fundamental to understanding the potential they offer in terms of empowering people to meet their information needs. Despite massive growth in global internet penetration, we cannot pretend that the digital divide is a thing of the past. Worldwide only 35% of the global population are online, and public access will play a huge role in giving the remainder of the population access to the internet. A <a href=\"http://tascha.uw.edu/2013/02/global-impact-study-will-release-final-report-soon/\" title=\"\">major forthcoming study</a> on the benefits of public access makes this point effectively.</p><p>Public libraries also offer expertise. Dedicated staff provide advice which can be the difference between users simply accessing information or being able to use it. Staff <a href=\"http://www.beyondaccess.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Beyond-Access-Libraries-MDGs-Small.pdf%3e\" title=\"\">are able to help</a> farmers and fisherman use the Internet to better promote their products, or students <a href=\"http://www.eifl.net/busia-community-library-kenya#node-2676\" title=\"\">improve their exam results</a>. Public libraries can offer something for everyone in the community – the children and youth, <a href=\"http://www.beyondaccess.net/2012/10/18/empowering-women-and-girls-through-ict-at-libraries-october-issue-brief/\" title=\"\">women and girls</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.eifl.net/ulaanbaatar-city-public-library-mongolia\" title=\"\">vulnerable</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eifl.net/zagreb-city-libraries-croatia\" title=\"\">marginalised</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.eifl.net/east-kazakhstan-oblast-pushkin-library-kazakhstan\" title=\"\">entrepreneur</a> and established businessman, the <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/william_kamkwamba_on_building_a_windmill.html\" title=\"\">inventor</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.eifl.net/ghana-library-board-northern-regional-library#node-2670\" title=\"\">health worker</a>.</p><p>Policymakers, funders and development agencies need to start looking at the potential of libraries as partners in development activities, and libraries themselves must be doing more to draw attention to the services they can offer. My organisation, the <a href=\"http://www.ifla.org/ict4d\" title=\"\">International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions</a>, is the global organistion representing libraries and is an agenda-setting agency in this regard. Recently, we have been trying to raise awareness through the <a href=\"http://www.beyondaccess.net/\" title=\"\">Beyond Access</a> initiative. Last October, Beyond Access hosted a major conference in Washington DC that featured Dr Rajiv Shah, the administrator of USAid, and Ricardo Lagos, the former president of Chile. Chile benefited greatly from a <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2001/08/GlobalLibrariesPR010813\" title=\"\">major library funding programme</a> in the last decade that connected all of its 368 public libraries to the internet and Lagos became a convert to the potential of libraries.</p><p>The Beyond Access conference bought three-person teams of librarians, development workers and government representatives from 19 countries to Washington to show a audience of 300 development organisation representatives, funders and policymakers the innovative projects libraries are undertaking worldwide. Library projects in Nepal, Bhutan, Serbia, Kenya and Uganda received <a href=\"http://www.beyondaccess.net/2012/10/10/libraries-for-development-contest-winners-announced/\" title=\"\">awards</a> for their work in the areas of civic participation, economic opportunity, community information and development, and public technology and innovation.</p><p>Projects like these need to be communicated to the donor community, as well as policymakers and workers in the business sector. Libraries have the ability to partner across multiple sectors and we can already see success stories in places like <a href=\"http://www.beyondaccess.net/2012/01/12/libraries-and-development-in-ghana/\" title=\"\">Ghana</a>, where businesses are helping libraries provide public access to the internet, or in Serbia, where <a href=\"http://www.eifl.net/eifl-plip-innovation-award/award-1-economic-wellbeing#europe\" title=\"\">Belgrade City Library</a> provides training in basic financial tools. Librarians themselves need to be more proactive in terms of raising the visibility of the work they do in the community – they are traditionally a little too shy when it comes to extolling the benefits of their work, preferring instead to keep their heads down and get on with things – but we also need the development community to be open to the idea of using <a href=\"http://www.beyondaccess.net/tag/partnerships/\" title=\"\">public libraries as partners</a> in projects to improve life in developing countries. The Electronic Information for Libraries <a href=\"http://www.eifl.net/Our-grantees\" title=\"\">Public library innovation project</a> has many examples that show just what public libraries can bring to the table.</p><p>Let's finish with a high-level, big fuss example. The <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\" title=\"\">Open Government Partnership</a> is rightly highlighting the benefits that open government data can bring to individuals and communities. But of the 47 governments who have so far signed up to the OGP only three have action plans that address the demand side of open government – who is going to tell citizens that there is data available, and who is going to give those without home computers access to it? <a href=\"http://www.ifla.org/news/igf-baku-workshop-189-outcomes-open-government-data-for-citizens-by-citizens-about-citizens\" title=\"\">Libraries can</a>: in Romania, for example, over 400 public libraries helped 17,000 farmers access government portals to obtain agricultural subsidies <a href=\"http://www.irex.org/news/romanian-libraries-forefront-e-government\" title=\"\">that brought back over $20m (£13.3m)</a> into their communities. Partnering with existing public library networks is an excellent way of delivering development-based initiatives at the local level. IFLA is convinced that at a time of tight budgets, public libraries offer a more efficient, smarter way of <a href=\"http://www.beyondaccess.net/2012/10/03/libraries-power-development-heres-how/\" title=\"\">powering development</a>.</p><p><em>Stuart Hamilton is director of policy and advocacy, at the <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/\">International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions</a>.

At the international citizen media news site <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/\">Global Voices</a>, 764 women have written 51% of all posts, a trend they have held consistent for years, our data shows.</p><p>It's reasonable to be downcast about the role of women in the news. In the UK, newspaper <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/oct/15/women-newspapers-front-pages\">front pages rarely include women</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/sep/07/gender-media-best-data-available\">women write a minority of articles</a>. Women are prominent at the Daily Mail, where they write most of the celebrity news, fewer news articles, and almost no sport. Even when publications do include women, they're often at the mercy of their audiences. 20% of Telegraph opinion articles are written by women, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/oct/23/women-media-representation-online-news\">women's opinion articles attract only 14% of the Telegraph's shares and likes </a>on social media.</p><p>Monday, Vida Web Women in Literary Arts released their annual byline count, highlighting the substantial <a href=\"http://www.vidaweb.org/the-count-2012\">absence of women from many literary magazines</a>. Women's books are a minority of book reviews in many publications, even though <a href=\"http://blogger.ghostweather.com/2012/08/uk-bestsellers-remash-by-genre-and.html\">women write the majority of UK fiction bestsellers</a>, as data scientist<a href=\"http://twitter.com/arnicas\"> Lynn Cherny</a> has shown. The disparity between bestsellers and reviews makes the literary arts different from opinion writing, at least in the US, where <a href=\"http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/its_2012_already_why_is_opinio.php?page=all\">mentoring strategies are increasing the visibility of women</a>.</p><h2>Gender diversity at Global Voices</h2><p><a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/\">Global Voices</a> is a global news site that translates and explains events and issues worldwide. A typical post, like <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/05/kenyans-flood-polls-despite-election-day-violence/\">this story on Monday's election in Kenya</a>, curates tweets, citizen photos, and news articles for an international audience. Global Voices also translates and amplifies short summaries of content from regional sites, like this update on <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/03/06/harlem-shake-rocks-central-asia/\">the best Central Asian Harlem Shake videos</a>. Although editors are paid, most translators and writers are volunteers.</p><p>Volunteer sites like Wikipedia often have trouble attracting women contributors, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/sep/11/wikipedia-editor-gender-interactive\">women Wikipedians tend toward only some kinds of stories</a>. That's not true at Global Voices, where women's writing is strong across all regions. Even in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of posts are written by men, women are writing nearly 40% of the posts. In contrast, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/sep/11/wikipedia-editor-gender-interactive\">only 33%</a> of the Guardian's news articles and 19% of the Telegraph's news articles include women as writers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405208818'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/7/1362677619787/Article-by-gender-and-cat-008.jpg' alt='Article by gender and category, Global Voices graphic' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>However you slice it, Global Voices publishes a diverse set of voices at all levels of participation, from the most prolific to the most casual. Here's the gender breakdown grouped by the number of posts a writer has contributed:</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405208819'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/7/1362677752753/Gender-breakdown-by-posts-001.jpg' alt='Gender breakdown by posts per author' width='460' height='223' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>How to create diversity in the news</h2><p>Critiques of newsrooms' lack of diversity tend to focus on employment choices and editorial practices. Online, says <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/author/solana-larsen/\">Solana Larsen</a>, managing editor of Global Voices, a diverse newsroom benefits from choosing balanced leadership, building teams that value difference, setting norms, and searching for unlikely paths to participation.</p><p>Balanced leadership can't substitute for outreach. In a Skype interview, Solana told us that Global Voices started as a cooperation between Rebecca McKinnon and Ethan Zuckerman at Harvard University. Women have been prominent editors since its founding in 2004, but diversity was limited by the lack of women in the tech, law, and university settings where it started. As our data shows, gender diversity expanded as Global Voices grew to include more countries and contexts. Global Voices also funds initiatives to <a href=\"http://summit2012.globalvoicesonline.org/2012/07/rising-voices-wiring-offgrid-villages-preserving-language-online/\">connect off-grid villages</a> and help underrepresented voices find an audience online.</p><p>It's important to make gender diversity the norm, Solana tells us. Because Global Voices expects it, editors tend to notice obvious gaps. The Middle East/North Africa section is especially focused on diversity; editors will urge women to speak up, sending emails to the internal list saying \"Come on MENA Women, let's show these men.\"<br /><a href=\"http://sammeier.policymic.com/\"><br />Sam Meier</a>, gender editor at the opinion site PolicyMic, agrees. PolicyMic is a New York startup that's <a href=\"http://www.policymic.com/articles/21775/behind-the-scenes-what-2012-was-really-like-at-policymic\">opening the editorial process to voting from the audience</a>. Recruitment is still important, and Sam looks for new writers in places where women are already using their voices, like the social blogging service Tumblr. Even then, it's important to set norms, she says. At sites with \"a good track record of addressing diversity, there are often a few key people who have identified holes in coverage, have been able to see that a demographic is missing, and have done something to redress it.\" </p><p>Paths to participation are changing in surprising ways at Global Voices, Solana tells us. Their outreach once looked like PolicyMic's: a search for regional bloggers to mentor for a broader audience. Now that blogs are shrinking in popularity, Global Voices is finding new writers among translators. New translators start because they want to share a post with people in their language. After they become regular translators, they notice gaps in coverage and want to fill them. Global Voices tracks conversion rates on translators becoming full writers, supporting the transition to using their own voice in public.</p><h2><br />Tracking gender diversity in news content</h2><p>We did our analysis of Global Voices with <a href=\"http://opengendertracking.github.com/\">Open Gender Tracker</a>, an open source, deployable service funded by a <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/funding-initiatives/knight-prototype-fund/\">Knight Foundation Prototype grant</a>. Our software calculates the diversity breakdown of digital content using metrics like author gender. It builds on the methods from an earlier Guardian DataBlog post on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/oct/23/women-media-representation-online-news\">gender in the UK news</a> last autumn and an analysis of Twitter sources used in<a href=\"http://pbs.org/idealab/2012/08/did-global-voices-use-diverse-sources-on-twitter-for-arab-spring-coverage228.html\"> Global Voices coverage of the Arab Spring</a>.</p><p>To track gender on Global Voices, we obtained the full archives of the site from 2005-2012 and loaded the data into Open Gender Tracker. The software automatically estimated the gender of the writers, based on author first names. The Global Voices community filled the gaps for names our software missed. We made one other adjustment. Most posts on Global Voices are single-paragraph links to other sites, written by the editors. We filtered out those links to focus on original content.</p><p>Open Gender Tracker is open source software.

But if they are to handle their own activities they have to listen to each other just as much. This puts a high value on talk and exchange as development activities and as process objectives.</p><p><strong>Look beyond perceived needs:</strong> Some needs are quite clear to clients but in some fields, such as nutrition education, a real difficulty is that needs are not perceived. This can be true at all levels, from the general population through to policy-makers and international organisations.

Also, organisations must be responsive to community feedback, and re-design their projects if necessary.

For most, epic queues and computer glitches were a bigger headache than the much-predicted tribal conflagration.</p><p>Provisional results, based on more than a quarter of polling stations reporting, showed Uhuru Kenyatta – who is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/03/kenyatta-kenya-election-2013\">due to stand trial at the international criminal court</a> – leading with 55% of the vote, well ahead of his main rival, Raila Odinga, on 40%.</p><p>Throughout most of the country millions of Kenyans waited in long lines and cast their ballots in peace.  Monday's election was Kenya's first since more than 1,000 people were killed in violence following its December 2007 presidential election.</p><p>But this was the easy part. There are still many hurdles to come, as a tight contest for the presidency could lead to a run-off vote and ugly disputes both in the courts and on the streets.</p><p>East Africa's biggest economy is desperate to avoid a repeat of 2007's ethnic violence that left more than 1,100 people dead and 600,000 displaced.</p><p>Officials, candidates and media have made impassioned pleas for peace, and there is extraordinary international scrutiny and pressure.</p><p>Before dawn, early-bird Kenyans blew whistles and trumpet-like vuvuzelas to wake the country's <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201212201696.html\" title=\"\">14.3 million voters</a>. With queues forming well before polls opened at 6am, it soon became clear the turnout would be \"huge\", officials said, possibly a record. The system struggled to cope with the demand, and some voters waited up to 10 hours to cast their ballots.</p><p>Anti-fraud fingerprint-based voter-ID technology, introduced to counter the allegations of rigging that erupted last time, broke down in many areas. Officials said many polling stations opened late and there were problems with transporting election material.</p><p>In the capital, Nairobi, there were few cars on the streets but long lines of people snaking for several hundreds of metres, some holding umbrellas to deflect blazing sunshine.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.kibera.org.uk/Facts.html\" title=\"\">Kibera</a>, the biggest slum in Africa and a potential flashpoint, a man in a Manchester United shirt could be seen painting \"Peace\" in the middle of the road. Speed bumps had been decorated with the words \"Peace wanted alive\" and \"Peace love unity\" with the CND symbol.</p><p>Thousands of people queued patiently past goats, open sewers, piles of uncollected rubbish and walls coated from top to bottom with weathered campaign posters. Most of the rickety market stalls and corrugated iron shops were shuttered.</p><p>Odinga, who has been MP for Kibera for 20 years, voted at a local primary school and said: \"Never before have Kenyans turned up in such numbers. I'm sure they're going to vote for change this election.\"</p><p>Others faced a longer wait to vote at the school, where the much-heralded computer system had been knocked out by flat batteries, forcing staff to revert to manual registration.</p><p>\"I expected the computers to work and I'm getting frustrated,\" said Eric Wasike, 27, a computer repair man who had been queuing for five hours. But, like many here, he believed the outcome could improve lives in Kibera. \"It's important to vote because in the past politicians looked after their own needs, but now I'm going to vote for a person who will bring change in society. The next generation will benefit from it.\"</p><p>He added:  All of us are optimistic. No matter what the outcome, Kenya will remain Kenya. We don't need to resort to violence to get our rights. The entire world is watching us and we are going to set an example. We don't want a repeat of what happened last time.\"</p><p>Further back in the queue, Ibrahim Hassan, 49, a driver, said: \"It's OK to wait, because we are trying to make history. If you want to do something good, you have to be patient.\"</p><p>But Janet Wasike, 19, cradling her one-month-old son, Fabian, had arrived to discover her name was missing. \"I'm feeling bad because I've lost my vote,\" she said.</p><p>Elsewhere, in Starehe constituency, voices were raised as people argued with officials but the mood was mostly calm. Mohamed Mahmoud, 54, a retail manager wearing sunglasses and a flamboyant patterned shirt, said: \"It's the first time I've seen so many people eager to come out and vote. Definitely it will end peacefully. People have learned a lesson from 2007. The new constitution has changed the landscape. Both sides have persuaded Kenyans to accept defeat peacefully and I don't think they will go back on their word.\"</p><p>Mohammed Ahmed, 23, a student, was stuck at the back of the mammoth queue. \"I feel disgusted, I feel like going home. There's an option to wait until 2017 [the next election]. But I want to cast my vote to change the way things are going.\"</p><p>Around the port city of Mombasa, however, the day got off to the kind of start many had been dreading: 200 members of a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/21578446\" title=\"\">coastal separatist</a> group armed with guns, machetes and bows and arrows set a trap for police in the pre-dawn hours, killing five officers, Kenyan police inspector general David Kimaiyo said. One attacker also died.</p><p>A second attack by secessionists in nearby Kilifi killed one police officer and five attackers, Kimaiyo added. A Kilifi police official, Clemence Wangai, said seven people had died in that assault, including an election official.</p><p>A spokesman for the separatist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/06/kenya-ocean-coast-secessionist-party\" title=\"\">Mombasa Republican Council</a> denied it was behind the assaults. \"We are not responsible for any attacks anywhere in this region,\" Mohammed Rashid Mraja told Reuters, adding that the group sought change through peaceful means only.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab urged Muslims not to vote and repeated calls for Kenya to withdraw its peacekeepers from Somalia. A grenade attack on a police post in Garissa, a city near Somalia, killed two civilians, police said. A bomb exploded in the Mandera area, also near the border, causing no fatalities.</p><p>Farah Maalim, deputy speaker of parliament, said the attacks on the Garissa polling stations took place after dark. Gunshots and an explosion rang out as gunmen stormed the stations and seized election material. Separate attacks on the coast killed 19 people early on Monday.</p><p>About 99,000 police officers were on duty during the election. Along with the presidential race, there are hotly contested elections for senators, county governors, members of parliament, female representatives in county assemblies and civic leaders.</p><p>Christopher Kibanzanga, an election observer from Uganda's National Consultative Council, told the Associated Press: \"This can only be likened to South Africa when [President Nelson] Mandela was elected. The people have turned up in large numbers. The spirit of patriotism and nationalism has come back. I think this is a perfect process.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2013/3/4/1362424535467/Kenyans-queue-at-a-pollin-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/04/kenya-vote-kenyatta-odinga-violence","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/mar/04/kenya-vote-kenyatta-odinga-violence","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Kenyan elections marred by Mombasa violence","webPublicationDate":"2013-03-04T13:22:38Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2013/mar/04/kenyan-elections-marred-mombasa-violence","fields":{"body":"<p>Violence has flared on election day in Kenya, with at least 13 people killed in co-ordinated attacks on the coast.</p><p>A group of 200 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/06/kenya-ocean-coast-secessionist-party\" title=\"\">Mombasa Republican Council (MRC) secessionists</a> armed with guns, machetes and bows and arrows set a trap for police before dawn, killing five officers, the Kenyan police inspector general, David Kimaiyo, said.

A row of corrugated iron shops hawk traditional Masai cloths, soapstone chess sets and handcarved elephant, lion and zebra bookends. But today there are not many tourists to barter.</p><p>Down in the valley there's a clue as to why. Sunshine gleams off the metal roofs of housing built for families displaced by ethnic violence that followed Kenya's general election five years ago. More than 1,100 people were killed and 600,000 fled their homes. On Monday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/26/kenya-election-debate-failed\" title=\"\">the nation goes to the polls again</a> in possibly the most important vote in its 50-year history. Many fear a repeat.</p><p>To outside eyes it is hard to believe that the most powerful country in the region, with its vibrant middle class, boutique malls and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/kenya-silicon-savannah-digital-technology\" title=\"\">thriving tech sector</a>, could be on the brink of catastrophe. But every five years, its foundations are shaken by the democratic cycle. Already in recent months more than 200 people have been killed in politically charged violence in the Tana river region and in the north. The fact that one of the front runners for the presidency has been indicted by the international criminal court is another portent of trouble ahead.</p><p>The Rift Valley in particular has become accustomed to these convulsions. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are still living with the consequences of the politically fuelled tribal conflict in 2007-08.</p><p>Margaret Wambui Mwai, 65, is 280km from her home village and mourning her son, Joshua, who was hacked to death in the post-election eruption. \"I last saw him the day before he died,\" she recalls, halting as her eyes cloud with tears. \"He said 'Goodnight, I'm going to bed, you won't see me in the morning.' He was a carpenter so he spent the whole day at the workshop. He was supporting the whole family.</p><p>\"The next time I saw him he was lying dead. He had been hacked to death on his way back from work. The memory still haunts me.

We ran away, we didn't salvage anything, we left our things to burn. It was a very frightening time. We had to run in the middle of the night. We could only carry the very young; boys of 10 had to run for themselves, then we had to look for them the next day.\"</p><p>The widow, whose arms are deeply wrinkled and coated in dust, now lives alone in a spartan grey brick house with floors and walls that are bare save for a garish colour image of Christ. Does she fear another lethal election? \"I'm highly religious, I believe in God. I think we will not fight again.\"</p><p>An informal settlement of some 6,000 families has sprung up in the Maai Mahiu area beneath majestic green hills, according to the local chief. But not all are officially recognised as IDPs and entitled to benefits. For Mary Nseri, 35, a single mother of six children, life is much tougher than it was five years ago, when she fled her burning home.</p><p>\"It's very difficult to earn a living here,\" she says, standing beside a tiny home improvised from mud, branches and polythene liners, her modest kitchen having collapsed in the wind. \"There is nothing to do. It's so dry that nothing is growing.</p><p>\"Life was much better in my old village even if you didn't have a job. There was more rain so you could always find work on a farm. You never went hungry. The way we eat here is sporadic: sometimes we don't have breakfast.\"</p><p>Nseri cannot afford the 900 shillings (£6.90) for her daughter's exams at the end of primary school. Two other daughters have been forced to drop out of school because of fees. Election time still fills her with dread.</p><p>\"We are really afraid,\" she adds. \"We don't know what could happen. We will vote but we are worried the same thing could happen again. It's a precarious situation. Some people living in the interior are moving out to where they feel safe. We're not sure. Anything could happen.\"</p><p>Nearby, in baseball cap and torn shirt, is David Kamau, who life has been turned upside down by election violence for 20 years. Whereas he used to own eight acres of land, now he has only one eighth of an acre. \"It's a hard life,\" he muses. \"When the sun shines we have snakes getting into the tents. When it rains, the tents are washed away. The wind tears open the roofing.\"</p><p>Mwai, Nseri and Kamau are all ethnic Kikuyu - and all intend to vote for Uhuru Kenyatta, a Kikuyu running for president. They credit him with saving them from ethnic Kalenjin militias last time. Land ownership has been a longstanding grudge between the Kikuyu and Kalenjin communities. For this election, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/04/kenya-election-alliance-rival\" title=\"\">Kenyatta has formed a pact with William Ruto</a>, a prominent Kalenjin, raising hopes of peace in the Rift Valley at least.</p><p>But both <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/23/kenya-trial-international-criminal-court\" title=\"\">Kenyatta and Ruto are facing ICC charges for orchestrating that violence</a>. They stand accused of involvement in murder, forcible deportation, persecution and rape. Among Kikuyu voters in the Rift Valley, it appears that the charges have actually made Kenyatta stronger, with many saying they want to defend him from a meddling foreign court.</p><p>Victory for the wealthy, smooth-talking deputy prime minister would make him the second president in Africa to be indicted by the ICC after Sudan's Omar al-Bashir. It is feared that Kenya will go from cosy western ally to sanctioned pariah state. Kenyatta's principal rival, Raila Odinga, observed dryly that it would not be possible for him to run a \"government by Skype\" while he stands trial in the Hague.</p><p>The two men are refighting their fathers' old battles. Jomo Kenyatta was Kenya's first president while Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, an ethnic Luo, was vice-president until their relationship soured. This year promises another chapter in the rift between Kikuyus and Luos, for example in Mathare, a slum in the capital, Nairobi.</p><p>Not all Kenyans, however, believe they are prisoners of tribalism condemned to repeat the past. Ngunjiri Wambugu is convenor of Kikuyus for Change and a political adviser to Odinga, not Kenyatta. He says members of the group are working for various candidates cutting across tribal lines. \"If you are Kikuyu you would not automatically be a supporter of Uhuru Kenyatta,\" he says.</p><p>\"This is a turnkey election. We have two forces at play: a past based on tribalism and a future that is about issues and ideas. Our generation of young middle class people are speaking across politics, which was not happening in 2007. By the next election ethnic identity will be a lot less important. There is a new generation of leaders and many of us do not have that tribal ideology.\"</p><p>There are other grounds for optimism after years of introspection. Kenya has a new constitution and a stronger electoral commission and judicial system with a widely admired chief justice. Civil society groups have promoted non-violence and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/31/kenyan-web-monitors-election-violence\" title=\"\">moved to clamp down on hate speech in social media</a>. The outside world is paying unprecedented attention, pouring in more than $100m (£66m), and the ICC could now be a deterrent. The candidates held a joint prayer rally and are preaching peace, in public at least.</p><p>One initiative by Unicef, the UN children's agency, after the last election has led to the formation of a professional football club. Training at Nairobi School, defender John Kiarie, 17, who witnessed people being killed with axes and machetes in his home village, says: \"The team was started from different areas and different tribes. Tribalism is not an issue. We love each other. We are like brothers here.\"</p><p>But if, as predicted, the contest is so close that Odinga and Kenyatta are forced into a run-off next month, sparks may fly in the ethnic tinderbox.</p><p>\"We can't remove the fact that the politics of this country were based on ethnic foundations,\" says George Morara, senior programme officer at the Human Rights Commission. \"The districts were zoned around ethnicities. People learned to associate their ethnic identity with political representation.</p><p>\"You can't move away from that thinking. You grow up in your small ethnic bantustan and think the other people are wild animals you should not meet or interact with. People vividly see that you have to be in power to participate.\"</p><p>A well-educated nation where the middle class can take cookery classes or eat at Italian delicatessens, and where the likes of Google and Nokia are part of an African \"silicon valley\", could be about to discover how thin the veneer of affluence really is. The economy took a big hit from the mayhem last time, with growth <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/jan/18/kenya-election-tension-bullish-economy\" title=\"\">dropping from 7.1% in 2007 to 1.6% the following year</a>.</p><p>Sitting in an upmarket restaurant decorated by African art, Ndungi Githuku, 40, a human rights activist and artist, reflects: \"Kenya is a strange place. It is beautiful in a very bitter way. The contradictions are very hard to explain. Kenya does not give you any warning signs of what you're going to see next. When you're driving in the leafy areas it's orderly, then suddenly you're in a sprawling ghetto. It's like being blindfolded then suddenly you're in a completely different place.</p><p>\"The majority of people working here will return to the slums where there's no water or electricity this evening. You come and cook good food at a restaurant for 5,000 shillings [£39] a plate but your single room home is 5,000 shillings a month and your salary is threadbare.\"</p><p>He adds: \"The most disgusting thing to me is that we are the ones who vote the same people back. Can we not think otherwise? We go with the devil we know. Then when blood is spilled, it happens in the slums. In the leafy suburbs, life goes on.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/1/1362156817588/Displaced-Kenyan-people-s-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/01/kenya-elections-ethnic-tension","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/mar/01/kenya-elections-ethnic-tension","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"In Kenya's election, jobs are the most pressing issue for young people | Andrew Green","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-25T15:49:09Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2013/feb/25/kenya-election-jobs-young-people","fields":{"body":"<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-404387464\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/2/20/130220KenyaPeterMuyaMathare-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/2/20/130220KenyaPeterMuyaMathare-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/2/20/130220KenyaPeterMuyaMathare_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/130220KenyaPeterMuyaMathare/130220KenyaPeterMuyaMathare.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/2/20/130220KenyaPeterMuyaMathare_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>Thanks to the Kenyan presidential election, Wilson Omondi finally has steady work. The 25-year-old scours the internet every morning to find out where prime minister Raila Odinga, one of the frontrunners in the race, will be that day. Then he packs a bag full of Odinga-branded paraphernalia he has had made and hops on a bus.</p><p>He'll spend the day walking around the crowd, selling baseball caps, T-shirts and posters. On a good day, he says, he makes about £20.</p><p>Omondi gave his support to Odinga because of the candidate's promise to deliver free primary and secondary education. It is an important issue to the young entrepreneur – he had to drop out of school a year before graduating because his family could not afford the fees. If Odinga wins on 4 March, Omondi says he will finish school so he can get a better job than selling T-shirts championing presidential hopefuls.</p><p>He is not the only young person closely following what the eight presidential candidates are saying during this campaign.

That translates into more than 1.8 million unemployed young people. Depending on how many turn up at the polls, they could represent a sizeable bloc in a country with 14.3 million registered voters. Their opinion looms large in an election that is too close to call.</p><p>Youth unemployment is \"the most pressing issue for young people in this election\", says Range Mwita, a programme assistant in the youth division at the <a href=\"http://www.cmd-kenya.org/index.php/youth-in-politics/latest-news\" title=\"\">Centre for Multiparty Democracy</a> (CMD). \"That is the issue.\"</p><p>The candidates know it. Most acknowledge youth unemployment in their manifestos and on their websites. Odinga has plastered the country's major cities with a picture of himself smiling, hovering over the word \"jobs\". Uhuru Kenyatta, who is in a close race with Odinga for the lead in most polls, <a href=\"http://www.mwakilishi.com/content/articles/2013/02/03/viewdownload-the-full-harmonized-jubilee-coalition-manifesto.html\" title=\"\">is promising to create 1m jobs for young people in his first two years in office</a>.</p><p>There are also attempts to diagnose and fix the problems causing youth unemployment. Promises have been made to make primary and secondary education free – with no charges for books or uniforms. Candidates also promise to create a more diversified economy that is less dependent on agriculture, so that there will be jobs in a range of industries for young people who flock from their rural homes to urban centres – or, at the very least, opportunities for young people to start building those industries.</p><p>There has been much talk about the <a href=\"http://www.youthfund.go.ke\" title=\"\">youth enterprise development fund</a>. Conceived seven years ago as the government's \"main remedy\" for youth unemployment, the fund has distributed almost £45m in grants to help young people start businesses and organise <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/nov/08/maker-faire-africa-nigeria-innovators\" title=\"\">trade fairs</a>. Odinga has promised to increase the amount going to the fund and Kenyatta is committed to launching a similar initiative.</p><p>One of the goals of the CMD's youth programme is to monitor what the candidates are promising on the campaign trail and in their manifestos, and measure their viability. Although it is reasonable to expand the development fund, Mwita says, Kenyatta's promise to put technology centres in every ward, for example, \"might not be doable\". The CMD then communicates its views to potential voters, to help inform their decisions.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-406747012'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/2/22/1361543705106/MDG-Kenya-youth-001.jpg' alt='MDG Kenya youth' width='140' height='220' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A young supporter of Raila Odinga stands in the crowd at a rally in Bomet town, in Western Kenya.

According to Juniper Research, the market for mobile payments is expected to reach more than $600bn (£393bn) globally this year – double the figure of February 2011. And many development organisations are riding that telecom wave to reach people who don't have access to financial institutions. </p><p>But that doesn't mean mobile banking is without its challenges. DAI's mobile banking and inclusive economic growth specialist <a href=\"http://dai.tc/YdgujM\"rel=\"nofollow\">Brigit Helms</a> has worked for 25 years with various institutions, including McKinsey &amp; Co. and the International Finance Corporation, on financial inclusion and enterprise and market-based approaches to alleviating to poverty. She currently works in Mozambique for the US Agency for International Development (USAid) on a DAI-led project aimed at speeding up the modernisation of Mozambique's economic, legal, and governance systems.</p><p>We recently asked Brigit to discuss some of the barriers in delivering mobile banking solutions to the \"unbanked\" and the benefits.</p><p><strong>What is the fundamental advantage of being 'banked' at all?</strong></p><p>Unbanked people already use financial services – lots of them, in fact.  However, these financial services are all informal: moneylenders, informal savings groups, savings in the form of animals or jewelry, supplier credit, etc. When a factory worker needs to send money to his or her relatives in a remote village, often the only option is to put the money on a bus and hope it arrives. These options are convenient, but also fundamentally insecure, unpredictable, and often costly.  </p><p>Low-income people are particularly vulnerable to shocks, like a death of an income-earner or a hurricane that wipes out crops. In many ways, they need financial services even more than higher-income people - that's why they already use those informal services. Access to more formal financial services enables people to take control of their financial lives and benefit from more predictable, stable, secure and relatively low-cost services. By being \"banked\", people can better plan for the future, save to send their children to school, invest in their businesses, and protect themselves against unexpected crises.</p><p><strong>And what is the added value of mobile banking?</strong></p><p>The main reason why banks do not serve the majority of people in developing countries is because it simply costs too much. Low-income people transact in very small amounts and often live and work in remote or hard-to-reach places. The transactions costs are simply too high for banks to set up branches or even ATM machines in many locales. The mobile value-add is in reducing these costs dramatically. With more than 4b mobile phones on the planet - most of them in developing countries - nearly everyone has the potential to transact. This is very powerful. Even illiterate people are often numerate and already understand how to use the phone for this purpose.</p><p><strong>If end users come from a country where institutions such as banks have not been historically trustworthy, how do you create a level of trust that convinces them to try mobile banking?</strong></p><p>This is a good question. It's difficult to create trust. It takes a concerted effort on the part of the mobile money provider. In some countries, the mobile operators enjoy a higher level of trust than banks, and when mobile operators drive mobile money, that trust might help.</p><p>However, the most important tool for building trust is to invest in extensive client education. For instance, Safaricom, the operator that runs M-PESA in Kenya, spent an enormous amount of time and energy educating customers about how to use the mobile money system.</p><p><strong>In a <a href=\"http://csi.mckinsey.com/knowledge_by_topic/telecoms/mobile_money_in_emerging_markets\"rel=\"nofollow\">McKinsey report</a> you co-authored, you said one of the keys to success in mobile banking was for the financial institution to closely manage its relationships with its network agents. Why is that? Exactly how closely? How sustainable is that for the institution?</strong></p><p>Mobile money works because it enables the service provider to get very close to customers. They do this through agents. Agents can be neighbourhood shops, petrol stations, even lottery ticket sellers. These agents are the \"face\" of the business and determine customers' trust and willingness to transact over the mobile platform.</p><p>For the business model to work, agents need to see the benefit of buying and selling electronic money. This means that the provider cannot build out the agent network too fast or too slowly. For instance, if the agent network grows too quickly, you have hundreds or even thousands of agents out there with no customers transacting.  This means that there is no incentive for the agent to make sure (s)he has enough electronic money to sell (cash-in), or cash with which to buy back electronic money (cash-out).  </p><p>When eventually a customer comes and wants to either cash-in or cash-out, the agent is not prepared, has forgotten his training, and ultimately the system loses credibility. This has happened in several countries, for instance in West Africa. On the other hand, if there are not sufficient agents, customers will not buy electronic money and use it because they don't see the benefit - no agents in sight!</p><p>It is costly to build and manage the agent network, but these costs are worth incurring in order to get to scale and they will eventually pay off - as some of the more successful mobile money experiments are showing.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/31/us-africa-telecoms-idUSBRE90U0MK20130131\"rel=\"nofollow\">Recent reports</a> show that mobile penetration in Africa is much lower than previously thought, with urban populations owning multiple Sim cards and rural populations still unable to connect, likely leaving those same populations without access to mobile banking. How can the development community incentivise African telecoms to invest in rural expansion?</strong></p><p>Incentivising African telecoms to invest in rural expansion is a key problem. I live in Mozambique where this phenomenon is definitely present. There is a new instrument increasingly used to engage with the private sector in development called \"pull mechanisms.\" Pull mechanisms are ex-post subsidies that offer prizes to companies after they have achieved certain results. The Haiti Mobile Money Initiative, a partnership between the Gates Foundation and USAid, is a great example. The initiative will award a total of $4m to the first and second operators to launch mobile money services in Haiti, and a further $6m will be distributed to participating mobile operators once 5 million mobile money transactions have happened. Perhaps something like this could spur more operators and banks into action. Another option is the challenge fund concept. The Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund is an example of a programme that spurs innovation by the private sector. </p><p><strong>Some critics say poor people will often skip buying food to buy mobile minutes. Does our support of mobile banking contribute to that behaviour?</strong></p><p>In my experience across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, I have seen firsthand the spread of mobile phones as incredibly empowering. Mobile phones have made most people's lives so much easier, enabling them access to information and opportunities they need in real time. I've seen it literally save lives, for instance, when someone is sick, cutting the time in half or more to alert an ambulance and get that person to a hospital. As with many technology advances, I'm sure there can be abuses or misbehaviour. But I believe poor people are poor, not stupid, and we need to trust that when people buy phones and use them to make their lives easier, they know much better what's best for them than we do.<br /><em><strong><br />Content on this page is produced and controlled by DAI</strong></em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/21/1361439109866/girls-looking-at-phone-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/dai-partner-zone/benefits-of-bringing-mobile-banking-to-the-unbanked","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/dai-partner-zone/benefits-of-bringing-mobile-banking-to-the-unbanked","sectionName":"DAI partner zone"},{"webTitle":"Beneficiaries-led development: can assistance be crowdsourced?

India's the sort of place where, if you love it immediately, things will fall into place.\"</p><p>Perhaps this explains why the country's bustle seems to be back. With strong inward investment (Ikea recently became the first major foreign retailer to enter the subcontinent, with plans to open 25 stores, while Pizza Express has also opened franchises), India is back to its best. </p><p>The country has the 11th-largest world economy by GDP and the Association of Executive Search Consultants has found growing numbers of expats putting India as their preferred destination. Recruiters in India have reported a 20% rise in expats applying for jobs – no doubt because of the country's solid growth predictions: in 2013, the Indian economy is forecast to grow by 6%, creating 1.3m jobs. </p><p>But the life India can offer also seems to be a deciding factor. Research by HSBC Expat has found that 83% of expats say their disposable incomes are higher in India than before their posting, while the mainly young population of mobile workers will find like minds in India, where half of the population is under 25.</p><p>IT has historically been the big sector for expat opportunities (particularly in Bangalore), but others are catching up fast: the fast-moving consumable goods sector (supermarket goods, including food and toiletries), is predicted to grow at 5.3% this year, creating 176,900 jobs; retail 10.5% (102,800); hospitality 3.4% (106,300); and banking and finance 8.1% (72,900).</p><h2>The key to urban areas</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-405836245'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/commercial/2013/2/19/1361267562043/HSBC-Bangalore-001.jpg' alt='HSBC: Bangalore' width='220' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Not only is Bangalore considered the \"Silicon Valley of India\", but it is also home to the largest number of pubs in the country.

The cuisine is said to change every 24 miles and India has a further five cities with populations of more than 5 million – and 10 more with between 2 and 3 million people. </p><p>\"Many of these new cities have skills gaps to be filled,\" says Adrian Mutton of Delhi-based Sannam S4, which has helped 75 companies move into India in the past two years. \"Pune [in the state of Maharashtra, near Mumbai] is now a major entity in its own right, especially in car production,\" he says. </p><p>Carol Stubbings, head of international mobility for PwC,  highlights another city that has undergone a rapid expansion over the past 25 years: Gurgaon. One of Delhi's four satellite cities, Gurgaon is part of the National Capital Region, has the third-highest per capita income in India and it's growing fast.</p><p>Other cities that expats will soon be hearing about are Chennai (predicted to have 12.8 million people by 2025), Hyderabad, in the south-eastern state of Andhra Pradesh, and Jaipur, India's first planned city, in the north-west. </p><p>Those with the verve to relocate to these emerging, exciting cities should act fast, however. People now need to earn $25,000 (£16,000) a year to be considered for employment visas and expats could soon be competing with returning Indians who left during the 1990s \"brain drain\". </p><p>The companies bill (passed in December 2012) will bring more Indian businesses under European standards (such as an April-March tax year), so opportunities need to be taken now. </p><p>\"India is learning fast – and it won't take long for the skills transfer they need to be complete,\" says Tony Goodwin, CEO of global executive recruitment firm Antal International. \"There's a window of around 10 years. Until then, moving to India will be a great experience. It'll be a shock, but you definitely won't regret it.\"</p><p>And for those who see this as simply meaning decade's worth of strong development and internal growth though, that's more than long enough.

Globalisation and technology have brought about huge changes in the way businesses operate. Communication is faster than ever. Finance is more mobile than ever. And the value of companies is increasingly tied up in concepts such as brand and intellectual property, which do not observe country borders.</p><p>Despite this, the principles governing tax for multinational companies have barely changed since they were developed by the League of Nations almost a century ago. As a result, some large multinationals are able to restructure their business to avoid paying their fair share in tax. Some are exploiting the rules by getting profits out of high tax countries and into tax havens, allowing them to pay as little as 5% in corporate taxes while smaller businesses are paying up to 30%. This distorts competition, giving larger companies an advantage over smaller domestic companies. People are rightly asking for something to be done.</p><p>I want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business and to attract global companies, with all the jobs they bring. That's why we're cutting the corporation tax rate from 28% to 21% – the lowest in the G7. But I am also clear that global companies should pay those taxes.</p><p>The last Labour government turned a blind eye to these abuses for too long. Britain had the worst of all worlds – uncompetitive tax rates with lax enforcement. Responsible companies were penalised and the irresponsible were rewarded. This government is taking action domestically on avoidance and evasion. Prosecutions for tax evasion are up 80%; we're introducing the first ever <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/tax_avoidance_gaar.htm\" title=\"\">General Anti-Abuse Rule</a> and as a result of this government's investment we expect to raise £22bn more a year from evasion and avoidance by the end of the parliament. But acting alone has its limits. Clamp down too hard in one country and it is all too easy for those companies to move elsewhere.</p><p>In November, I joined my German and French counterparts to call for co-ordinated action to strengthen the international corporate tax rules and we asked the OECD to help us do it. They presented their findings to the G20 this weekend and will now prepare a plan of action which – if agreed – will be put to the G20 in July.</p><p>We're taking action through the G20. But the problem goes much wider than the 20 major economies it represents. Last week, the <em>Observer </em>launched a debate over the specific problem of tax avoidance in developing companies. You are right to highlight this: often the poorer a nation is, the more it needs the tax revenues, but also the weaker its capacity to tackle tax avoidance.</p><p>That's why the British government is providing support, as part of our wider commitment to overseas aid. Next year, we will have met the international commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI on overseas aid, the first country in the G20 to meet it.It's a proud moment for me as a Conservative. We have not turned our backs on the poorest countries in these tough times.</p><p>Our investment means 11 million children will go to school,  55 million children will be vaccinated against preventable diseases and we will stop 250,000 babies dying needlessly. But it will also help developing countries to govern effectively – and tax collection is a crucial part of that.  Our work in Ethiopia has helped to strengthen the efficiency of revenue collection; since we came into office, tax collection in Ethiopia has increased by 40%. This is just one example – we are also involved in projects in Kenya, Ghana, Uganda and Tanzania.</p><p>But there is scope to go further. This year, the UK hosts the meeting of G8 leaders. We are determined to use our presidency to drive a serious debate on tax evasion and tax avoidance. This will include action to help developing countries collect tax that is due to them. And we will champion a new agenda of transparency and accountability in developing countries. With the authority that comes from meeting our international commitments on aid, Britain is well placed to tackle the causes, not just the symptoms of poverty, such as corruption and lack of transparency.</p><p>As part of this work, we are clear that the developed world must lead by example. Britain is leading efforts in the EU to require oil, gas and mining companies to publish key financial information for each country and project they work on, and is a strong supporter of the <a href=\"http://eiti.org/extractive-industries-transparency-initiative\" title=\"\">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</a>. We will use the G8 to drive greater transparency, to ensure that revenues from these sectors can help developing countries forge a path to sustainable growth, instead of fuelling conflict and corruption. Professor Paul Collier, a leading development economist, is working with us to consider how through the G8, under Britain's leadership, we can make the biggest difference.</p><p>This year, we have an opportunity to turn concern over tax avoidance into a catalyst for change; creating a competitive tax system that supports businesses, but where everyone pays their fair share. Through our role in the G20 and our leadership of the G8, we can ensure this change benefits Britain's taxpayers and also helps meet our commitments to the poorest in our society.</p><p><em>George Osborne is chancellor of the exchequer</em></p><p>• <em>Comments will be opened on Sunday morning</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/2/16/1361009639591/St-Basil-s-Cathedral-Red--005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/16/george-osborne-on-his-tax-reform-agenda","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/16/george-osborne-on-his-tax-reform-agenda","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Scientists in Mexico herald agriculture revolution in food security push","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-15T13:19:50Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2013/feb/15/scientists-mexico-agriculture-revolution-food-security","fields":{"body":"<p>Scientists at a major international research centre based in Mexico say recent donations from billionaire philanthropists have taken them significantly closer to providing poor farmers with more productive, nutritional and resistant varieties of wheat and maize at a critical time.</p><p></p><p>\"We believe that we are witnessing the start of a genuine new agricultural revolution that will provide food security for generations to come,\" Thomas Lumpkin, director of the <a href=\"http://www.cimmyt.org/\" title=\"\">International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre</a>, said at this week's inauguration of facilities funded by a $25m (£16.1m) donation from Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim, the world's richest person.</p><p></p><p>Lumpkin said the new laboratories and greenhouses would double research capacity at the centre, known by its Spanish abbreviation CIMMYT. The centre, famous for launching the \"<a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/publication/asian-green-revolution\" title=\"\">Green Revolution</a>\" in Mexico and south Asia in the 1960s, is located just outside Mexico City.</p><p></p><p>Lumpkin and Slim were joined at the ceremony by Bill Gates, No 2 on the global rich list, whose contributions reputedly saved the centre from going under a decade ago.</p><p></p><p>All of them stressed that a perfect storm of rising demand for basic grains, dwindling resources, new pests and the additional pressures expected from climate change could have catastrophic impacts in many parts of the world if small-scale farmers are not given affordable access to new varieties that can better cope with these challenges.</p><p></p><p>Interviewed after the event, Lumpkin said the biggest potential for doing this comes from applying technology developed in human genetic research to germ plasm. He said CIMMYT is at the vanguard of these efforts because of its massive gene banks storing 28,000 varieties of maize and 120,000 varieties of wheat.</p><p></p><p>\"Before you were dealing with shadows and vague things off in the distance, but now we have a sharp focus and can see much more,\" Lumpkin said of the difference between the old methods of hybridisation and the new possibilities for precision picking and mixing of desired traits.</p><p></p><p>CIMMYT plans to make the information from its research easily available and understandable to breeders around the world so that they can use it to develop their own varieties specifically designed to address local problems.</p><p></p><p>More controversially, CIMMYT's revamped facilities are designed to increase the centre's capacity for transgenic research. While insisting that transgenics will remain a relatively minor part of the Mexico programme, probably reaching about 10% in the next five years, Lumpkin argues it could prove critical where manipulation of natural diversity proves insufficient.</p><p></p><p>CIMMYT scientists say it is particularly important, for example, to find ways of increasing heat tolerance in wheat varieties used in <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21469804~menuPK:2246552~pagePK:2865106~piPK:2865128~theSitePK:223547,00.html\" title=\"\">south Asia</a>, where demand is booming and temperatures are predicted to rise dramatically in the next decade.</p><p></p><p>Lumpkin claims that when delivered by non-profit organisations such as CIMMYT,  genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can help tackle rural inequality by spreading technology that is currently largely limited to the developed world.</p><p></p><p>CIMMYT is already working with experimental GMO maize crops in Kenya and several other African countries using \"tried and tested\" traits provided for free by multinational companies under special agreements. Lumpkin says companies such as Monsanto are willing to do this when the varieties produced are designed for markets that are not commercially significant.</p><p></p><p>In Mexico, CIMMYT's GM research is limited to wheat, but the new facilities open the possibility of expanding this to much more controversial research with maize.</p><p></p><p>Mexico is a centre of origin of the crop and the country is home to a vibrant anti-transgenic movement rooted in concerns about contamination of local varieties, deep distrust of official guarantees of safety, and suspicion of the motives of proponents of these technologies.</p><p></p><p>Campaigners are trying to prevent the Mexican government authorising big commercial projects on GM maize, following a period of several years of experimental and pilot schemes they say have not been properly monitored.</p><p></p><p>\"They talk about transgenics as the solution to world hunger and inequality but it is a false solution,\" said Greenpeace Mexico's spokesman on agriculture, Aleira Lara. \"Even if it is altruistic there are risks. What we need is for the state to attend to the real problems. We need more state budgets to do things such as invest in improving irrigation systems.\"</p><p></p><p>CIMMYT scientists, and their billionaire backers, are careful to express their respect for Mexican sensitivities about maize, but are also committed to the idea that the potential benefits out way the risks.</p><p></p><p>At the ceremony in Mexico on Wednesday, Gates said there were \"legitimate issues, but solvable issues\" around GM and lauded CIMMYT's role trying to sidestep concerns about monopolisation of the technology by the multinationals. His foundation dedicates about 8% of its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jul/06/sam-dryden-global-south-agriculture\" title=\"\">agricultural budget</a> to GM-associated projects.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/2/15/1360929041567/MDG-Bill-Gates-and-Carlos-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/feb/15/scientists-mexico-agriculture-revolution-food-security","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/feb/15/scientists-mexico-agriculture-revolution-food-security","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Listen to poor people; don't just hand out the cash | Maxine Molyneux","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-15T07:00:30Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2013/feb/15/listen-poor-people-cash-transfers","fields":{"body":"<p>We already know a fair amount about the ways poor people and their communities benefit from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/katine-chronicles-blog/2010/jun/29/just-give-money-cash-transfers\" title=\"\">cash transfers</a>, but we know far less about what poor people themselves think about these programmes: what they particularly value, what they think could be improved, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/may/09/report-questions-if-cash-transfers-help-women\" title=\"\">how the programmes could work better</a>.</p><p></p><p>In a climate of austerity, with growing concern over aid effectiveness and value for money, donors and governments are increasingly recognising the value of poor communities participating in the monitoring and evaluation of social protection programmes. Who better to ask than those affected by such programmes?</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://transformingcashtransfers.org/\" title=\"\">Research by the Overseas Development Institute</a> into beneficiary and community perceptions of cash transfers paints a varied picture. Across Kenya, Uganda, Yemen, Mozambique and Palestine, the effects of cash transfers have been overwhelmingly positive. However, there are practical challenges.</p><p></p><p>Although any money is greatly appreciated, the amount of money given is often too little to meet the basic daily needs of the recipient. Gloria (not her real name), an elderly woman with a disability from Chibuto in Mozambique, receives just over 100 meticais (£2.90) a month. \"What do you think I can do with 100 meticais?\" she says. \"I can hardly buy anything. But as it is something that is given as a gift you just have to be grateful.\"</p><p></p><p>Long waiting times and endless queues are the norm for people collecting cash. In Gaza, the tension caused by the long wait sometimes descends into clashes in the street. One 45-year-old widow from Rafah recounts: \"I went to collect my payment slip but there was a queue and it took me three hours to get it. Staff were sitting in a comfortable office, and us women and the elderly had to wait in the sun.\"</p><p></p><p>Poor targeting of cash transfers can be a problem and is seen as particularly unjust where people who are less poor benefit while extremely poor people remain on waiting lists or are unaware of their eligibility. In Kenya, many people living in poverty couldn't understand why they weren't receiving any money while others were. In this case, people hadn't realised that they have to apply to be enrolled on the programme.</p><p></p><p>In Uganda, elderly people receiving cash often find it difficult to make a complaint when mistakes happen. Sometimes this is due to technology problems or administrative delays, but often people are reluctant to complain because they fear their benefits will be taken away. One elderly man said those implementing the programme see people who complain as troublemakers.</p><p></p><p>People want and appreciate reliable mechanisms that ensure efficient delivery. If all communities benefiting from these programmes have more say in how they are run, more can be done to reach those in most need and address problems.</p><p></p><p>There is also an ethical argument for giving a voice to poor people and listening to what they have to say; people have a right to a say over what affects them. However, as the poorest and most vulnerable people in society, cash transfer beneficiaries often suffer discrimination based on gender, age, disability, ethnicity, sexuality and religion.</p><p></p><p>The overall evidence shows that poor people appreciate cash transfer programmes, but that they want to improve what the programmes do and how they operate, and to work harder to ensure that they reach those who need them. Most importantly, more needs to be done to provide routes out of poverty so that they can escape dependency on the transfer.</p><p></p><p>It is clear that we need to listen to the people served by these programmes to get a finely grained picture of what's happening on the ground. Giving a voice to poor people is not only the right thing to do, but if they were listened to by governments and donors, we could see more efficient, fair and effective programmes.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/2/13/1360763130544/MDG-Cash-Transfer-in-Yeme-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/feb/15/listen-poor-people-cash-transfers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/feb/15/listen-poor-people-cash-transfers","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Research in brief – 14 February 2013","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-14T18:39:51Z","sectionId":"higher-education-network","id":"higher-education-network/2013/feb/14/research-in-brief-university","fields":{"body":"<h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/socialsciences\" title=\"\"><strong>Social Science </strong></a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-404097554'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/4/1/1301657835710/A-fresh-bunch-of-roses-si-002.jpg' alt='A fresh bunch of roses sits in cold storage at a flower farm in Naivasha, Kenya' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>A dozen red roses may not be as welcome as washing the dishes on Valentine's Day, a <a href=\"http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=25129\" title=\"\">study by the Open University</a> finds – showing simple acts of kindest are key to helping couples stay together.</p><p>New research into consumer choice conducted at <a href=\"http://www.uel.ac.uk/news/press-releases/2013/02/branding.htm\" title=\"\">UEL </a>shows that negative information may have a much smaller effect than previously believed.

It has motivated other pupils at school, particularly when Mike Bremans from Ecover kindly visited the project after we won and gave an inspirational talk to our Year 11 business students. He came to see our workshop, and really got his hands dirty to see B.O.B in action. The kids were amazed that someone would come all the way from Belgium to see them. Winning has also inspired the girls at school to get more involved in design and technology sustainable projects - this year's best B.O.B-ers are all girls!</p><p><strong>What have you gone on to do since winning the award?</strong></p><p>Where do we start? Firstly, the award has meant we can develop our web site and we have now launched a web sales operation. It has also enabled us to branch out into other products - the second generation of B.O.B have incorporated a section for insects, where solitary bees and moths could hibernate, and which provides a sanctuary for another element of the food chain.</p><p>Savy B.O.B has expanded to include younger pupils. Now we invite a group of Year 5 primary school children in to the senior school each year for a six week project. They take the boxes back with them to school afterwards to help improve their own environment.  </p><p>We have also grown to support local conservation projects by donating boxes. Eighteen of our boxes will be going to our local golf course, making it 'bat and bird friendly'!</p><p>Another thing we have done is to increase our tool range so that children with disabilities to get involved as well. Our friends at B&amp;Q supplied light powered hand tools for a Year 8 pupil who didn't have the strength to get fully engaged in the projects. Now she is able to make her own boxes independently, without support.</p><p>Last but not least, we have set up another ethical enterprise project, Mama Margaret's, which works with women in Dagoretti, one of the major slums in Nairobi. They make a range of craft items - key-rings, bracelets, necklaces - which we sell and then send all the proceeds back to them. There are now over 46 Mamas involved, which is fantastic, and they are now making 'bespoke' items for two charities. In two years we have raised over £8,000. On the back of this, enterprise permission was granted for the construction of a skill centre for women - building has started and teacher Steve Burrowes will be going over in the summer armed with 'Kit for Kids in Kenya' donated by kids in Bootle, to give to the kids at Mama's and in the slums.</p><p><strong>What are the future plans for Savy B.O.B?</strong></p><p>Next step - launching the B.O.B box flat pack! We will be working with Bat Conservation colleagues across the UK on dual purpose packaging, wrapping the flat-pack box in a sleeve, using re-cycled paper (of course). We are aiming to work on the aesthetic appeal of packaging for B.O.B to improve sales and marketability, with a design for the reverse side as a 'bat education' poster. ·</p><p><strong>Do you have any advice for other young people who are thinking of entering the awards about what makes a great entry?</strong></p><p>Take a risk. Think 'quirky', and make it fun. You need to have a real impact, and engage a wide age group to have maximum reach. Remember that a small contribution to ethical living could have a bigger impact down the line, on the hearts and minds of future generations. Think acorns and oak trees - it only takes a grain of sand to tip a balanced see-saw!</p><p><strong>What does being 'ethical' mean for you?</strong></p><p>Ethical to us means doing something for the great good - being a little bit selfless, and working together to effect some positive change. We wanted to leave a positive footprint, somewhere, somehow, and we think that winning the Young Green Champions award has helped us to do that.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/observer-ethical-awards/young-green-champions-2011-winners-savy-b-o-b-box","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/observer-ethical-awards/young-green-champions-2011-winners-savy-b-o-b-box","sectionName":"Observer Ethical Awards"},{"webTitle":"Using biometrics in development: lessons and challenges","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-11T11:27:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/11/biometrics-development-aid-work","fields":{"body":"<p>Citizens of rich countries take official identification for granted. But many in poor countries lack robust IDs, or indeed any documentation at all. This \"<a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/protection/BirthReg10a_rev.pdf\" title=\"\">identity gap</a>\" has been an obstacle to inclusive development in many countries. But increasingly, governments and donors have turned to digital fingerprints, iris scans, and other biometrics to provide inclusive, secure and accurate identification for their citizens, from national IDs, to elections and social welfare payments. In a recent Center for Global Development <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1426862/\" title=\"\">working paper</a>, we surveyed 160 cases where biometric identification had been used for such programmes in over 70 developing countries — cases which cover over 1 billion people!</p><p>Unlike paper-based systems, biometrics can reliably ensure uniqueness (have you already registered to vote?), authenticate transactions (are you the owner of this debit card?),  and help create an auditable trail (did you already receive payment this month?).</p><p>Thus, as <a href=\"http://www.africanbusinessreview.co.za/business_leaders/africas-mobile-revolution\" title=\"\">mobile technology</a> has done for communication, biometric identification may allow developing countries to leapfrog past traditional paper-based identity systems.</p><p>But despite this potential, the technology is no guarantee of success. Concerns remain regarding privacy (though biometrics can improve anonymity when used in place of personal information like name, gender or address), cost and implementation. To date, there has been little empirical work on the effectiveness of biometrics for developmental purposes. Companies with proprietary technology have been reluctant to provide performance data. <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1426583/\" title=\"\">India's open standards</a> may change this; its performance reports provide a benchmark for accuracy and inclusion that can be used by other countries. India's Unique ID programme now covers some 240 million people, and has contributed to the rapidly falling costs of the new technology. But many programmes are still in the early stages, and only a few of the 160 cases have had impact studies so far.</p><p>Still, it is possible to distil a number of important lessons and pitfalls from the information that is publicly available for existing biometrics programmes. In our paper, we identify important successes, risks and failures, and discuss the important role that donors — who already fund a majority of the surveyed cases — can play in identification strategies.</p><h2>Examples of successes</h2><p>Biometrics has helped to promote development in certain cases, particularly with regards to increasing efficiency, improving service delivery and accountability, and allowing poorer countries to build sophisticated identification systems in a relatively short period of time. Biometrics can also facilitate inclusion for marginalised groups; a robust identifier can replace the need for extensive documentation (which the poor often lack) in many cases.</p><p>• In <a href=\"http://www.netnewspublisher.com/37000-ghost-pensioners-discovered-in-nigeria/\" title=\"\">Nigeria</a>, introducing biometrics into the federal pension system eliminated nearly 40% of the beneficiary roll. This not only increases efficiency and accountability, but has the potential to improve services (assuming the funds saved are redirected to other services).</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.nec.com/en/case/bolivia/pdf/catalogue.pdf\" title=\"\">Bolivia</a> was able to expand its voter roll to large section of the population previously absent from the political process.</p><p>• South Africa has been using biometric identification and electronic transfers and ATMs to distribute pensions and social grants for over 20 years.</p><p>• In Pakistan, an efficient national identification agency (<a href=\"http://www.nadra.gov.pk/\" title=\"\">NADRA</a>) ensured transparent management of disaster relief funds by ensuring that only those affected by the 2010 floods received reconstruction payments through Visa cards.</p><h2>Risks and challenges</h2><p>In certain cases, projects have failed to deliver due to problems with logistics, incentives and sustainability. In other countries, multiple agencies or donors control inefficient, incompatible systems that can't be integrated or scaled up. People who cannot provide biometrics (eg, those with damaged or missing fingers) may find it difficult to register, and others may be excluded if identification exercises define citizenship in an exclusionary way. Finally, ongoing concerns about privacy remain — though many cases indicate these are less than often assumed — particularly in countries with weak legal safeguards.</p><p>• Voter registration, for example, is a high-stakes activity that must often be done quickly. Though biometrics may seem ideal for providing clean electoral rolls, the hurried timeline can complicate procurement (as recently seen in <a href=\"http://www.biometricupdate.com/201212/kenyans-rush-to-register-biometrics-ahead-of-general-election-though-malfunctions-cause-delays/\" title=\"\">Kenya</a>) and compromise quality.</p><p>• A number of countries have a multitude of IDs, which overlap and cause confusion and waste. In 2006, Nigeria established a <a href=\"http://www.nimc.gov.ng/downloads/Final%20Report.pdf\" title=\"\">committee on harmonisation of national identity cards</a> to address this issue. The committee identified 12 ongoing ID projects at the federal level, eight of which included biometrics.</p><p>• While completing a national identification project to include the undocumented in social protection programmes, the <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/some-stateless-haitians-gain-legal-foothold\" title=\"\">Dominican Republic</a> simultaneously implemented laws that effectively stripped many individuals of Haitian descent of de facto, if not de jure, citizenship. This may be a concern in other countries with migratory populations.</p><h2>Role of donors</h2><p>Donors have played a critical role in the rollout of identity programmes and technology, supporting at least half of the surveyed projects. Though critical, this support is often given without long-term strategies for identity management, resulting in fragmented or duplicate IDs. Beyond continuing to play an important demand-side role in the provision of identification, donors can also help set technology standards and bring together disparate parties and agencies to avoid fragmentation and create economies of scope and scale. Because biometrics make it easy to verify the number of unique enrollments, donors may also consider using <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/codaid\" title=\"\">output-based financing</a> for identification.</p><p>Ultimately, there is no perfect system or approach to identification. What works in one country may not work in others, and what works in one local project may not work on a larger scale. Some countries (and <a href=\"http://www.clarciev.com/cmse/\" title=\"\">regions</a>) have favoured a supply-driven approach, focusing on providing \"foundational\" identification (like <a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2012/11/pakistans-pocket-of-productivity-empowerment-through-identification.php\" title=\"\">civil registries and national IDs</a>) that can be used for many purposes. Others have strengthened identification for a particular service (like elections or social transfers) in response to demand. Like the US social security number, these \"functional\" IDs may later be expanded for other purposes.

They've also got wild animals to contend with – one ranger was recently attacked by a lion. They're outnumbered, and sometimes poachers have night-vision equipment. There aren't enough resources to tackle this in South Africa at the moment. This is where the new technologies come in, to help them.\"</p><p>Drones are already being used by conservationists to monitor wildlife, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/20/ecology-drones-endangered-wildlife\" title=\"\">such as orangutan populations in Sumatra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/01/drones-fight-japanese-whalers\" title=\"\">anti-whaling activists are using them against the Japanese whaling fleet</a>, and a charity in Kenya <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/high-tech-meets-african-rhino?c=home\" title=\"\">recently beat its target of raising $35,000 in crowdfunding</a> for a drone to protect rhinos and other wildlife in the country's Laikipia district. One South African rhino farmer is even planning to put 30 drones in the sky himself. But the way the three key technologies are being used by WWF is \"unprecedented\", Crawford said.</p><p>A pair of drones will be used in each of the two countries selected, which the group hopes to name within weeks, with plans to ultimately be operational in four sites by 2015, with different terrains. Crawford said the software and drones, which would be operated by rangers or local law enforcement, would \"generate a strategic deployment of rangers in the most cost effective way, so they can form a shield between animals and poachers.\"</p><p>The drones would likely cost in the tens of thousands of dollars rather than hundreds of thousands, he said, adding that \"if governments wanted to, they could deploy [more expensive] high altitude drones that can stay up high in the sky, and track poachers to get the middle men and whole trade line.\" The funding for WWF's project <a href=\"http://worldwildlife.org/stories/google-helps-wwf-stop-wildlife-crime\" title=\"\">comes from a Google grant awarded last December</a>.</p><p>\"We've got to crack this problem because it's getting out of control,\" Crawford said. \"The poachers seem to have figured out how to get round existing anti-poaching methods.\" But he admitted anti-poaching efforts could get caught up in an arms race, and that it was a \"risk\" that poachers may get their own drones. \"It will be an escalation like that until we change the cause, which is demand in Asia.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/2/6/1360158964012/Drone-to-fight-illegal-wi-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/07/wwf-wildlife-drones-illegal-trade","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/feb/07/wwf-wildlife-drones-illegal-trade","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Kenyan web monitors work to avert election violence","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-31T17:57:09Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2013/jan/31/kenyan-web-monitors-election-violence","fields":{"body":"<p>In the corner of a light, airy room in Nairobi, three young Kenyans are staring at computer screens, quietly scrolling through thousands of blogs, tweets and comments, searching for hate speech before the Kenyan general election.</p><p>Amid fears that the vote will descend into the kind of violence that followed the election in 2007, when at least 1,200 people were killed, a research project has been launched to monitor the way political issues are discussed online.</p><p>\"We have come across some very serious comments – some being calls to kill, to forcibly evict, to steal or to beat,\" said Kagonya Awori of iHub Research, who has run the <a href=\"http://www.ihub.co.ke/blog/tag/umati/\" title=\"\">Umati</a> project since its launch last September. \"The question that worries me is: are they just talking, or do they have the mettle to do what they are talking about? Because if they do … then we should be worried.\"</p><p>The Umati project was set up at Nairobi's technology innovation centre, the <a href=\"http://www.ihub.co.ke/pages/home.php\" title=\"\">iHub</a>, in conjunction with <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a>, a non-profit, open-source information platform that grew out of the 2007-08 violence and has since been used in disasters from Haiti to Japan.</p><p>With only weeks to go before Kenyans choose a new leader on 4 March, Angela Crandall, who runs the Umati project with Awori, said the aim was \"to hold a thermometer to the online space\".</p><p>Five monitors look for three categories of speech: offensive, moderately dangerous and extremely dangerous. The five are from different tribes and search sites in their own languages: Kikuyu, Luo, Luhya, and Kalenjin, with a fifth person looking in Kiswahili and Sheng, a street slang drawn from Swahili and English. A Somali speaker is being hired: Kenya has a large community of Somali refugees as well as Somali Kenyans, and tensions have been rising, partly because of Kenya's involvement in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/17/somalia-kenya-al-shabaab-uganda\" title=\"\">war against Islamists in neighbouring Somalia</a>, and subsequent grenade attacks in Kenya.</p><p>The team has found most hate speech on Facebook or in blog comments, with users using the basest of stereotypes when talking about politics. \"One of our most interesting findings is that most of those who spread hate speech are identifiable,\" said Awori. \"Moreover, their conversations target particular communities, political and social groups.\"</p><p>Awori was surprised at the level of \"extremely dangerous\" speech, saying she had assumed that a higher level of education among mainly urban internet users would mean they would be more responsible online. About 36% of Kenyans have access to the internet and most use their mobile phones to get online.</p><p>Examples of \"extremely dangerous speech\" are reported to <a href=\"http://uchaguzi.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Uchaguzi</a>, a technology platform mapping hate speech and other intimidation.

Photograph: Clar Ni Chonghaile for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>There is much to understand. In Dadaab, 448,000 refugees, mostly from Somalia, live in five giant camps in a sweltering, scrub-covered expanse of sand. Some camps have winding streets and trees, while the newest feature rows of tents <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/02/somalia-famine-dadaab-refugee-extension\" title=\"\">housing people who fled Somalia's famine in 2011</a>.</p><p>The idea of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/15/kenya-kenyatta-university-somali-refugees-dadaab\" title=\"\">opening a university campus here</a> is audacious – this corner of Kenya, just 90km (55 miles) from the border with Somalia, has been hit hard by years of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/jan/25/insecurity-dadaab-refugees-kenya-somali\" title=\"\">war against the Islamic insurgents of al-Shabaab</a>.</p><p>Improvised explosive devices have targeted police patrols in the camps, aid workers have been kidnapped, and several elders and community leaders have been shot. Foreign visitors must take a police escort to visit the site, and aid workers' movements are restricted. Kenyan security forces have also been accused of abuses in the camps, after bomb attacks against them.</p><p>Noor Hassan wants to improve his skills so that when he goes home he can compete with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/jan/11/mogadishu-manhattan-somalis-return-progress\" title=\"\">Somali returnees from the US and Europe</a>. He has applied to study public policy and administration at the new campus and although the fee of 100,000 shillings (£730) a year is high, he hopes he can raise it through savings and from friends living abroad.</p><p>The UN refugee agency, <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home\" title=\"\">UNHCR</a>, is seeking partners to provide scholarships to the new campus.</p><p>\"If I finish, I will move to Somalia and take the risk, because no pain, no gain. If I stay here, I will be wasting my energy and my youth,\" Noor Hassan says. \"Let me have four more years of difficulty, then I can go there.\"</p><p>Marangu Njogu, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.windle.org/\" title=\"\">Windle Trust</a>, helped mobilise support for the Dadaab campus. Known as \"the father of education\" in Dadaab, he is a key player in the <a href=\"http://crs.yorku.ca/bher\" title=\"\">Borderless Higher Education for Refugees</a> (Bher) project, a partnership between Canadian and Kenyan institutions aimed at improving education opportunities for refugees and marginalised local communities.</p><p>The Kenyatta University campus will \"act as a launchpad [for Bher] to provide education for the refugees\", he says, arguing that education is as essential as emergency services. \"When people look at refugees coming, and say, 'We can't do education because it's an emergency', it's a disservice to the people … Education is the most critical element in helping human beings to develop and be self-reliant,\" he says.</p><p>\"We should provide education immediately, give people skills to be able to be in charge of their lives, and give them opportunities to interact with other people instead of just bundling them together,\" Njogu says, adding that education also prevents young people from engaging in \"antisocial activities\".</p><p>Programme development manager Tom Oindo says Windle Trust aims to improve life in the camps but also to prepare people for returning home. The organisation places a special emphasis on enabling girls to further their education. \"We try to give a transformative education to ensure that we are actually equipping our scholars with skills to be able to contribute to the development of their home countries but, at the same time, have requisite skills to survive within the current situation.\"</p><p>This idea underlies the Bher programme, which will provide a wide range of courses to refugees through a mix of online and on site resources, says Professor Wenona Giles of York University in Toronto, <a href=\"http://crs.yorku.ca/bher-dadaab-team\" title=\"\">one of Bher's lead partners</a>.</p><p>Bher will not charge tuition fees, but will need contributions to cover direct costs. The consortium – including York University, Kenyatta University, the University of British Columbia and Kenya's Moi University – wants to set up a fund to help refugees with transport, food and other expenses.</p><p>\"This is a pilot project from which we can learn in order to do this in other sites,\" says Giles. \"Education is a right. And higher education should be a right. We're looking at [using] phones, radios, MP3 players. We are going to use everything we can.\" The Bher project will also have a learning centre on the Dadaab campus.</p><p>Technology is key to another education initiative in Dadaab: a joint project between <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/UNHCRInnovate\" title=\"\">UNHCR's education and innovation units</a> that has received funding and support from Microsoft and Kenyan telecoms firm Safaricom.</p><p>Erin Hayba, an associate community services officer and an innovation iFellow for UNHCR, says the aim is to give a laptop to each school to manage education information, including school attendance and learning, install computer labs in every secondary school, and provide computers for vocational training centres.</p><p>The project involves training teachers on how to use computers in the classrooms, and organising electricity and internet connections. Some funding is provided by a UNHCR campaign to provide solar power in schools.</p><p>For the project to succeed, Hayba says, teachers, parents and community leaders must be involved. She has been surprised by the enthusiasm she has encountered. \"[The refugee communities] are even contributing in small financial ways … Some of the computers are in [school] science labs. The refugees bought fabric and made curtains and covers to keep off the dust … It's that ownership.\"</p><p>These projects all have the common aim of increasing self-reliance among Dadaab residents, many of whom do not fit the classic profile of refugees but who still find themselves living extremely restricted lives.</p><p>\"If you give someone food it is only keeping them alive for a few days,\" says Noor Hassan. \"For the future, we need to be empowered. I would like the youth of Dadaab to be able to compete with the other diaspora refugees back in Somalia.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/1/25/1359131488061/MDG-migration-Dadaab-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jan/31/kenya-dadaab-innovative-educate-refugees","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/jan/31/kenya-dadaab-innovative-educate-refugees","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Why photos of One Direction won't save us from global warming","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-25T16:22:58Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/blog/2013/jan/25/one-direction-climate-comms","fields":{"body":"<p><a href=\"http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/2013.02.pdf\">New research</a> from universities in the US, Australia and the UK has tested how different pictures make people feel about whether climate change is important, and whether they can do something about it.</p><p>Inspired, we have decided to conduct our own experiment on you, dear readers.</p><p>Researchers showed people images used to illustrate newspaper climate change stories.

The flies carry the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs259/en/\" title=\"\">trypanosome parasite</a> that can cause sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock. But a group of scientists in Nairobi is developing a powerful insect repellent using the stench of waterbucks, a type of large antelope.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.asfg.org.uk/the-challenge/the-challenge\" title=\"\">About two-thirds of Africa's population</a> depend on small-scale agriculture, many of whom are livestock farmers. For these farmers, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/vector/en/index.html\" title=\"\">tsetse flies</a> are a serious threat to economic development and food security. The economic loss in Africa's cattle production as a result of nagana is an estimated $4bn (£2.5bn) each year, according to the <a href=\"http://www.stampoutsleepingsickness.com/about-sos-.aspx\" title=\"\">Stamp out sleeping sickness campaign</a>.</p><p></p><p>With funding from the European Commission, <a href=\"http://www.icipe.org/\" title=\"\">ICIPE</a> (International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology), a pan-African research organisation that investigates tropical insect science for development, has produced groundbreaking collars for livestock that contain the waterbuck smell, which tsetse flies do not like.</p><p></p><p>\"Every year we lose three million cows because of the disease; 60 million cows are also affected. The flies are one of the main reasons why 80% of the land in Africa is tilled by hand – simply because we don't have enough animal power,\" says Dr Rajinder Saini, head of ICIPE's animal health division and principal scientist. \"Fewer livestock also leads to less manure that could be used as organic fertiliser, which leads to lower yields of crop and fodder plant.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>\"Our approach has been to look at the ecology, biology and behaviour of the fly in detail, to look at the interaction between the parasite and the host, trying to develop a simple technology that farmers can use themselves instead of the top-down approach where everybody is dependent on foreign aid.\"</p><p></p><p>ICIPE is carrying out a two-year trial with farmers in Mombasa. They are 16 months into the trial, which includes 15,000 cows and 300 pastoralists.</p><p></p><p>\"The first solution we came up with was <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CEcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftcdc2.undp.org%2FGSSDAcademy%2FSIE%2FDocs%2FVol1%2F22%2520Kenya.pdf&amp;ei=D2HtUJfkO-nD0QW1vIAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGMonsFWkNWY4KnM6oQtMw7rHcRRA&amp;bvm=bv.1357316858,d.d2k\" title=\"\">NGU traps</a>, which attract and trap the flies,\" says Saini. \"But while working with the Masai, we found they needed more of a mobile technology; traps are stuck in the ground, these people move with their animal, so we started thinking of repellents. We looked at repellent from two different sources: synthetic sources and from animals that the fly does not like to feed upon, such as waterbucks.\"</p><p></p><p>ICIPE scientists studied why these animals are not attacked and have isolated powerful fly repellents from waterbuck skin, which reduce tsetse bites by up to 90%.</p><p></p><p>\"Waterbucks stink; lions leave them alone because of the smell and flies leave them alone because of the sweat. We identified the pertinent odour of waterbucks and brought it down to a handful of chemical components that are responsible for keeping the flies at bay. We put the chemical into a dispenser tube that can be tied into the neck of a cow,\" says Professor Christian Borgemeister, director general at ICIPE. \"The collar puts a coat of a waterbuck over a cow; as the herd moves along, the flies sense the cow as a waterbuck and stay away.\"</p><p></p><p>For the farmers in the trial, just outside of the Shimba Hills game reserve in Mombasa, <a href=\"http://www.icipe.org/volume-2-issue-no-2-2012.html\" title=\"\">the collars are a big hit</a>. Farmers can graze their animals early in the morning and late in the evening when flies are most active, and no longer need to light fires to keep away the flies.</p><p></p><p>\"One of my farms is near the national park where there are a lot of flies. A&nbsp;lot of my animals were infected. I might have been forced to sell my farm and move, but these collars have helped me a lot. Right now, they are free. After the trial ends we have been told they could be sold for 400 Kenyan shillings ($3, £1.90), but even if they sell them for 5,000 shillings, I am happy to pay for them because they work,\" says Joshua Wambua.</p><p></p><p>Another farmer, Jhapat Mwongela, says the collars have not only increased the productivity of his animals but improved his family's quality of life. \"I am now able to plant different things – cassava, corn, sweet potatoes – which require the land to be tilled quite a bit. Because my cows were not sick this year, I have made significant profit. I am able to pay for my children's school and medical fees. Even their diet has been diversified because whatever I am not growing, I can now afford to buy.\"</p><p></p><p>Pharmaceutical companies have been slow in developing drugs to tackle diseases carried by tsetse flies because of the perception that it is not a profitable market. According to Saini, most of the drugs in the market are 60-70 years old, and humans and cattle are becoming resistant.</p><p></p><p>As a not-for-profit organisation, ICIPE hopes that producing collars on a larger scale would makeprices even lower, meaning the technology would be available to a higher number of beneficiaries. However, as this is beyond their scope of work they are seeking public-private partnerships to develop the technology.</p><p></p><p>Borgemeister is not surprised by farmers' willingness to pay for the collars. He urges pharmaceutical companies to reassess their outlook and recognise a viable market in developing drugs and technology to tackle tsetse flies.</p><p></p><p>\"At the end of the day, farmers buy drugs. If this is your only source of livelihood, you're going to spare [cut back] even from your food [budget] to make this [sick] cow better.

Reinforcement is then sent to the affected area.</p><p>But Patrick Omondi, head of the species department at KWS, said that putting the alarm system in all parks is impossible since the costs would be huge and some are not wholly fenced in.</p><p>\"Some parks are very big and the idea would only work in conservancies which have a much smaller land area,\"  he said.</p><p>Tsavo national park, where the recent killings took place, is about the size of Belgium.

One charity cannot solve the problem of power just as they can't solve many of Africa's other big challenges such as clean water, decent education, irrigation, medicine and food.</p><p>Like mobile phones in the past ten years, solar lights will only become ubiquitous when the private sector embraces them; when there's a value chain that incentivises everyone from a large scale importer in Dar es Salaam; to a shop-keeper in rural Zambia; and to everyone in between, including local handymen to fix them when they break or shop-keepers to sell spare batteries.</p><p>Which is why <a href=\"http://www.solar-aid.org/\" title=\"\">SolarAid</a>, despite its name, has come to believe in a market based approach: selling solar lights, not giving them away. We quickly realised that we needed to commit to this approach and turn our charity project, <a href=\"http://www.sunnymoney.org/\" title=\"\">SunnyMoney</a>, into a social business. To encourage and stimulate the market; not undermine it with any well-meaning charity.</p><p>In the past 24 months, we've phased out the aid-based side of our work (big solar panels on schools and clinics funded with donor money). We now focus on building our social enterprise, SunnyMoney.</p><p>To change our charitable project into a company, we've had to deal with a huge 'to do' list of legal, financial and cultural changes, but here are four of the most important lessons from our experience so far.</p><h2><strong>Think of customers, not beneficiaries </strong></h2><p>SunnyMoney is a direct seller and distributor of small, portable solar lights in the rural areas of Africa. We like to think of ourselves as the Carphone Warehouse of solar lights. We don't manufacture. We're technology neutral, selling the lights – branded products made by specialist companies – which our customers tell us they want. It is a better way to operate. Aid is not wasted. Nobody gets a solar light unless they want it (because they have to buy it); so all our customers look after their hard won purchases. We don't talk of 'helping beneficiaries', instead we 'serve customers'. Our customers demand value for money, warranties and after-sales service. So we have to give it (instead of just dishing out aid and expecting them to be grateful).</p><h2><strong>Focus on scale</strong></h2><p>Our focus is on scale, so we need to sell lots. We've adopted the Bhag (big hairy audacious goal) approach, first written about by Jim Collins in 'Good to Great'. Ours is 'to eradicate the kerosene lamp from Africa by the end of this decade'. Our Bhag has created an urgency, made us more ambitious, creative, braver and obsessed with scale.</p><h2><strong>Focus on profit</strong></h2><p>SunnyMoney is now a social enterprise, owned by SolarAid. It has subsidiaries in Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia. We have a culture of target-setting and management accountability with a focus on sales, margins and profit. Profit is important to us. We're edging close to breaking even. This will help us to expand across Africa. Profit means we can become self sustaining; not reliant on donors. It dramatically leverages what donor funds we do receive.</p><h2><strong>Focus on performance</strong></h2><p>We're getting better at procurement, logistics and marketing. We've recruited top talent onto our board, including Derry Newman, former MD of Sony UK, who is bringing a rigour and analysis to our decision-making. We're now bringing in performance management systems, enterprise resources systems, direct marketing expertise; everything that will give us an edge and keep us growing faster.</p><p>As a result of these changes, SunnyMoney is now the biggest direct seller of solar lights in Africa by a big margin. We have sold 245,000 lights in the past three years. Of these, 182,500 have been sold in the last eight months. And over 45,000 have been sold in November 2012.</p><p>Turning SunnyMoney from a charity project into a business has been an exhilarating journey. The results have been staggering and,  we've only just begun.</p><p>It's not that we haven't needed charitable support. We have formed a company out of a charity, using charitable money instead of early-stage investment money. Our donors are enthusiastic about this move to a business mentality, as we're delivering greater impact than we could ever have done by remaining a charity.</p><p><em>Steve Andrews is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.solar-aid.org\" title=\"\"><em>SolarAid</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://www.sunnymoney.org/\" title=\"\"><em>SunnyMoney</em></a><em>.

The telecommunications services in Nepal have come across a long way.</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, <strong>centaur</strong> said:</p><blockquote><p>The big GDP events in Mozambique where I live have had little effect on the essentials of life for the majority poor. Infrastructure development is devoted almost exclusively to servicing mining needs.</p></blockquote><p>On Stephen Hale's blog, which asked whether global summits really tackled poverty, <strong>ipeanddevelopment</strong> responded:</p><blockquote><p>They most [sic] tackle Human Development and easily quantifiable figures of poverty, short-term solutions. Hunger, health etc. They don't consider long-term structural changes which allow states to stand by themselves.</p></blockquote><p>On our blog looking at whether social media can help save the world, <strong>SamuelSLee1</strong> wrote:</p><blockquote><p>I have witnessed firsthand how social media breaks down traditional communication barriers – senior officials like Dr Binagwaho truly \"get it\", and this is very exciting to see.

Of course the year ahead will bring unexpected suprises and breaking news but some events are easier to mark in the calender, as we already have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jan/01/2013-calendar-key-events-for-the-year-ahead\">done here at the Guardian</a>. Take a look below for just some of the events, announcements and anniversaries to look out for in 2013 and the key data sets you'll need.</p><h2>January - rail fares rise by an average of 4.3%</h2><p>Going back to work after the holidays can be tough but with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/jan/02/rail-fair-increases-commuter-routes\">above inflation rail and tube fare increases </a>which came into effect on the 2 January it just got that little bit worse for tens of thousands of commuters.</p><p>The cost of an average rail season ticket in Great Britain has now risen to £2,191, equivalent to 8% of the median UK salary and considerably higher than the £1,441 fuel cost of driving to work.</p><p>Rail fares in England, Scotland and Wales have increased by an average of 3.9%, the third successive year in which the rise has outstripped retail price index (RPI) inflation.</p><h2>February - Oscar winners announced</h2><p>There may be other glitzy film awards and honours in the <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/dec/13/awards-season-2012-13-nominees-winners\">2013 film awards season</a> but none so coveted as the famous golden statue. The 85th Academy awards will take place in Hollywood on Sunday 24 February.</p><p>Steven Spielberg's biopic of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149491/lincoln\">Lincoln</a>, starring Daniel Day Lewis appears to be a firm favourite for best film, with seven Golden Globe nominations. Kathryn Bigelow's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149492/zero-dark-thirty\">Zero Dark Thirty</a> which tells story of the hunt for Osama bin Laden is another contender after winning best film and best director at the New York Film Critics awards. </p><p>Oscar nominations will be announced on the 10 January but, in the meantime, take a look at the list of Golden Globes nominations. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/xanbrooks\">Xan Brooks</a> writes, \"the Globes are important in that they establish a consensus – setting up the main contenders for the protracted awards season that follows\".</p><h2>March - 16th meeting of CITES</h2><p>The 16th meeting of the ­<a href=\"http://www.cites.org/\">Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES) will take place on the 3-16 of March. </p><p>In the early 1990s, an annual import value of almost $160bn was estimated for all wildlife products including wild-sourced timber and fish products according to CITES.</p><p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/summary-statistics#How_many_threatened\">Red List of threatened species</a> shows the number of extinct, threatened and other species of animals in each Red List Category in each country.

It also states that:</p><p>• 45% will lose up to £50 a week (in 2013-14)</p><p>• 26% will lose between £50 and £100</p><p>• 12% will lose between £100 and £150 a week</p><p>• 17% will lose more than £150 a week</p></blockquote><h2>May - UEFA Champions League final takes place</h2><p>The UEFA Champions League final takes place on 25 of May. Can Barcelona win and move up to third in the all-time winners' table alongside Liverpool?</p><p>A list of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/datablog/2012/dec/24/world-best-footballers-top-100-list\">world's top 100 footballers by the Guardian</a> put Barcelona's Lionel Messi in top position. Of all the 100 players ranked, 12 play for Barcelona and 10 each for Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. </p><h2>June - G8 summit</h2><p>The UK assumes G8 presidency in 2013. Iit last assumed presidency of the G8 in 2005, when the 6-8 July Gleneagles summit was overshadowed by the news on 6 July that the Olympic Games had been awarded to London and then by the 7/7 bombings. This year's summit is due to take place on 17-18 June at Lough Erne resort, Co Fermanagh.</p><p>But who are the countries that are meeting and how do they compare? We've gathered some basic data on each country including population, unemployment rate and GDP growth. You can see the figures in the table below.</p><h2>July - the NHS is 65 years old</h2><p>On 5 July, the NHS will be 65 years old. The Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/dec/04/government-spending-department-2011-12\">annual government spending graphic</a> shows that £97.46bn was spent during 2011-12 by the NHS - down by 0.9% in real terms with cuts of 1.17% in primary care and 1% in dental services. However, there have been rises in hospital spending, A&amp;E and community health care. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-401916443'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/28/1354106157720/Governmment-spending-by-d-008.png' alt='Governmment spending by department' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Governmment spending by department Photograph: Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The PESA NHS (Health) numbers suggest that total NHS DEL increased by 0.02% in real terms in 2011-12, although this comprises a 0.5% increase in Resource DEL and an 11.2% cut in capital DEL. This probably suggests that there is some NHS money that is not being channeled through the Department of Health? Or is it because DEL is only part of overall spending? Explore the graphic to find out how much is spent by each department.</p><h2>A royal baby is due</h2><p>Whether you like it or not, news of the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy will make recurring appearances through 2013 and in July, named as the due month, it will be positively impossible to avoid.</p><p>Bets on the sex and name of the baby have been flowing since the announcement. <a href=\"http://www.paddypower.com/bet/novelty-bets/royal-specials?ev_oc_grp_ids=512041\">Paddy Power</a> currently gives 5/1 odds on the names Elizabeth and Victoria. Unfortunately, if you're thinking of putting your money on Hashtag or Fergie, the odds aren't good at 500/1.</p><h2>August - Edinburgh festival kicks off</h2><p>Come August and the arts world focuses its attention on one city: Edinburgh. </p><p>The Edinburgh festival, one of the largest and well-know arts festivals in the world, plays host to a collection of cultural performers and productions.</p><p>From opera to jugglers and baroque quartets, the festival is a celebration of the arts. A report into the impact of the event found that that visitors spend £261m every year in Edinburgh and in Scotland as a whole. Scotland correspondent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/severincarrell\">Severin Carrell</a> gives more <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/may/23/edinburgh-festival-economic-impact\">detail of the findings</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Four million tickets are sold (or don't exist when it comes to the 250,000 people who congregate near the castle for the free open air festival fireworks display each August). Of the £261m in additional spending by visitors, £41m went to hoteliers, B&amp;Bs and Edinburgh residents who cash-in by letting their flats, and £37m was spent in bars, cafes and restaurants.</p></blockquote><h2>September - Portuguese government due to repay bond redemptions and interest of €9.73bn</h2><p>On 23 September, the Portuguese government is due to repay bond redemptions and interest of €9.73bn (£7.92bn) as per the rescue package established with International Monetary Fund in April 2011. </p><p>As a whole, Europe owes €10,840,197,700,000 - or €10.84 trillion. But it is more meaningful to look at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/nov/07/euro-debt-crisis-data\">number as a percent of gross domestic product</a>, or GDP – how much that debt is as a proportion of the whole economy, which is almost equivalent to measuring your mortgage compared with the whole economic value of your household. </p><p>That gives us a European average of 84.9% in the second three months of this year - up from 83.4% in the first quarter. But that figure hides a lot of variation: Greece, at the top, owes 144.3%, up from 132.3% (although it has seen big GDP drops over the same period), followed by Italy at 126.1% and then Portugal at 117.5%. The UK is just above average at 86%. There's nothing inherently bad about having a huge debt - it depends who you owe it to and whether you can manage the payments. Bigger countries are also in a better position: essentially, if you owe the bank £50,000, you've got a problem; if you owe the bank £50,000,000, the bank's got a problem.</p><h2>October - the Man Booker prize is awarded</h2><p>Hilary Mantel won the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/oct/10/booker-prize-2012-winners-sales-data\">2012 Man Booker Prize</a> for Bring Up the Bodies, the sequel to her previous Booker-winning novel, Wolf Hall but who will win the 2013 prize?</p><p>The impact a Booker win has on sales is impressive, as the table below shows. Weekly sales for past winners rose anything from 463% (Mantel's Wolf Hall) to a staggering 1918% (Howard Jacobsen, The Finkler Question). Even for the most modest seller on the list - Kiran Desai's The Inheritance of Loss, which won in 2006 - the vast majority of sales came post-Booker (2,397 units before, 182,044 after).</p><h2>November - The Scottish government publishes its prospectus on Scottish independence</h2><p>The Scottish government is due to publish its prospectus on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/mar/07/scotland-spending-data-independence\">Scottish independence </a>in November 2013, setting out all the key policy, economic and political structures it wants to see in an independent Scotland in a single document. That paper will form the basis for the SNP's independence referendum campaign for autumn 2014.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/dec/17/census-scotland\">first results from Scotland's 2011 census</a> showed the numbers of usual residents broken down by age and gender, with figures going back for every census since 1911 (there was no census in 1941, due to the outbreak of the second world war). </p><p>The interactive graphic, below, shows how Scotland's population distribution has evolved over the last century. Click the arrows to cycle through years and see how age distribution changes.</p><h2>December - Nobel peace prize</h2><p>Last year <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/oct/07/nobel-peace-prize-winners-list-2011\">the European Union was announced as the 2012 Nobel peace prize winner</a> and the winners list for 2011 was split between three women: Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee from Liberia and Tawakkul Karman from Yemen. But who will win the 2013 Nobel peace prize?</p><p>The EU was awarded the prize in recognition of \"over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe\", and becomes the 25th institution to receive the prize since its creation in 1901. See the full list of winners from 1901 to 2012 below.</p><h2>Data summary</h2><table>\n      <caption>\n            Golden Globe nominations, 2012\n          </caption>\n      <thead>\n        <tr><th

With an eye-catching layout, easy-to-use format, and no-jargon approach, the book contains more than 300 stunning photographs covering over 200 species of birds and is accessible and informative, rather than purely identification-based. A handy, brief introduction provides visitors with background on the habitats of the national park, and the guide's habitat-based approach makes it simple to identify any bird species according to where it is found. Based on the firsthand experiences of the author, Birds of the Masai Mara is an ideal companion to all those visiting the national reserve and to bird aficionados interested in learning more about the region.<br /><ul><li> The only photographic guide to focus solely on the bird species of the Masai Mara National Reserve</li>\n<li> More than 300 remarkable photographs covering over 200 species</li>\n<li> Accessible text explores bird species behavior and species etymology</li>\n<li> A brief and handy introduction examines the habitats of the Masai Mara</li>\n<li> Easy-to-use habitat-based layout makes exciting birdwatching easy</li></ul><br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> This photographic field guide relies on sharp, clear photography, often several images superimposed onto the same page, to speed identification of birds by sex and age, and to help distinguish similar species. But it is unique amongst field guides because it includes a short informative essay about each species that not only describes relevant distinguishing marks for each species, but it also includes short vignettes about a special aspect for teach species. For example: \"Whistling ducks are sometimes called Tree Ducks in the Americas. However, their scientific name <em>Dendrocygna</em> means 'tree swan' -- all rather confusing considering that they are actually more closely related to geese than either ducks or swans!\" (p. 79). If you are visiting the Masai Mara, this book will serve you well. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8204/8216716246_7941aac1fe_m.jpg\" width=\"170\" height=\"240\" /> Animals of the Masai Mara (Wildlife Explorer Guides) by Adam Scott Kennedy and Vicki Kennedy [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691156019\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691156018/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691156018/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br /><strong>In-depth description:</strong> One of the greatest attractions of a trip to Kenya is the chance to see animals such as lions, cheetah, leopards, zebra, and giraffe up close and in their natural habitats. Animals of the Masai Mara is a lavish photographic guide that explores the charismatic wildlife most likely to be encountered by a safari visitor to the Masai Mara National Reserve in southwest Kenya. More than 140 stunning photographs showcase 65 mammals and 17 reptile species, including 6 snakes. Designed to be informative and locally accurate, rather than purely identification-based, this easy-to-use book pays particular attention to wildlife behavior and is written from the firsthand experiences of the authors and the knowledge of local safari guides. Numerous \"Top Tips\" throughout show readers how and where to locate specific species.

I was especially drawn to the antelopes and gazelles, but I also ran across this interesting little observation about giraffes (the observation is nothing new to me, but I was amused that the author describes it as \"urinalysis\"): \"Courtship and reproduction is cautiously slow and begins when the female is in oestrus. The dominant male carries out urinalysis with his tongue and typically grimaces with a lip-curl at the taste.\" (p. 78) Like its avian companion volume, you will love this book -- even if you never visit the Masai Mara!</p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8221/8346360676_597a07d7af_m.jpg\" width=\"164\" height=\"240\" /> Britain's Sea Mammals: Whales, Dolphins, Porpoises, and Seals and Where to Find Them (Britain's Wildlife) by Jon Dunn, Robert Still and Hugh Harrop [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691156606\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691156603/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691156603/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br /><strong>In-depth description:</strong> Britain's Sea Mammals is the essential field guide to all the sea mammals -- whales, dolphins, porpoises, and seals -- found in coastal Britain. The book features more than 100 stunning photographs and close to 40 detailed and beautiful illustrations of 34 species of sea mammals, paying special attention to the 14 species most readily seen and most likely to be encountered. Factoring in behavior and locations, introductory chapters look at sea mammal biology and ecology, and how, when, and where these creatures can be spotted.

The to-scale paintings of the regularly occurring cetaceans (pp. 105-106) are especially lovely. I also like the silhouetted diving sequences for each whale species. This book is essential for everyone who visits or lives along Britain's coasts.</p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8491/8256382827_ee9d6337f9_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"169\" /> A Visitor's Guide to South Georgia: Second Edition (Wild Guides) by Sally Poncet and Kim Crosbie [Princeton University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691156583\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691156581/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691156581/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br /><strong>In-depth description:</strong> This is the only illustrated guide specifically tailored to the needs of visitors to this remote and captivating part of the world, and it is the ideal book for armchair naturalists.<br />A Visitor's Guide to South Georgia features hundreds of color photographs of the diverse wildlife and breathtaking scenery to be found at this unique tourist destination.

More than a field guide, this book is packed with lots of fascinating natural history, history and current information about the island. For example, did you know that South Georgia is the same distance from the South Pole as Britain is from the North Pole? Yet much of South Georgia is encased in permanent ice, whereas Britain is not. This is due to the influence of the icy Antarctic current that isolates it from warmer water. If your dream is to visit Antarctica, this book will give you a whole new appreciation for the small island of South Georgia, which lies nearby and shares the same climate and much of the same endemic flora and fauna. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8501/8345286669_4b677c3744_m.jpg\" width=\"153\" height=\"240\" /> Comedy: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions) by Matthew Bevis [Oxford University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780199601714\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199601712/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AQH7EWY/livithescieli-21/\">kindle UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199601712/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AQH7EWY/livingthescie-20/\">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>In-depth description:</strong> To consider comedy in its many incarnations is to raise diverse but related questions: what, for instance, is humour, and how may it be used (or abused)? When do we laugh, and why? What is it that writers and speakers enjoy -- and risk -- when they tell a joke, indulge in bathos, talk nonsense, or encourage irony?<br />This Very Short Introduction explores comedy both as a literary genre, and as a range of non-literary phenomena, experiences and events. Matthew Bevis studies the classics of comic drama, prose fiction and poetry, alongside forms of pantomime, comic opera, silent cinema, popular music, Broadway shows, music-hall, stand-up and circus acts, rom-coms, sketch shows, sit-coms, caricatures, and cartoons. <br />Taking in scenes from Aristophanes to The Office, from the Roman Saturnalia to Groundhog Day, Bevis also considers comic theory from Aristotle to Freud and beyond, tracing how comic achievements have resisted as well as confirmed theory across the ages. <br />This book takes comedy seriously without taking it solemnly, and offers an engaging study of the comic spirit which lies at the heart of our shared social and cultural life.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> This book was immediately scooped up by my spouse, so I am going to ask him to write a review of it since I haven't seen it since the day it arrived. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8071/8345287177_206eabe2ac_m.jpg\" width=\"153\" height=\"240\" /> Rastafari: A Very Short Introduction by Ennis B.

It is estimated that 700,000 to 1 million people worldwide have embraced Rastafari, and adherents of the movement can be found in most of the major population centers and many outposts of the world. Most believers worship Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia (ruled 1930-1974), as God incarnate. They often embrace the spiritual use of cannabis and reject western society, called Babylon. Believers proclaim Africa (also \"Zion\") as the original birthplace of mankind, and the call to repatriation to Africa is a key tenet. Rastafari: A Very Short Introduction provides an account of this widespread but often poorly understood movement. Ennis B. Edmonds looks at the essential history of Rastafari, including its principles and practices and its internal character and configuration. He examines its global spread, its far-reaching influence on cultural and artistic production in the Caribbean and beyond, and its handling of gender issues.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> I am really looking forward to reading this book since just about everything it has to say will be new to me. Includes a number of black and white photographs and for once, I understand how the cover colour scheme was chosen -- it is the three colours of the Rastafari movement: red, gold and green. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8354/8346347246_1fe4121150_m.jpg\" width=\"153\" height=\"240\" /> Work: A Very Short Introduction by Stephen Fineman [Oxford University Press; 2012: <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780199699360\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199699364/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009R1UN96/livithescieli-21/\">kindle UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199699364/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009R1UN96/livingthescie-20/\">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>In-depth description:</strong> The image of a job captures our imagination from an early age, usually prompted by the question 'What do you want to be when you grow up?'. Work -- paid, unpaid, voluntary, or obligatory -- is woven into the fabric of all human societies. For many of us, it becomes part of our identity. For others it is a tedious necessity. Living is problematic without paid work, and for many it is catastrophic. <br />Steve Fineman tells the fascinating story of work -- how we strive for security, reward, and often, meaning. Looking at how we classify 'work'; the cultural and social factors that influence the way we work; the ethics of certain types of work; and the factors that will affect the future of work, from globalization to technology, this Very Short Introduction considers work as a concept and as a practical experience, drawing upon ideas from psychology, sociology, management, and social history.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> When I first saw this book's title, I laughed because I immediately thought of Oscar Wilde's sentiment: \"Work is the curse of the drinking classes.\" But after a brief look through the book, I was pleasantly surprised by the author's respectful and careful approach to the topic. This looks like yet another interesting addition to Oxford's fabulous \"VSI\" series. </p><p>What book(s) are you reading? How far are you along in the book? What do you think of it so far?

It is the international analogue to the domestic welfare state. This is often necessary during emergency. But all too often people get stuck in refugee camps for many years. Over 6 million of the world's refugees are in so-called <a href=\"http://www.prsproject.org\" title=\"\">protracted refugee situations</a>, with an average length of stay of 17 years – Somalis in Kenya, Eritreans in Sudan, Sudanese in Chad, Afghans in Iran and Pakistan, and Burmese in Thailand.</p><p>The existing humanitarian paradigm can be inefficient. It could fail to make use of the best products and processes available; prove unsustainable, requiring public money to be endlessly channelled into warehousing people; and may lead to dependency, often undermining people's ability to help themselves. Instead, there may be alternative ways of doing refugee protection, which draw upon untapped resources or build upon refugees' own skills, aspirations, and entrepreneurship.</p><p>Innovation is not about novelty or invention. It is about adapting to context. It is a methodology for change, often used in the private sector but, which is, with few exceptions, neglected in humanitarian work. It can be understood as a <a href=\"http://www.oxhip.org/publications/humanitarian-innovation-and-refugee-protection-2\" title=\"\">four-stage process</a>: problem specification, looking for potential solutions, piloting those solutions, and scaling them where appropriate.</p><p>Innovation is highly relevant to refugees in at least two areas: the emergency phase, in which alternative resources may be available across humanitarian sectors (water and sanitation, health, shelter, and internet and communications technology, for example) and protracted situations, in which innovation may provide ways to move beyond encampment through creating livelihood opportunities and self-sufficiency.</p><p>Innovation may come from the creativity of refugees themselves. By definition, refugees have had to survive and adapt in entrepreneurial ways. Even in the most restrictive camp environments, like the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jul/04/entrepreneurs-kenya-dadaab-refugee-camps\" title=\"\">Dadaab camps</a> in Kenya, small businesses thrive, and SMS and Facebook are ubiquitous and adapted to create economic opportunity. In Uganda, where refugees have the right to work, <a href=\"http://www.oxhip.org/2012/11/new-publication-refugee-livelihoods-and-the-private-sector-ugandan-case-study\" title=\"\">the majority in Kampala</a> are self-employed and in the Kisenyi district many <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/comment/jim-armitage-out-of-africa--a-scheme-where--helping-refugees-helps-everybody-8324215.html\" title=\"\">Somalis run thriving businesses</a> that even employ nationals. Access to remittances and the diaspora frequently provides the source of capital for entrepreneurship.</p><p>Yet such innovation is often constrained by context. Entrepreneurship might be better supported by partnerships that remove barriers. Training, mentoring, microfinance, and business incubation – through Refugee Innovation Centres, for example – could encourage self-reliance. A recent innovation camp held in Dadaab, supported by Microsoft and Safaricom, illustrates the potential.</p><p>Innovation appeals to private sector and could engage them in humanitarian work. If you can innovate for 43.5 million displaced people, you are effectively innovating for the bottom 2 billion people who live on less than $2 a day. That bottom of the pyramid innovation is where there is huge potential for growth, and offers an incentive for private sector engagement at every level – local, national, and even global. It is on this basis that UNHCR, for example, has adapted its private sector fundraising strategy to move beyond philanthropy and corporate social responsibility to recognise the potential of innovation.</p><p>We recently launched the <a href=\"http://www.oxhip.org\" title=\"\">Humanitarian Innovation Project</a>, based at the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford, which is researching the role of technology, innovation, and private sector in refugee protection. The project is built in partnership with <a href=\"http://www.unhcrinnovation.org\" title=\"\">UNHCR Innovation</a> and Return on Innovation, a US-based not-for-profit organisation. The aim is to develop a better understanding of the role that humanitarian innovation can play in creating more sustainable approaches to refugee protection.</p><p>So what is the way forward? A lot of existing work on innovation is mainly concerned with improving the work of NGOs and international organisations. A core aspect of our work is to identify and support grassroots innovation by refugees and find appropriate partnerships.</p><p>Research can contribute to this, but that isn't enough. We are looking to set up a Refugee Innovation Centre in an urban or rural areawhere refugees can access training, mentorship and business opportunities. The hope is that, over time, a bottom-up approach to innovation will contribute to a refugee assistance model built more on sustainability rather than long-term dependency and encampment.</p><p><em>Dr Alexander Betts is lecturer at the Department of International Development, University of Oxford, and director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.oxhip.org\" title=\"\"><em>Humanitarian Innovation Project</em></a></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

A new mobile app from the bank's finances team lets users find and monitor bank-funded projects near to where they live, using mapping and GPS technology. The app, which came out of a <a href=\"http://developmentdatachallenge.org/\" title=\"\">Development Data Challenge (DDC)</a> project last year, is available on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.worldbank.finances\" title=\"\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/world-bank-finances/id465555488?mt=8\" title=\"\">iTunes</a> and <a href=\"http://financesapp.worldbank.org/\" title=\"\">the web</a>, and connects directly to social media networks. Sam Lee, from the bank's finances team, says this will allow users to share what they find, feedback on data accuracy issues or report allegations of fraud and corruption.

After years of encouraging developing countries in Africa and elsewhere to grow them, but unable to allow its own farmers to do so, the environment secretary Owen Paterson has told a major conference that GM can secure countries' food supplies, is good for the public and can help limit climate change.</p><p></p><p>This is part of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jan/03/gm-food-british-public-persuaded-benefits\" title=\"\">a massive PR drive by government</a>, industry and free marketeers to shake off GM's \"Frankenfood\" image in Britain. But it will resonate deeply in sub-Saharan Africa, where the US and UK governments, industry bodies and seed companies have all been lobbying strongly for GM crops to be grown widely.</p><p></p><p>Britain is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jul/19/gm-crops-aid-uk-funding\" title=\"\">spending around £100m</a> on support for GM crops, supposedly for the world's poor people, while organisations including the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jul/06/sam-dryden-global-south-agriculture\" title=\"\">Gates foundation</a>, USAid, and the <a href=\"http://www.cgiar.org/\" title=\"\">Cgiar network</a> of agricultural research stations are backed by other rich countries to develop the technology.</p><p></p><p>But despite billions of dollars spent on research by rich countries on feeding hungry people, most developing countries remain suspicious of the claims, or convinced that the benefits will go mainly to the corporations that control the seeds and chemicals needed to grow the crops.</p><p></p><p>What is remarkable is not that GM crops have, after 20 years and so much money spent, now reached 19 out of more than 150 developing countries, but that most nations have managed to keep out a rapacious industry, and that only a handful of GM food commodity crops like oilseed rape, soya and maize are still grown, mainly for animals and biofuels.</p><p></p><p>GM cotton is widely grown in India and China, but GM foods are pretty well limited to the US and Latin America. Here's a rundown of the scant progress made in around 20 years by companies to introduce GM food to developing countries:</p><p></p><p>•<strong> South Africa</strong>, which grows some GM maize and soyabean, is one of only three African countries, along with Burkina Faso and Egypt, <a href=\"http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/biotech_crops_in_africa/download/Biotech_Crops_in_Africa-The_Final_Frontier.pdf\" title=\"\">planting commercialised GM crops</a> (pdf). In <strong>Egypt</strong>, 70 tonnes of maize seeds were imported in 2008, but a second shipment was barred entry last year. <strong>Burkina Faso</strong> grows mostly GM cotton and not food.</p><p></p><p>• The GM industry in <strong>Kenya</strong>, one of the biotech industry's prime targets in Africa, suffered a major setback last month after the government <a href=\"http://www.citizennews.co.ke/news/2012/local/item/5515-cabinet-wants-gmos-foods-banned\" title=\"\">banned the import and sale of all GM food</a>.</p><p></p><p>• In neighbouring <strong>Tanzania</strong>, the <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201211070167.html\" title=\"\">government has said it is \"not ready\"</a> for the crops.</p><p></p><p>• The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), <a href=\"http://isaaablog.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">talks of \"overwhelming trust and confidence\"</a> in GM crops and says it expects <strong>Mali</strong>, <strong>Togo</strong>, <strong>Nigeria</strong>, <strong>Kenya</strong>, <strong>Uganda</strong>, <strong>Tanzania</strong> and <strong>Malawi</strong> to start growing GM in the next few years. But ISAAA is an industry-backed body accused of hyping the take-up of the crops. The reality is that progress in introducing GM food crops to Africa has slowed almost to a halt, with no country altogether happy with the prospect of their introduction.</p><p></p><p>• <strong>India</strong> has placed a moratorium on planting its first GM food crop, and there are signs that farmers are increasingly unhappy with Bt cotton, which is widely grown but meeting resistance. A <a href=\"http://digitaljournal.com/article/323656\" title=\"\">leaked agriculture ministry advisory letter</a> to cotton-growing states admitted last year: \"Cotton farmers are in a deep crisis since shifting to Bt cotton. The spate of farmer suicides in 2011-12 has been particularly severe among Bt cotton farmers.\"</p><p></p><p>• After the US, Latin America has been the most enthusiastic. <strong>Brazil</strong> grows 29m hectares (71.6m acres) of GM soy and maize, and <strong>Argentina</strong> slightly less, but <strong>Mexico</strong> has delayed the introduction of GM maize until this year, <strong>Peru</strong> has approved a 10-year moratorium on the import and cultivation of GM seeds, and <strong>Bolivia</strong> has committed to giving up growing all GM crops by 2015. In Central America <strong>Costa Rica</strong> is expected to reject an application from a Monsanto subsidiary to grow GM corn.</p><p></p><p>• <strong>China</strong> is deeply cautious when it comes to growing GM food crops and has been shocked by reports of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2201536/GMO-How-China-US-secretly-tested-genetically-modified-golden-rice-children.html\" title=\"\">children being allegedly used for a GM food trial</a>.</p><p></p><p>GM advocates in Europe and the US accuse developing countries of being swayed by Greenpeace or other western environmental groups, but that is to malign their own scientists and farm experts who have done their own assessments of GM foods and advised caution.</p><p></p><p>In countries such as Britain, where few people have any link with the land, it is perhaps understandable to be scientifically gung-ho about GM. But in many developing countries, where life depends on seeds and where 90% of families may grow their own food, GM is not a rarified debate about science or health, but about survival, culture and how nature itself is best protected.</p><p></p><p>GM food has so far not delivered on its early promises of higher yields and reduced  pesticide use. Instead, like nuclear power, it has been racked by controversy, corruption, and debates about regulation, patents and ownership.</p><p></p><p>The British government and its GM advocates appeal to people with assertions that the technology wil make food cheaper and more plentiful, and think the public needs only to be educated into seeing the crops differently. With GM, it becomes increasingly clear they could learn a lot from developing countries' caution.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/1/3/1357233506806/MDG--GM-Food--Workers-har-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jan/04/uk-government-enthusiasm-gm","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jan/04/uk-government-enthusiasm-gm","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Credit ratings: how Fitch, Moody's and S&amp;P rate each country .

This signalled a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/14/fitch-uk-aaa-rating-at-risk\">\"slightly greater than 50% chance\" that Britain would lose its AAA rating with Fitch</a> in the next two years.</p><p>At the same time as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/feb/14/ratings-agencies-financial-sector?intcmp=239\">changing the UK's outlook to 'negative'</a>, Moody's made a range of  adjustments including downgrades for Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Spain.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-adjusts-ratings-of-9-European-sovereigns-to-capture-downside--PR_237716\">At that time, Moody's also announced</a> France and Austria would share the same fate as the UK with their outlooks being changed to negative.</p><p>Last October, Standard and Poors (S&amp;P) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/11/downgrade-madrid-bailout\"> downgraded Spain's sovereign ratings to BBB-, just one grade above junk status</a>. S&amp;P attached a \"negative outlook\" to its rating, a warning of another possible downgrade in the medium term.</p><p>Just days earlier Moody's cut its assessment of Cyprus's government bonds, downgrading them by one notch from Ba3 to B3. The ratings agency cited fragile and weakening banks as the main factor in its decision, stating:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>In order to maintain appropriate domestic bank capital levels, the Cypriot government will likely need to provide financial support to the country's banks that could threaten the sustainability of the government's debt burden</p></blockquote><p>So, who are the ratings agencies? The big three agencies are <a href=\"http://www.fitchratings.com/index_fitchratings.cfm\">Fitch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.moodys.com/cust/default.asp\">Moody's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.standardandpoors.com/home/en/us\">Standard &amp; Poors</a>. What they do is assess how likely a borrower is to be able to repay its debts and help those trading debt contracts in the secondary market. </p><p>That means for those trading debt contracts such as Treasury gilts after they have been issued, ratings agencies help assess a fair price to charge. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/16/downgrade-aaa-rating-moodys\">Ratings agencies have been criticised</a> for having too much clout in jittery markets during the financial crisis. They were widely attacked for failing to warn of the risks posed by certain securities, in particular mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>Losing your rating or being downgraded can have a fatal effect on your country's ability to borrow money on the markets.</p><p>Thanks to the three big agencies, we can bring you the ratings of countries around the world as of today. Because each agency's approach is slightly different, we have colour-coded them in three broad categories too. All the ratings have been updated today. Ratings for previous updates last year and in 2011 are in the spreadsheet, so you can see how ratings have changed over time.</p><p>Can you do something with the <a

drip: 'Smart' handpumps send signal that water has run out | Paige McClanahan","webPublicationDate":"2013-01-01T09:00:03Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jan/01/data-drip-smart-handpumps-water","fields":{"body":"<p>Installing handpumps in far-flung villages has long been a favourite activity of aid agencies and development NGOs. But the pumps rarely last forever: at any given time, only two of every three handpumps in rural areas are actually working, and aid workers don't often go back to check up on the status of the pumps installed several years before.</p><p></p><p>That's precisely the problem a <a href=\"http://oxwater.co.uk/\" title=\"\">team of researchers</a> at Oxford University are trying to tackle. They have created a device that uses mobile phone technology to generate – and transmit – data on handpump use in rural <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kenya\" title=\"\">Kenya</a>. They hope their approach will ultimately help to improve water access in drought-stricken areas.</p><p></p><p>This year, the UN said new data showed the millennium development goal (MDG) target to halve the number of people without access to safe drinking water <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/mar/06/water-millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">had been met in 2010</a>, five years before the deadline. Even so, an <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/wash/\" title=\"\">estimated 780 million people</a> – more than a 10th of the global population – live without basic and reliable water supplies; the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2010/water_20100315/en/index.html\" title=\"\">overwhelming majority, roughly 80%</a>, live in rural areas.</p><p></p><p>\"There are a lot of gadgets and gizmos and devices out there, but those alone don't really resolve the enduring problem of rural water supply sustainability,\" says lead researcher Rob Hope, a senior research fellow at the <a href=\"http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">school of geography and the environment</a> at Oxford. \"It's really the institutional reforms that emerge from using the information in a more effective manner. That's where our research is really focused.\"</p><p></p><p>This is how their idea works: the team implant a mobile data transmitter into the handle of a water pump in a rural village. The transmitter monitors how much the handle moves, giving a rough estimation of the volume of water that is being pumped from the well. The device, which is powered by a long-life battery, sends periodic text messages to relay this information to research teams in Nairobi and Oxford.</p><p></p><p>If a pump stops being used, that will show up quickly on the computer interface. A member of the team can then call someone in the village to ask about the state of the pump. If the pump needs to be fixed, then someone can be dispatched immediately to repair it. The researchers say they should be able to respond to a breakdown – and get water flowing again – within 24 hours.</p><p></p><p>The pilot phase of the project kicked off in August, when researchers began installing these \"smart\" handpumps in 60 villages in the Kyuso district in Kenya. Each pump serves about 200 people, Hope says, so the initial phase of the project could have an impact on a population of more than 10,000.</p><p></p><p>\"There's a very scarce water supply in the dry season [in Kyuso], so handpumps are critical for the survival of the people, as well as their livelihood systems,\" Hope says, adding that most people in the region are subsistence farmers.</p><p></p><p>The project, which was described in detail in a <a href=\"http://www.iwaponline.com/jh/up/jh2012183.htm\" title=\"\">journal article</a> this year, is funded by the UK government through the <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Department for International Development</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Economic and Social Research Council</a>. With the pilot phase up and running, they hope to expand the project to other areas of Kenya in 2013.</p><p></p><p>\"There's a lot more interest among government and the donor community [in Kenya], which is important,\" Hope says. \"We work very closely with government on the work that we do, and having them supportive, understanding and interested from the outset is fundamental for the sustainability [of the project].\"</p><p></p><p>\"It's not just about the technology,\" he says, noting that everything that the group is doing is <a href=\"http://www.iwaponline.com/jh/up/jh2012183.htm\" title=\"\">open-source</a>. \"The technology is a means to generate information at a scale that allows institutional improvements – and that's the key thing.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/12/21/1356101857012/MDG--Water-pump--drought--003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jan/01/data-drip-smart-handpumps-water","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jan/01/data-drip-smart-handpumps-water","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"The world's best footballers: the top 100 list","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-24T12:00:00Z","sectionId":"football","id":"football/datablog/2012/dec/24/world-best-footballers-top-100-list","fields":{"body":"<p>The Guardian's choice of the world's top 100 footballers has been unveiled today <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/interactive/2012/dec/20/top-100-footballers-in-the-world-interactive\">with Lionel Messi topping the list at No1</a>.</p><p>An 11-strong international panel of experts were asked by Guardian Sport to name their top 30 players in action today and rank them in order of preference.

Guilty, if so. Not all may agree, but it is a personal belief that these pages are currently home to perhaps the finest collective of football writers and analysts in the English language. From Daniel Taylor to Sid Lowe, Jonathan Wilson to Michael Cox, Richard Williams to Raphael Honigstein, we are blessed with writers whose knowledge covers not only the English game but who offer a genuinely global perspective.</p></blockquote><p>The ranking, which has slowly been revealed in a countdown from the 20 December, is now published in full and the world's top 100 footballers are listed below for you to view.</p><p>The choice of Messi at No1, beating Cristiano Ronaldo into second place, is explained below by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sidlowe\">Sid Lowe</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There was only one name and one position on which all 11 members of the panel were in unanimous agreement; the world No1, Lionel Messi.

Despite only a few English players making it onto the top 100, the Premier League is the best represented with 27 players, followed by La Liga with 23. The chart above shows the top five leagues by the number of footballers appearing in the list.</p><p>Barcelona is the best represented club with 12 players on the list followed by Bayern Munich and Real Madrid with 10 each. Chelsea and Manchester City each have eight players on the list.</p><p>The average age for the footballers appearing on the list is 26 years old. Stephan El Shaarawy, aged 20, is the youngest player in the top 100 whilst Javier Zanetti is the oldest at 39 years old. </p><p>So how does the list break down by nationality? 16 of the players are Spanish, 12 Brazilian and 10 German. There are 8 Argentinian players on the list and both Italy and France have seven footballers on the top 100.</p><p>If you're wondering which position is the most common amongst the top 100 players then we've also broken that down too: 36 are midfielders, 29 forward, 19 defenders.

Our political leaders, for the most part, are playing a defensive game on sustainability so innovation will continue to come from business and civil society. Pressure will mount on government to provide incentives for sustainable consumption and production, though getting rid of bad incentives such as subsidies for unsustainable agriculture will continue to feel like Don Quixote tilting at windmills.</p><p>The private sector and civil society will partner around water conservation and quality, aim to reduce industrial use and contamination, increase agricultural efficiency (the sector uses 60% of the world's freshwater) improve access to potable water, and ensure long term supply. Energy use and emissions reductions will continue to be a priority, though the sheer scale of the change needed will continue in a go-slow and depressingly insufficient mode. For example, deforestation is responsible for 20% of the world's emissions, and could be much reduced with government and market incentives for sustainably produced wood and agriculture products and forest carbon. The recent United Nations negotiations in Doja however did not move this forward appreciably, and 2013 is unlikely to see this improve.</p><p>We will continue to look for technological fixes to limited resources – modified seeds, more chemicals, information technology, miracle cleanup technologies, but our efforts will be frustrated unless we also begin to recreate the natural systems we have blithely destroyed. In one example, the protection against storm surges of wetlands buffering cities such as New York and New Orleans have been mostly destroyed. Any solution aimed at protected waterfront property against sea level rise and climate change, will need to include the restoration of key wetland and mangrove habitat as buffers in addition to creating sea walls, inflatable balloons that protect underground tunnels, etc.</p><p>Work on sustainability in 2013 will increasingly become a focus for innovation, for bright people who are problem solving – redesigning and making their businesses more competitive. This is happening at large companies such as Unilever, where the CEO Paul Polman has reshaped the company's business and strategic plan to double its business, while aiming to halve the environmental footprint and source 100% sustainably. In the process he and his team are redesigning engagements with suppliers, taking cost out of the system, delivering good value to shareholders and protecting water, soil, biodiversity and providing sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>Redesign is also happening at the field level, such as in Kenya where small flower farmers are transforming their land so it protects the community watershed, composts waste, creates closed loop systems where tilapia waste is used as fertiliser, and provides good jobs for the community. Or in the cocoa industry, where demand for sustainable cocoa from companies such as Mars, Kraft and Hershey's means intermediaries are learning new skills in sustainable practices and passing their lessons on.</p><p>In 2013, we will see more recognition that sustainability can be a source of innovation, not just risk avoidance and we should expect to see more scaling up and greater engagement across sectors, including the laggards such as electronics and mining.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/newsroom/experts/tensie-whelan\" title=\"\"><em>Tensie Whelan</em></a><em>, president of the Rainforest Alliance</em></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

They said they are \"not able to sign the agreement in its current form\" at the end of a International Telecoms Union (ITU) conference in Dubai.</p><p></p><p>The proposals, coming after two weeks of complex negotiation, would have given individual governments greater powers to control international phone calls and data traffic, but were opposed as the conference had seemed to be drawing to a close late on Thursday.</p><p></p><p>The move seems to safeguard the role of the internet as an unregulated, international service that runs on top of telecoms systems free of direct interference by national governments.</p><p></p><p>The US was first to declare its opposition to the draft treaty. \"It is with a heavy heart and a sense of missed opportunities that I have to announce that the United States must communicate that it is unable to sign the agreement in its current form,\" Terry Kramer, head of the US delegation, told the conference, after what had looked like a final draft was approved.</p><p>\"The internet has given the world unimaginable economic and social benefit during these past 24 years. All without UN regulation. We candidly cannot support an ITU Treaty that is inconsistent with the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance.\"</p><p></p><p>The US was joined in its opposition by the UK, Canada, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Kenya, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Qatar and Sweden. All said they would not sign the proposed final text, meaning that although a number of other countries will sign it, the treaty cannot be effectively implemented.</p><p></p><p>\"In the end, the ITU and the conference chair, having backed themselves to the edge of a cliff, dared governments to push them off,\" <a href=\"http://news.dot-nxt.com/2012/12/14/internet-humbles-un-telecoms-a\" title=\"\">commented</a> Kieren McCarthy, who runs the internet consultancy dot-nxt. \"They duly did.\"</p><p></p><p>But Access Now, a lobbying group against ITU oversight of the internet, said that \"despite all of the assurances of the ITU secretariat that the WCIT wouldn't discuss internet governance, the final treaty text contains a resolution that explicitly 'instructs the [ITU] secretary-general to take the necessary steps for the ITU to play and active and constructive role in... the internet.'\" It urged governments not to sign it.</p><p></p><p>The ITU is a UN organisation responsible for coordinating telecoms use around the world. The conference was meant to update international treaties which have not evolved since 1988, before the introduction of the internet.</p><p></p><p>But the conference has been the source of huge controversy because the ITU has been accused of seeking to take control of the internet, and negotiating behind closed doors. Google has mounted a vociferous campaign against conference proposals that would have meant that content providers could be charged for sending data and which would have given national governments more control of how the internet works. Instead, lobbyists have said the treaties should simply not mention the internet at all because it is a service that runs atop telecoms systems.</p><p></p><p>But a bloc led by Russia, with China and the United Arab Emirates – where the conference is being held – said the internet should be part of the treaties because it travels over telecoms networks. A Russia-driven vote late on Wednesday seemed to push to include the internet in a resolution – a move the US disagreed with.</p><p></p><p>The failure to reach accord could mean that there will be regional differences in internet efficacy. \"Maybe in the future we could come to a fragmented internet,\" Andrey Mukhanov, of Russia's Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications, told the Reuters news agency. \"That would be negative for all, and I hope our American and European colleagues come to a constructive position.\"</p><p></p><p>The US and Europe have indicated that they instead want private companies to drive internet standards.</p><p></p><p>McCarthy, who has published ITU planning documents that would otherwise have been kept out of sight on dot-nxt's website, criticised the conduct of the meeting: \"attendees were stunned to find a conference style and approach stuck in the 1970s,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Writing on the dot-nxt site, he said: \"A constant stream of information was available only in downloadable Word documents; disagreement was dealt with by increasingly small, closed groups of key government officials; voting was carried out by delegates physically raising large yellow paddles, and counted by staff who walked around the room; meetings ran until the early hours of the morning, and \"consensus by exhaustion\" was the only fall-back position.\"</p><p></p><p>Attempts by the ITU to encourage the US to sign the proposed treaty by removing clauses – such as one that would give individual countries rights over website addresses – failed.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/columnists/2012/12/14/1355470496254/People-use-computers-at-a-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/14/telecoms-treaty-internet-unregulated","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2012/dec/14/telecoms-treaty-internet-unregulated","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Sustainable technologies: finding financing models that work","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-13T11:59:06Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2012/dec/13/sustainable-technologies-financing-models","fields":{"body":"<p>Poverty reduction and environmental sustainability are sometimes seen as separate issues, but often tackling one also helps to address the other.</p><p>Take cookstoves for example: dirty but cheap, they can trap people in poverty. Smoke inhalation from traditional cookstoves and open fires causes nearly <a href=\"http://www.sustainableenergyforall.org/actions-commitments/country-level-actions/item/60-ghana-leads\" title=\"\">2 million deaths annually</a>, with women and young children the most affected.</p><p>Other examples are solid waste disposal and kerosene lamps. All three have sustainable alternatives: clean-burning stoves, solar toilets and solar lights. Yet half of the world's population – and <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/27/10815.full.pdf\" title=\"\">75% of south Asians</a> – continue to burn solid fuels in traditional cookstoves, only <a href=\"http://www.lightingafrica.org/newsroom/press-releases.html\" title=\"\">3% of Africans have bought a solar light</a>, and take-up of <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/08/gates-foundation-toilets/\" title=\"\">solar toilets</a> is low. There are many reasons why sustainable alternatives aren't popular – and some are directly related to the global development community.</p><p>\"Energy is the hidden issue, it's amazing that the big NGOs don't talk about it more\", says Steve Andrews, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.solar-aid.org/\" title=\"\">SolarAid</a>, a social enterprise that sells solar lamps in rural Kenya and Tanzania. \"In the UK, people spend less than 0.5% of the household budget on lighting. Whereas in Kenya it's 15%, typically on kerosene ... You can't have development without access to energy.\"</p><p>The difficulty SolarAid has in persuading people to buy a solar lamp is the initial cost. \"An average Kenyan family in rural areas spends $75 (£46) a year on kerosene, whereas a solar lamp will last for four years and costs $40 (£25)\", says Andrews. \"But the problem is our customers don't have $40 and don't have access to credit. That's the fundamental challenge that we work with every day\".</p><p>It's a problem many recognise. Martin Fisher is co-founderand CEO of <a href=\"http://www.kickstart.org\" title=\"\">KickStart International</a>, a provider of sustainable technologies to small-scale African farmers. The company's irrigation pumps cost $35 (£28) and $100 (£62) and produce an average $200-300 (£124-186) profit from the first harvest alone. But as with SolarAid, his customers simply don't have $35. \"In general the challenge is cashflow\", says Fisher. \"Financing for a rural farmer in Africa is something that no one has really figured out how to do cost effectively\".</p><p>To counter this, KickStart is piloting an innovative micro-payment system using mobile phones. \"It's something we call 'cellphone lay-away' – small-holders can make micro-payments over their mobile phone. Whenever they get a bit of money ... little by little they pay for the pump, and then they can go to the shop and pick it up.\" So far it has only been trialled on a small scale in Kenya, but already over 250 pumps have been sold this way.</p><p>Other well-known models exist, in particular micro-finance. In <a href=\"http://www.grameenfoundation.org/asia/bangladesh\" title=\"\">Bangladesh, Grameen Bank</a>, BRAC, and ASA account for 85% of the country's active borrowers<a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\"> and have helped bring clean energy to millions of people, in particular through solar panels. \"That helps with the upfront cost problem\", says Camilla Toulmin, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development</a>. \"You pay back over a relatively short period of time and then the panel is yours. The panels often then produces energy for others in the community, for which the owner can then charge a small fee – it becomes an ongoing economic concern.\"</p><p>One model that most parties now agree doesn't work is handing out sustainable technologies for free. \"Mobile phones didn't spread across Africa because of aid, it's because there was a value chain\", says Andrews. \"We believe that the only way that solar lights are going to penetrate every corner of Africa, is with a market-based approach.\"</p><p>Allen Eisendrath, energy division chief at <a href=\"http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/economic_growth_and_trade/energy/\" title=\"\">USAid's office of energy and infrastructure</a> believes this requires a change in mindset for some in the aid community. \"I think we're in a transition from a donor-driven supply chain where we grant the equipment – which was a common programme in the past, such as our <a href=\"http://philippines.usaid.gov/about/public_private\" title=\"\">Amore programme in the Philippines</a> with 40,000 connections to PV – to recognising that the private sector value chain in supplying clean technologies is critical. We have begun to work on the financing needs for example through leasing models.\"</p><p>Camilla Toulmin also agrees that this should be the fundamental role of development agencies. \"NGOs need to be demonstrating on the ground some of the different models that can work, both in terms of innovation in technology and also innovation in access ... to act as a bridge or broker to potential sources of funding to a large number of small producers [and also] push governments to maintain the pledges that they make.\"</p><p>SolarAid and KickStart both take donor money to fund education drives. SolarAid works with schools to promote $10 (£6) study lamps – the early adopters tend to come back to buy $40 (£25) lamps for the family, says Andrews. Similarly donor funds help KickStart teach farmers about the benefits of irrigation. \"Only 4% of the farmland in sub-Saharan Africa is irrigated, compared to Asia where it's about 42%\", says Fisher.</p><p>Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/27/10815.full.pdf\" title=\"\">a study in July</a> (pdf) found that 98% of Bangladeshis still use dirty cookstoves, and most do not consider smoke a serious health threat. If education programmes and access to credit are the ways towards a sustainable future for developing countries, then they still have a long way to go.</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The workshop aimed at finding how different approaches work.</p><p>Dr KO Antwi-Agyei from Ghana, which has one of the most successful immunisation programmes in Africa, shared his experiences through a presentation on 'Making reaching every district (RED) work:&nbsp; an experience from Ghana.' Country director of Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program for <a href=\"http://www.jsi.com/JSIInternet/\" title=\"\">John Snow, Inc.</a>, in India, Dr Karan Singh Sagar, talked about 'Performance improvement using supervision and monitoring:&nbsp;an experience from India.'&nbsp; Both discussed the relevance of their innovative intervention and how it was designed, planned, implemented, adapted, and spread.</p><p>In the Volta Lake region of eastern Ghana, for example, the health authorities have devised strategies across districts to reach distant fishing communities residing around the lake. In some urban and adjoining areas in Kenya, health staff send SMS messages to remind mothers of immunisation appointments.&nbsp;In India, supervision is organised in periodic pulses at district-level with results instantly analysed, discussed and fed back to all staff.&nbsp;In Timor-Leste [East Timor] and some areas of India, health staff are experimenting with a combined monitoring and health education tool called \"my village is my home,\" which tracks newborns through completion of their vaccinations and establishes&nbsp;a new social norm of shared responsibility between individual families and their community.&nbsp;</p><p>A recent Bill &amp; Melinda Gates-funded study by <a href=\"http://arise.jsi.com/technical-resources\" title=\"\">Arise</a>  found that well-performing districts in Ghana, Ethiopia and Cameroon&nbsp;could be distinguished from stagnant districts by having linked peripheral health services with communities in a variety of creative ways.&nbsp;Efforts are underway in several countries to use mobile phone technology to track vaccine supply levels and adjust re-supply accordingly.&nbsp;Opportunities for districts and health facilities to learn from each other&nbsp;are needed to accelerate replication of good practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I believe the ultimate innovation could be to deliberately create a stimulating culture of learning that seeks to do this!&nbsp;Such a culture of learning is more likely to emerge when it is inclusive of multiple perspectives, diverse disciplines and broad partnerships and when staff have an opportunity to learn from peers working on the same problems.&nbsp;</p><p>Innovation can also be thought of as a process leading to better learning of what works and how it works in given contexts. While we should more generally identify promising and proven approaches appropriate for our unique contexts, these may or may not be novel or innovative.&nbsp;Investments in incremental improvement in activities, processes and products operating at scale can also overcome programme stagnation, lead to significant performance improvement and produce value over time.</p><p><em>Robert Steinglass is a senior immunisation adviser at John Snow, Inc., and immunisation team leader for the USAid-funded </em><a href=\"http://www.healthynewbornnetwork.org/partner/maternal-and-child-health-integrated-program-mchip\" title=\"\"><em>Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program</em></a></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

By their very nature, the extractive industries go against everything that sustainability practitioners stand for: they remove without replacing and they have major impacts on the local environment, not to mention the impact on the communities around the mines themselves.</p><p>But on the other hand, we all use things that are ultimately linked to mining – from technology to jewellery to utensils and automobiles, all are made with minerals that have come from the very mines environmentalists campaign against.</p><p>In the last few decades, policy-makers have been working to address some of the concerns about mining. Large-scale mining operations must now include environmental impact assessments and mine closure planning by law in most countries, and the <a href=\"http://www.icmm.com/\" title=\"\">International Council on Mining and Metals</a> (ICMM) was formed to act as a catalyst for social and environmental performance improvement in the industry internationally.</p><p>Most recently, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act\" title=\"\">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> not only brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the US since the reforms post-Great Depression, it also had a global resonance. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced in August that <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/2012-163.htm\" title=\"\">companies would be required to disclose</a> if they use tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten when those minerals are \"necessary to the functionality of a product\" — which means if you want to sell your product in the US, you need to know your supply chain inside out.</p><p>The \"three Ts and gold\" are also known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_minerals\" title=\"\">conflict minerals</a>; manufacturers often source these minerals from areas such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and their sale has been fuelling war, human rights abuses and the use of child labour. Danish filmmaker Frank Piasecki Poulsen <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/blog/congo-child-labour-mobile-minerals?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">recently wrote</a> for Guardian Sustainable Business about what he found when he entered the village of Bisie in the eastern Congo: likening it to \"the front yard of hell\", he was shocked by the presence of soldiers, prostitutes and child workers. And this is the beginning of a supply chain that eventually results in your mobile phone.</p><p>The industry itself has made efforts. The <a href=\"http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/\" title=\"\">Kimberley Process</a>, a diamond industry assurance launched in 2000, has 51 participants representing 77 countries, all of whom certify the diamonds they source are not blood diamonds – though this has ultimately failed to stem the flow of blood diamonds, leading to key proponents, including founder members, to abandon the scheme.</p><p>In the last few months the gold industry, facilitated by the World Gold Council, launched a similar certification scheme, the <a href=\"http://www.gold.org/about_gold/sustainability/conflict_free_standard/\" title=\"\">Conflict-Free Gold Standard</a>, an industry-led approach to combat the potential misuse of mined gold to fund armed conflict. It will require companies handling gold along the supply chain to certify they have not used conflict minerals; reporting begins in January, so time will tell if this is more successful than its diamond counterpart.</p><p>On top of all that, ethical campaigners are making sure the world at large knows exactly what goes on in mining, so the traditional smokescreen is well and truly coming down.</p><p>It's a bit easier to legislate large-scale mining, but the question of artisanal mining proves the trickiest – and it is these small-scale operations that are most often the source of conflict minerals.</p><p>So is all this work, legislation and campaigning making a difference? On Thursday 13 December from 2-4pm GMT we'll be discussing this very question. Our panel of experts will talk about the sustainability measures in place in the mining sector, how to assure the supply chain, the impact of Dodd-Frank, and how the sector can address the issues it faces.</p><h2>Panel </h2><p><a href=\"http://blog.gregvalerio.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Greg Valerio</strong></a> is the Founder of <a href=\"http://www.credjewellery.com/\" title=\"\">CRED Jewellery</a>, the world's leading ethical luxury jewellery house and the co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.fairjewelry.org/\" title=\"\">Fair Jewellery Action</a>, a coalition of jewellers from around the world who advocate for human rights and environmental justice.

Troubled regimes may have fallen around the globe but the latest corruption index from <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi\">Transparency International</a> shows the old problems are as rife as they ever were.</p><p>The CPI scores countries on a scale of zero to 100, with zero indicating high levels of corruption and 100, low levels.  Two thirds of the 176 countries ranked in the 2012 index score below 50 - meaning they are considered significantly corrupt. It's not an uncontroversial organisation - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/may/22/seeingthroughtransparencyin\">as you can see from this report on Venezuela</a>. But it is the only list of its kind.</p><p>The lowest scored country in Europe, however, is troubled Greece - ranked down 14 places to number 36. Syria too, presently in the middle of civil war, is down 15 places to number 144, making it one of the most corrupt countries on earth. Egypt, presently in the middle of demonstrations, is down six places to 118 out of 174 countries ranked by the index. </p><p>And the most corrupt places in the world are not the most surprising. Unstable governments, often with a legacy of conflict, continue to dominate the bottom rungs of the CPI. Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia share last place with a score of only eight out of 100 for transparency.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-401092557'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/1/1354325918766/corruption460.png' alt='Corruption interactive map of the world' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Corruption interactive map of the world.

While critics note that measuring perceptions of corruption is not the same as measuring corruption itself, the latter is almost impossible to do - as the corrupt are usually keen to cover up their tracks, hard data on graft and bribery is notoriously difficult to come by.</p><p>The full data is <a href=\"#data\">below</a> - what can you do with it?</p><h2>Data summary</h2><table>\n

Information technology has the capacity to transform the way governments and the development sector respond to the needs of the poor and marginalised, and expand south-south co-operation (the exchange of resources, technology and knowledge between developing&nbsp;countries).</p><p>The potential of technology to push through positive change is specifically included in the millennium development goals. MDG8, on developing a global partnership for development, includes a target to make the benefits of new technologies, especially ICT, readily available to people around the world, in co-operation with the private sector.</p><p>The use of mobile phones, and SMS technology in particular, has proved transformational, enabling healthcare workers to stay in touch with hospitals in rural communities, and farmers to access data and advice from remote areas.</p><p>So what's next? The application of mobile technology to development work has almost endless potential. Earlier this year, researchers from the University of Oxford developed data transmitters that fit inside water pumps and send text messages if one of the devices breaks down. The \"smart\" handpumps are being trialled in 70&nbsp;villages in Kenya.</p><p>But the real change, according to Ken&nbsp;Banks, founder of kiwanja.net, an organisation that supports technological innovation in the developing world, will be the rise of locally developed solutions to local challenges. Banks is the developer behind FrontlineSMS, a free, open-source SMS platform that anyone can download and use as a communications platform. By December 2011, it had been downloaded 20,000 times and used for everything from monitoring elections in Nigeria to training rural medics in Ecuador. As&nbsp;open-source technology for mobile platforms, innovations like FrontlineSMS are essentially a blank canvas for grassroots organisations to apply to any&nbsp;local context.</p><p>\"The rise of homegrown solutions to development problems will be most crucial in future,\" says Banks. \"That means African software developers increasingly designing and developing solutions to African problems, many of which have previously been tackled by outsiders. This, I think, will be the biggest change in how development is&nbsp;'done'.\"</p><p><em><strong>Commissioned by</strong> Annie Kelly<br /><strong>Supervising editor for GNM:</strong> Sarah Jewell (<a href=\"mailto:sarah.jewell@guardian.co.uk\">sarah.jewell@guardian.co.uk</a>)<br /><strong>Produced for</strong> Guardian Business &amp; Professional by Seven Plus to a brief agreed with STARS Foundation<br /><strong>Paid for by</strong> STARS Foundation.<br />All editorial overseen and controlled by the Guardian<br /><strong>Contact </strong>Rachel Joy on 020-3353 2688 (<a href=\"mailto:rachel.joy@guardian.co.uk\">rachel.joy@guardian.co.uk</a>)<br />For information on supplements visit: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sponsored-content\">guardian.co.uk/sponsored-content</a></em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/commercial/2012/12/4/1354641195284/A-woman-outside-her-shop--005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2012/dec/05/information-technology-connecting-developing-world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2012/dec/05/information-technology-connecting-developing-world","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"For the food and drink industry, water security is no small beer","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-04T15:26:48Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/localism-water-security-food-drink-industry","fields":{"body":"<p>Many might envy Andy Wood. He oversees a successful regional brewery and counts some of the UK's leading retailers among his customers. He also gets to work in the picturesque town of Southwold on the Suffolk coast. But the success of <a href=\"http://adnams.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Adnams</a> – which produces around 85,000 barrels of cask ale a year – is not without effort.</p><p>Nor is it necessarily permanent. Over the past 10 years, the Suffolk brewer has installed a range of resource efficiency measures to ensure its ongoing efficiency. As with many food and drinks companies, water comes high on the list. Southwold is located in East Anglia, the UK's driest region. Earlier this year, the county was subject to water restrictions as low rainfall threatened an extended drought.</p><p>\"As a mid-sized business, we need to keep an absolutely tight control over our costs,\" says Wood, highlighting a major driver for water-dependent industries.</p><p>The construction of a new distribution site and brewery in 2006 and 2007, respectively, gave Adnams the opportunity to upgrade its on-site water efficiencies. Rainwater harvesting and grey water recycling systems are now standard. Its anaerobic digester for wastewater veers closer to cutting-edge; it has linked the water inputs for its distillery and its brewery – essentially halving its water needs at a single stroke.</p><p>Today, Adnams uses around three pints of water for every pint of beer produced: that's almost half the industry average. Its water efficiency has caught the eye of some of the UK's big retailers, including Marks and Spencer. Under its <a href=\"http://plana.marksandspencer.com/\" title=\"\">Plan A</a> strategy, the high street retailer is seeking to cut its own water consumption. Innovations like sensor taps, flush valves and urinal controls are now finding their way into more than 300 M&amp;S stores.</p><h2>Economic is sustainable, too</h2><p>In-house measures are only part of the story. The bulk of the water footprint for big retailers occurs in their supply chains. A value chain analysis by the UK's largest supermarket, Tesco, found that its stores account for only 3% of its total water use.</p><p>In July, Anglian Water Business held the <a href=\"http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/business/global-water-challenge.aspx\" title=\"\">Global Water Challenge</a>: a major conference for companies and stakeholders to share strategic thinking on water use in the supply chain. Louise Nicholls, Head of Responsible Trading for Food at M&amp;S, spoke about the role of water in the responsible sourcing of food products, and the need for business to engage upstream. M&amp;S has committed to improving efficiency and stewardship in four parts of its supply chain that are particularly vulnerable to water stress: cotton production, dye houses, farming and food manufacture.</p><p>At the same event, Philip Hubert of specialist lettuce producer <a href=\"http://www.jepco.co.uk/\" title=\"\">JE Piccaver</a> (Jepco) described the company's significant investment in water efficiency, such as developing targeted irrigation techniques and installing rainwater storage. It is now looking to improve water use in offices, warehouses and packing centres. Hubert said: \"As is often the case when you do things for economic reasons, it turns out to be the sustainable route as well.\"</p><p>The case is particularly clear when it comes to agriculture, which of all global sectors is by far the largest user of water. As Marcus Norton, Head of Water and investor climate change programmes at the <a href=\"https://www.cdproject.net/en-US/Pages/HomePage.aspx\" title=\"\">Carbon Disclosure Project</a>, explains: \"Growing raw ingredients accounts for much more water than [food] processing or brewing. This is where much of the risk lies.\"</p><p>Addressing these supply-side risks calls for innovation. Experiments in drought-resilient crops provide a case in point. PepsiCo, for example, is researching water-efficient varieties of potato for use in crisp manufacture. In a similar vein, General Mills has been pioneering an advanced drip irrigation system with broccoli and cauliflower growers in Mexico.</p><p>Even more important than innovation, however, is collaboration. Multiple sectors are involved in using water, and they also need to be involved in conserving it. In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.wessexwater.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wessex Water</a> is working with farmers – on land outside its own catchment area – to reduce the amount of treatment groundwater needs due to the presence of pesticides and nitrates in the soil. These pollutants can be removed at specialised treatment plants, but building and operating them is both expensive and carbon-intensive. Such a plant was planned for Eagle Lodge, in Dorchester, but the need for it was overcome when farmers worked closely with a Wessex adviser to improve some elements of their practice, from manure management and the use of fertiliser to the drilling dates for crops.</p><p>Similarly, in Kenya, a multi-stakeholder education project supported by M&amp;S and Tesco is working with farmers and local residents to improve water stewardship at Lake Naivasha, the country's second-largest freshwater lake. The project aims to re-establish a healthy ecosystem in which plants and micro-organisms treat the water through natural processes, avoiding ground pollution.</p><h2>Good water stewardship</h2><p>For collaborative approaches to succeed, companies must win the hearts and minds of local people, insists Mike Barry, Head of Sustainable Business at M&amp;S: \"Of all the sustainability challenges that we face, water is the most location-specific. It defies one technology fix.\" With this in mind, the retailer has worked with environmental charity WWF to produce a 16-page guide to <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.marksandspencer.com%2Fdocuments%2Fpublications%2F2010%2Fgood_water_stewardship&amp;ei=UtO4UOaFOoPBhAfp14GQCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2RbHZ0XvY__LDQQKSsrnv-9SwIQ&amp;sig2=skX0Scftqmq85HZYK4jTYg&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Good Water Stewardship</a>. Its aim is to influence M&amp;S's global network of around 10,000 agricultural producers. The document clarifies the nature of water-related risks – physical, financial, political and reputational – and outlines strategies for engaging local partners.</p><p>Andrew Kuyk is Director of Sustainability and Competitiveness at the London-based <a href=\"http://www.fdf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Food and Drink Federation</a>. Asked for examples of locally-specific solutions, he points to Nestle in the Punjab. The Swiss food conglomerate is encouraging local dairy farmers in the north Indian state to intensify milk production and thereby reduce water use. A wider fodder area, more lactating cows and higher cow productivity are some of the ways in which this is being achieved.</p><p>In the same region, Nestle is working with the <a href=\"http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/\" title=\"\">International Water Management Institute</a> to minimise the water footprint of rice production. It takes 1,034m³ of irrigation water to produce a tonne of rice in the Punjab – almost twice that for dairy farming. Among the measures being implemented is laser-assisted land levelling, which reduces groundwater pumping by one-third while also improving rice yields.</p><p>Back in East Anglia, specialist lettuce producer Jepco is taking a high-tech approach. The firm has installed Enviroscan probes that detect electrical conductivity resistance to measure soil moisture during the entire growing period. The data can be monitored via computer or smartphone, and is then fed through into the mobile boom used for irrigation. The location and water use for each pull of the boom is subsequently recorded as well.</p><h2>Holistic approaches to water management</h2><p>Kuyk calls on businesses to take an integrated view of water-related risks and impacts across product lifecycles. Beverage giant Coca-Cola has opted for just such a strategy. Under its <a href=\"http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/press-centre/2010/march/the-coca-cola-company-and-usaid-expand-global-water-partnership.html\" title=\"\">Community Water Partnerships</a> programme, it's pursuing more than 300 community-based water replenishment projects in 86 countries. Further up the chain, water reduction measures in its factories have seen the water use ratio drop 16% since 2004, to 2.6 litres per litre of product. By the end of 2012, meanwhile, Coca Cola is requiring all its bottlers to have water management plans in place.</p><p>Dax Lovegrove, Head of Business and Industry at <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">WWF</a>, is also a strong advocate of holistic approaches to water management. To be successful, however, companies must have a clear idea of their impacts from the off. That requires a comprehensive assessment of water abstraction and pollution in critical river basins.</p><p>Among the examples he cites is that of global brewer <a href=\"http://www.sabmiller.com/\" title=\"\">SABMiller</a>. Back in 2009, the company worked with the environment group WWF and consultancy URS Corporation to map the water impacts of its businesses in South Africa and the Czech Republic. Anyone interested in water footprinting would do well to check out the methodology in the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CEMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sabmiller.com%2Ffiles%2Freports%2Fwater_footprinting_report.pdf&amp;ei=itW4ULqzEceDhQflr4Fg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGi4CW9jRv9vZ7bN066a8V9A031hQ&amp;sig2=DDfKGFfdi4lyw7rR0lMUhA&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">subsequent report</a>.</p><p>As Lovegrove concludes: \"Leading businesses understand this is less about water efficiency in isolation and more about understanding local situations and mobilising collective efforts to ensure water security for all: communities, wildlife, and industry.\"</p><p><em>This article also appears in a </em><a href=\"http://www.forumforthefuture.org/sites/default/files/images/GreenFutures/Water_Works/WaterWorks_spreads-lowres.pdf\" title=\"\"><em>special Water Works edition</em></a><em> of Forum for the Future's </em><a href=\"http://www.forumforthefuture.org/greenfutures\" title=\"\"><em>Green Futures </em></a><em>magazine.</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/30/1354292962365/A-pint-of-Adnams-ale-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/localism-water-security-food-drink-industry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/localism-water-security-food-drink-industry","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"Light pollution can benefit some wildlife, study shows","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-28T06:01:00Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2012/nov/28/light-pollution-wildlife","fields":{"body":"<p>Light pollution can have positive effects on some wildlife by helping migratory birds find more food at night, a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12012/abstract\">new study has shown</a>, contrasting with previous research which has emphasised the negative effects of artificial light.</p><p>A team from the University of Exeter studied how electrical lighting and gas flares affected the feeding habits of the <a href=\"http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob5460.htm\" title=\"\">common redshank</a> (<em>Tringa totanus</em>) in the Forth estuary, eastern Scotland.</p><p>The estuary's salt marsh and mudflats are home to hundreds of thousands of birds that migrate from the Arctic each winter, but is also a heavily industrialised area where Grangemouth oil refinery and Longannet power station are located.</p><p>The study found that at night, birds in areas that were continuously illuminated foraged for longer, and were able to locate food by sight, rather than touch, compared with those under darker night skies. This meant thay could stock up on more food to fuel their spring flight.</p><p>Ross Dwyer and three colleagues measured the moonlight and cloud cover against the amount of artificial light in the Forth estuary at night using <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/\" title=\"\">satellite images from the US Air Force</a> – the first time such technology has been used in animal behaviour research.</p><p>The team then worked out how the light affected the birds' foraging behaviour by attaching tiny radio transmitters to the backs of 20 redshanks. The devices monitored the birds' location and contained posture sensors to detect how often the birds put their heads down to feed on their diet of molluscs, worms and crustaceans.</p><p>The birds generally forage for food by sight during the day, which provides them with the most food. Feeding in the day for shorebirds during winter does not produce enough energy for them to survive, so many species are forced to feed less efficiently at night by locating prey through probing and sweeping the sand with their bills.</p><p>Dwyer said: \"Artificial light from industrial areas strongly influenced the foraging strategy of our tagged birds. It was as if the 24-hour light emitted from lamps and flares on the Grangemouth oil refinery site created, in effect, a perpetual full moon across the local inter-tidal area which the birds seemed to capitalise on by foraging for longer periods at night and switching to a potentially more effective foraging behaviour to locate prey.\"</p><p>Intertidal zones along exposed coastlines and estuaries provide essential habitat for migrating shorebirds, who spend winter feeding and building up their body reserves to make the return trip to summer breeding grounds. Every year millions of waterbirds arrive from the Arctic to UK coasts, but until now scientists have not known how these birds respond to the bright lights of coastal cities and industry.</p><p>Light pollution is more commonly thought to have negative effects on wildlife, particularly animals that move between the land and sea. Previous research found artificial light caused <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/dec/12/tourism-turtles-kenya-population\" title=\"\">newly hatched turtles to head away from the sea</a> and caused seabirds such as <a href=\"http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/34089/\" title=\"\">petrels to collide with lighthouses</a> and other lit structures.</p><p>Redshanks are medium-sized wading birds named for their long bright orange or red legs.

All eyes are on the dusty church floor, silent and respectful. When Muthee, chairman of Double K, began his speech, wearing a dark suit and a warm smile despite the intense heat, his companions could easily anticipate the story he would tell. Like a broken record, his story is familiar to many farmers in Nanyuki, on the emerald green foothills of Mount Kenya in the central part of the country.</p><p>It often starts with poor soil conditions or bad seeds, devastating pests and diseases, and extreme weather. If the farmers produce a yield worth selling, issues might arise about transport, particularly where road conditions are poor. Lack of available markets or buyers on the other end is also problematic. The story ends with severe debts owed to banks, suppliers of necessities like fertilisers, and even to the schools that the village children must leave when their parents cannot pay the tuition fees.</p><p>\"The farmers had started losing hope,\" says Muthee, whose story features all of the above. Today, however, a visit from the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture (SFSA) has caused a stir. SFSA has previously conducted a soil test on Double K land to help farmers better understand which fertiliser to use, so the organisation is liked and trusted by the farmers.</p><p>SFSA has given hope to farmers such as those in the Double K group. Its aims – to work with smallholder farmers to solve their farming problems and improve their livelihoods – are achieved primarily through the development of technology and education. It also forms partnerships with local smallholder farming groups and suppliers to achieve these goals.</p><p>One such supplier is Sunrise Agrovet, a shop in Nanyuki so colourful that, despite the clouds of dust kicked up by the traffic, you can see it from far away. Inside, Lucy Kabatha is sorting through packets of fertiliser. \"They love this one,\" she says, holding out a small packet. \"Everyone can afford it.\" The letters NPK are scattered here and there across boxes and bags. NPK stands for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, the main chemical components of fertiliser. Kabatha believes that through the development of technology, \"farmers can improve themselves, they can educate their kids, they can be [financially] stable, no matter what.\"</p><p>Research shows that the average distance between Kenyan farmers and their nearest fertiliser seller halved between 1997 and 2007, making fertiliser much more accessible. Crops often take longer than average to grow in high-altitude regions such as Nanyuki, so fertilisers that reduce the time taken from planting the seed to harvesting the crop are a blessing.</p><p>The boys at Thome secondary school are learning to solve the kind of problems faced by farmers. The school was founded by Samuel Mweri, who houses and educates destitute children. The boys attend standard classes as well as being taught how to manage the small farm, or shamba, that surrounds the school. They grow vegetables for their own consumption and keep animals. \"They are very smart,\" says Mweri, who is planning to have the greenhouse roof repaired after strong winds blew it apart. The crops inside the greenhouse, immaculate and well watered, are a testament to the children's farming skills as well as to people such as Mweri who dedicate their time and resources to development projects.</p><p>For many farmers, however, farming fruit and vegetables purely for sustenance does not offer a secure future, and selling their produce is the only option. Some choose to sell on the streets, which can involve long and expensive journeys to the nearest town. Others, such as Moses Mugambi, sell to exporters. Mugambi, chairman of the Lenana self-help group, a local farmer's collective, grows fine beans using natural fertiliser from farm animal manure, which he sells to Kenya Horticultural Exporters (KHE). Not only is using animal manure more cost-effective, but selling to exporters, who generally come to collect the produce themselves, means no travel costs are incurred, so Mugambi's farm is relatively efficient. The problems, however, do not end with the exporters.</p><p>KHE has to deal with stringent regulations imposed on exported goods. For example, beans have to meet certain specifications before they are packed by exporting companies to determine whether they are suitable for sale.</p><p>UK supermarkets typically have the most severe specifications, which result in up to 40% of produce being thrown away at the packing houses. It might fail to meet the required length – often by only a small margin – or be the \"wrong\" angle, weight or texture. In a country where the World Bank estimates 46% of the population lives below the poverty line, one could be forgiven for thinking that such wasteful and damaging policies might be on their way out, but sadly this is not the case.</p><p><strong>Hungry baboons</strong></p><p>Dean Summerton, general manager at KHE, has found a clever use for the excess produce. On the other side of the packing house and surrounding farmland lives a troop of baboons. Initially the baboons had caused problems, attempting to take produce from KHE land, and it was thought they would have to be killed. Instead, rejected produce is dumped on a plot of land near the farm. The baboons congregate there and, being satisfied with their feed, do not disturb the KHE farmers or packing house.</p><p>\"The future of Kenya is not about the big commercial farms,\" says Summerton, adding that, if they work together, smallholder farmers could produce more yield than commercial farmers. SFSA has 12 registered farmers' groups and is hoping to facilitate communications between them.</p><p>On the long road between Nanyuki and Nairobi, a crowd is kicking up dust on the roadside. The people are here to collect relief food, water, and medicine. As we drive on, it is hard not to think about Moses Mugambi, his 1990 Comic Relief T-shirt strikingly white against the black soil of his newly harvested maize plantation. A&nbsp;procession of NGOs has passed through Kenya in recent decades, but the country needs assistance that will encourage productivity, not dependency.

Large government donors, NGOs and the private sector believe girls could play a big role in resolving poverty and making development gains through ICT.</p><p><a href=\"http://plan-international.org/girls/pdfs/BIAAG_2010_EN2.pdf\" title=\"\">Girls consider ICT to be a major element in their personal growth</a> and development, useful for improving studies, staying informed and earning a living. They say it reduces their sense of isolation, help acquire new skills, actively participate in national and global dialogues, learn about taboo subjects (such as reproductive health and HIV), and makes them feel safer and more in touch with family and friends, and strengthens self-esteem. They also feel ICT helps them improve their ability to express themselves, speak in public, and engage with adults and other decision makers to negotiate their needs and rights.</p><h2>Provide access</h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p>For many girls, access and use of ICT remains a huge challenge. Gender discrimination, lack of confidence, language barrier, low literacy, lack of time and money, restricted mobility due to cultural factors or safety often prevent girls from taking advantage of ICT.</p><p>Despite increased availability of mobile phones and internet worldwide, access is often characterised in broad economic terms –  'developing' v 'developed' countries, or analysed at country level: Kenya v Mozambique. <a href=\"http://lindaraftree.com/2012/10/04/mobile-phones-toilets-and-libraries-beyond-access/\" title=\"\">Analysis</a>,rather, should include factors like class and wealth status, gender, geographic location, age, disability, literacy, language, and device ownership.</p><p>Girls living in the same area may have very different levels of access. An English-speaking Kenyan girl living in an urban high rise with her upper class parents will have more access to ICT than a non-English speaking Kenyan girl with low literacy levels who works long hours cleaning that same apartment and lives in a slum. Similarly, the daughter of a local business man and community leader in a village can own a mobile phone but one whose family is poor cannot.</p><p>Gender discrimination also comes into play, and in places where men and boys dominate women and girls, they also tend to dominate the available ICT.  In places where boys are more favoured, their confidence to try new things will tend to be higher. Girls often report that boys monopolise ICT equipment and criticise, scorn and ridicule girls who are using equipment for the first time, making them feel too timid to try again.</p><p>How can development agencies help girls overcome these barriers?</p><h2>Address the underlying causes </h2><p>If girls and women continue to live in greater poverty, with lower education levels, less access to healthcare and other services, less opportunity to work, and lower status in their societies, chances are that their access and use of ICT will not match that of boys and men.</p><p>Getting more girls into school and improving the quality of education could help more girls access and learn to use technology. Finding ways to encourage critical thinking and innovation within the education system and ways for girls to join extra-curricular activities to stimulate new ways of thinking could also help them gain skills for jobs in the ICT sector.</p><p>NGOs should advocate and support policies to make internet more accessible and affordable. Libraries and other safe spaces can also help girls and women feel more comfortable to access information and learn how to use technology.</p><h2>Change attitudes</h2><p>To make it possible for girls to participate fully in their family and communities and at broader levels requires a shift in thinking: social behaviours and attitudes needs to be changed.</p><p>Organisations should engage men and boys as allies in this process. When fathers and male peers are aware, engaged and supportive of girls' development and their rights, they play a very strong role in changing broader norms and perceptions.</p><p>Female role models can also help change mentalities. Having a device or new technology in their possession can increase the status and strength of girls and women as role models and enable them to carry out different and important roles in the community.</p><h2>Offer opportunities</h2><p>Offer specific support and opportunities. ICT offers incredible tools for engaging students in the classroom, making teaching more participatory. It encourages student-led research and builds critical media and digital literacy skills in the process. In places where textbooks are old and outdated, the internet can offer ways to connect with current events and up-to-date research.</p><p>Adding gadgets to the classroom experience involves more than just having the latest digital devices – consider teaching goals, desired outcomes, and issues like relevance and sustainability before deciding on tools and devices.</p><p>Special care needs to be taken to ensure that girls have equal access to equipment. Where ICT cannot be integrated into the classroom or where girls are not in school, it can be brought to them through non-formal education and extra-curricular activities.</p><p><em>Linda Raftree works as the senior ICT4D advisor at </em><a href=\"http://www.planusa.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Plan International USA</em></a><em>.

It's a similar story in India, which already has 70 subscriptions per 100 people, with 53% of households owning a mobile phone.</p><p>The SMS function offered by even the most basic handset can be used to provide data to farmers that they previously would not have had access to. Instant updates on weather and wholesale crop prices, for example, can improve productivity and negotiating positions. A <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTINFORMATIONANDCOMMUNICATIONANDTECHNOLOGIES/Resources/IC4D-2012-Chapter-2.pdf\">World Bank report</a> earlier this year described mobile networks as \"a unique and unparalleled opportunity to give rural smallholders access to information that could transform their livelihoods\".</p><p>But who is driving this, and how? One trend in recent years has been the growth of large-scale, branded commercial SMS services for farmers. Reuters Market Light and Nokia Life both offer subscription-based services to farmers, using SMS to send information on crop prices, weather conditions, and general farming tips. <a href=\"http://www.reutersmarketlight.com/milestones.html\">Reuters Market Light</a> claims to have 1 million registered users across 50,000 villages in India, while Nokia Life reports that <a href=\"http://press.nokia.com/2012/09/25/nokia-debuts-nokia-life-for-millions-of-consumers-ready-to-experience-a-smarter-internet/\">76 million people</a> had \"experienced\" its service in India, China, Indonesia and Nigeria by August 2012.</p><p>Encouraged by the demand, India's <a href=\"http://www.nabard.org/\" title=\"\">National Agricultural and Rural Development Bank (Nabard)</a> announced a <a href=\"http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-04/pune/33580668_1_advisory-services-farmers-nabard\">pilot project</a> of its own in September 2012, offering a free service to more than 50,000 farmers in the state of Maharashtra.</p><p>At the other end of the scale, there are dozens of smaller, locally-grown projects delivering SMS services to farmers. <a href=\"http://kiwanja.net/\" title=\"\">Kiwanja.net</a> offers an open-source tool – FrontlineSMS – which was designed as a free SMS communications system for development projects and has been used effectively in very specific contexts:  pastoralists in northern Kenya have used it to access local crop and livestock prices, for example. Its founder, Ken Banks, sees the greatest development value emerging out of these local applications. \"Conditions are often different between regions and an all-purpose, blanket service doesn't always provide the most accurate or useful information to local farmers,\" he says. \"Prices vary considerably, and access to markets provides different levels of challenge.\"</p><p>Banks identifies trust as another key issue: if farmers already know an NGO providing an SMS service,  they are more likely to trust the information. \"The NGO will likely better know the history, conditions and challenges of the area, and be better placed to collect and provide more accurate advice on cropping, crop disease, markets, market prices, and so on.\"</p><p>Reuters Market Light does provide very localised data, but remains broadly a top-down style of information delivery. This needn't be the case: development projects can just as easily use SMS technology as a collaborative tool. Kenya's <a href=\"http://mfarm.co.ke/\">M-Farm</a>, for instance, charges farmers 10 Kenyan shillings (7p) to simply check local market prices by SMS, but it also has a feature that enables them to band together to buy and sell collectively, empowering them within the supply chain.</p><p>The technology can also capture and share farmers' existing knowledge. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDS), for example, is funding a <a href=\"http://wiki.epfl.ch/csn2\">collaborative SMS-based project</a> between the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, and an Indian NGO, the Chennakeshava Trust, in which participating farmers are actively involved in providing data.</p><p>\"It's about 20% delivery of information, such as weather and prices,\" says Hendrik Knoche, the project developer at EPFL. \"The rest of the information shared is based on data entered by the farmers, on the varieties they sow, their use of fertiliser, irrigation, spraying, harvesting, and selling, including the price achieved.  The data entered is shared with other farmers so they can find out more about fertilizer and pesticide use from their peers.\"</p><p>As mobile networks expand, so too are associated services such as mobile payment systems. This is opening up new avenues for using SMS to deliver ancillary services to farmers, going beyond price and weather data to allow the purchase of microinsurance, for example.</p><p><a href=\"http://kilimosalama.wordpress.com/\">Kilimo Salama</a>, a microinsurance programme developed by the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture, allows farmers to insure a $2 bag of seeds for 10 cents – using their phone. Farmers buy the insurance from a local stockist who scans a quick-response code; the farmer then gets an SMS with the policy number. The system is linked to the M-Pesa mobile payment system, so when a payout is due, farmers receive it directly by SMS. To date Kilimo Salama (Swahili for \"safe farming\") has insured 73,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda.</p><p>Co-founder Rose Goslinga sees the system as giving small-scale farmers the confidence to grow big. \"Making investments without covering risks that could endanger a good harvest is something that farmers are very aware of, and makes them wary of investing at all,\" she says. \"Climate change has added to that, making farmers more aware of risks as rains seem more erratic than before.\"</p><p>The next stage, inevitably, will be a switch to smartphones, with camera and GPS features potentially strengthening small-scale farmers even further. In October 2012, Samsung announced plans for a major push on smartphone devices in sub-Saharan Africa – but it may be a few years before they reach rural producers.</p><p>\"SMS tools require little training, but expecting a farmer to install an app relies on him knowing how to do this from some other activity,\" says Goslinga. \"That said, the new generation of farmers definitely know how to download a song, so if app developers can make insurance apps as simple and attractive as that, it could work.\"</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Its main function is the creation, promotion and regulation of employment abroad to ensure a steady flow of remittances. Haiti and Senegal have established ministerial positions for dealing exclusively with diaspora issues.</p><p></p><p>In Senegal, the <a href=\"http://www.rfcd.net/projects/8/\" title=\"\">Local Collective Development Projects</a> has provided technical assistance for 221 projects in agriculture, tourism and other sectors. Half of them were undertaken by diaspora members who remained in France, while the others were implemented by investors who returned permanently to oversee their projects.</p><p></p><p>However, most LDCs do not give these issues enough weight within government, and deal with them at lower than ministerial levels, said Unctad.</p><p></p><p>Remittances to developing countries are an important source of funding. Officially recorded remittances to developing countries are expected to reach <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1288990760745/MigrationDevelopmentBrief19.pdf\" title=\"\">$406bn this year, according to the World Bank</a>, although the true size, including unrecorded flows, is believed to be significantly larger. The bank says remittance flows to poor countries are three times larger than official development assistance (ODA).</p><p></p><p>One of the key issues is the cost of transfer fees, said Unctad. For LDCs, the average cost of remitting was close to 12% of the amount sent, 30% higher than the international average, with the most expensive channels in Africa. Remittances sent to sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 could have generated an additional $6bn for recipients if remittance costs had matched the global average, according to estimates.</p><p></p><p>Unctad said African governments could reduce costs by opening the market to more remittance companies instead of signing exclusivity arrangements with firms such as MoneyGram and Western Union, which control 65% of all remittance locations in Africa despite the emergence of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jul/23/somaliland-towards-news-banking-era\" title=\"\">new players such as Dahabshiil</a>.</p><p></p><p>\"We would like to see greater service provision, more partnerships between banks and microfinance, [and] we'd like to see post offices more involved. But in most African countries, the financial sector is small and weak,\" said Junior Davis, one of the report's authors.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jul/24/mobile-phones-africa-microfinance-farming\" title=\"\">The explosion in the use of mobile phones in Africa</a> holds some promise in cutting remittance costs but, as of early 2012, only 20% of 130 mobile banking operators such as G-Cash in the Philippines and M-Pesa in Kenya and Tanzania offered international remittance services. Mobile remittances have not taken off, said the World Bank, because they fall in the regulatory void between finance and telecommunications. Many central banks do not allow non-bank companies to conduct mobile transactions or cash money at an agent.</p><p></p><p>Besides sending back money, the diaspora could provide valuable skills as entrepreneurs and trade networks, said Unctad. For example, Oromo refugees from Ethiopia in Britain developed the Oromo Coffee Company, which appealed to a wide market. Ethiopia is also using diaspora bonds, which offer attractive interest rates, to raise money for infrastructure projects, <a href=\"http://www.waltainfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1038&amp;Itemid=141\" title=\"\">particularly dams</a>.</p><p></p><p>A first step for many LDCs could be to try to tap the potential of its diaspora by exporting goods emblematic of home but hard to find in the host country.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Unctad said LDCs should emulate countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and India, which have successfully used diaspora networks to transfer skills and knowledge. India granted generous incentives to diaspora investors who actively promoted and supported the  software sector in the late 1990s. At a minimum these networks can partly offset the huge knowledge gap created by the brain drain, when university-educated people leave. These networks could help the state in linking local firms with foreign ones to address specific bottlenecks and shortages.</p><p></p><p>LDCs should adopt a proactive diaspora policy to ensure these essentially private voluntary networks gain the trust and confidence to commit to their countries of origin, the report says. Indian policies, for example, did not focus on the return of diaspora members but highlighted the importance of international networks that linked professionals overseas with those in India, helping to develop India's information and communications industry.</p><p></p><p>Unctad cautioned, however, that remittances should not be considered a substitute for foreign direct investment, ODA, debt relief or the mobilisation of internal resources. Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, Unctad's secretary-general, added: \"LDCs will likely be hard hit by the global economic slowdown. This will require rethinking alternative sources of knowledge, entrepreneurship and trade links.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/11/26/1353938372268/MDG--Remittance--Gibe-III-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/nov/26/poor-countries-remittances-diaspora","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/nov/26/poor-countries-remittances-diaspora","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Learning to save lives in Uganda","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-26T00:01:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"journalismcompetition/learning-save-lives-uganda","fields":{"body":"<p>Grace Aguti gives one final push. She leans back exhausted on the plastic mattress and listens for her baby's cry, but there is only silence. Her eyes flash with panic as she looks down and sees the umbilical cord wrapped tightly around her baby's neck, its tiny body slowly turning blue.</p><p>Using the last surgical gloves in stock, the midwife effortlessly clamps and cuts the cord to free the baby, rushing it to the examining table. After a few tense moments, high-pitched cries echo around the dimly lit labour room and a tearful Aguti lets out a cry of relief.</p><p>Giving birth in Uganda can be a matter of life and death. Luckily, 37-year-old Aguti was with a midwife who knew what to do when something went wrong. Many women and babies in Uganda are not so fortunate, and, for every 100,000 live births there, 430 mothers die.</p><p>The African Medical and Research Foundation (Amref) warns that without more sufficiently skilled midwives in Uganda, the fifth millennium development goal of reducing maternal mortality rates by 2015 will not be met. Only 38% of the 11,759 midwives in Uganda are fully registered and qualified to diploma level. Amref believes this should be 100%.</p><p>The midwife presents the healthy baby boy to his eagerly awaiting mother, who smiles contentedly. \"I have a lot of pain but I am very happy,\" she says. \"The baby I had before this one died in the village when he&nbsp;was born and I bled for many weeks, so this time I came to the midwife. When I knew the baby was coming I travelled here on the back of a bicycle. It took over an hour.\"</p><p>There is little privacy in the Tiriri health centre IV, in Soroti, eastern Uganda. Aguti shares the small ward with a dozen other women who lie on beds with no sheets or curtains, inches away from one another.</p><p>Midwife Esther Madudu scans the ward. \"If the cord had wrapped around the baby in the village, or somewhere with a less-qualified midwife, the people assisting the birth would not have had the skills to unravel it. The baby most certainly would have died,\" she says.</p><p>But despite a lack of well-trained midwives in Uganda, many find it difficult to afford to take unpaid study leave and move away from their families for further training. This leaves thousands without the advanced skills required to deal with more complicated cases.</p><p>As a result, Amref is using e-learning to train more midwives to diploma level, the first time this has been done in Uganda. Midwives study in their spare time and put what they learn into practice at work. Critically, this means that they are not leaving a gap in healthcare services by temporarily vacating their jobs for training.</p><p>So far, the programme has attracted 73&nbsp;midwives who would otherwise be unable to do further training. However, many of the students are struggling to get to grips with the computers they need to use to complete their studies, and unreliable electricity and internet connections are an issue.</p><p>\"Computers are a new thing for me,\" says Amref student, Jackeline Kobusingye. \"E-learning is a big challenge and access to a computer is a problem. Some are broken and sometimes there is no power.\"</p><p>Whether technological innovation can succeed without basic infrastructure, such as electricity, is up for debate. However, the challenges of infrastructure and technology should not get in the way of innovation, argues Nicholas Tembo, the district education officer for Arua, in north-west Uganda, one of the regions where the e-learning programme is being piloted.</p><p>Tembo says: \"We cannot hide our heads in the sand. The globe is now a village where everything is online and this is the way we need to move. E-learning is a wonderful new method of studying in Uganda, making students responsible for their own education. Secondary schools here use solar power for computers. Surely they can share them with midwives? It is about forming partnerships. We are learning from the challenges and we can overcome them.\"</p><p><strong>Transport problems </strong></p><p>There are still many other basic obstacles to reducing maternal death rates in Uganda, for example, many women do not even have the means to travel to a health clinic should something go wrong during their pregnancy. However, Amref believes e-learning will at least play a vital role in improving the standard and number of&nbsp;midwives.</p><p>The charity's approach has already proved successful in other countries. Amref's e-learning project manager, Eva Musimenta, says: \"In Kenya, we used e-learning to train more than 7,000 nurses in five years, so we know it is possible. Once we have piloted the programme and dealt with the challenges, we hope to roll out e-learning across other districts in Uganda, to train even more midwives across all skill levels and significantly reduce maternal mortality rates.\"</p><p>Back in the Tiriri health centre IV, another woman has started to deliver. She moans heavily on her bed as children play around her. Aguti will be taking little Peter home in a couple of hours.

Today, those bags are nowhere in sight. \"It's great,\" agrees Alex Wekesa, a 26-year-old businessman who runs two 3ft-by-5ft Fresh Life toilets in the alley.</p><p>The toilets are made by <a href=\"http://saner.gy/\" title=\"\">Sanergy</a>, a Kenya-based social enterprise, and sold to individuals for around $500 each. A 14-strong \"Fresh Life frontline\" team collects the waste each day and takes it to a processing site, where it is turned into organic fertiliser.</p><p>The first toilet was launched on <a href=\"http://www.worldtoiletday.org/\" title=\"\">world toilet day</a> last November, and there are now over 100 in Mukuru. Fresh Life operators receive business training, field support and supplies including a mop, bucket and solar lantern. This year, to mark world toilet day, Sanergy organised a football tournament and a concert by local performers as well as Kenyan artists <a href=\"http://ericwainaina.com/\" title=\"\">Eric Wainaina</a> and Burundian drummer Kidum.</p><p>\"The small difference we are making is great,\" says Ochieng, operations and impact manager for Sanergy, which plans to have 1,000 toilets here by 2015.</p><p>Wekesa has had his toilets for about three months and gets around 50 daily customers, mostly women. He charges four shillings (around four US cents) per adult, and two shillings for children. He hopes to make enough money to buy extra machines for his dry-cleaning business. \"The cleanliness is the main thing [the customers] like. The soap is there, the water is there,\" says Wekesa, who is wearing a T-shirt with the Fresh Life motto: Be you. Be clean. Be fresh. His female customers really appreciate the mirror on the toilet door, he adds.</p><p>In September, <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org/updates/kiva/2012/09/17/new-field-partner-sanergy-turns-waste.html\" title=\"\">Sanergy entered into a partnership</a> with <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org/\" title=\"\">Kiva</a>, a web-based non-profit group that facilitates micro-lending, to help would-be operators buy its toilets.</p><p>Around 60% of Nairobi's residents live in slums, which occupy less than 6% of the city's residential land. Services such as sewerage, piped water and rubbish collections are virtually non-existent here, meaning that the poorest people have to pay for things wealthier residents take for granted. There are privately operated pit latrines in Mukuru, which people pay around two shillings to use, but they are often dirty, smelly and have no paper or water.</p><p>There is also a security issue, especially for women needing to go to the toilet at night. In a 2010 report, <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR32/006/2010\" title=\"\">Risking rape to reach a toilet</a> (pdf), Amnesty International surveyed 130 women living in four slums in Nairobi, including Mukuru, and found that: \"The shortage of toilets (including latrines) and places to wash in the slums exacerbates women's insecurity and heightens the risk of gender-based violence.\"</p><p>Amnesty said most slum residents use pit latrines, with 50 to 150 people sharing one facility. There are also community toilets, but some are closed at night. \"Many women have suffered rape and other forms of violence as a result of attempting to walk to a toilet or latrine some distance from their home,\" the report said.</p><p>Amnesty said landlords in the slums neglect the sanitary needs of their tenants, preferring to maximise incomes by building more homes rather than toilets or bathrooms.</p><p>As part of its commitment to the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\" title=\"\">UN millennium development goals</a> (MDGs), Kenya agreed to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to sanitation between 1990 and 2015. But Amnesty says that, by failing to address the needs of women in informal settlements, the government is likely to miss its target.</p><p>Kenya is not alone: advocacy group <a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org/\" title=\"\">WaterAid</a> says the MDG sanitation goal is likely to be missed by a huge margin. \"The majority of developing countries are seriously off-track and, unless urgent action is taken now, sub-Saharan Africa will not meet the target for over 150 years,\" it <a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org/documents/Saving_Lives_Notes_Final.pdf\" title=\"\">said in April</a> (pdf).</p><p>Sanergy co-founder Lindsay Stradley, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan school of management and a former Google employee, says she was motivated to start the scheme by her desire to tackle urban poverty. Sanitation, she says, lies at the heart of that mission.</p><p>\"The more people are healthy, the more they are able to work and be productive, the more their children are able to go to school … if you have to walk very far to access sanitation, that takes a lot of your time. There is a huge security risk that goes along with that, which has … huge psychological and public health effects,\" Stradley says.</p><p>Sanergy's main advantage, says communications officer Kate Rose, is that it adds value all along the chain, thanks to its waste processing. \"No one else is really doing that in this area,\" she says. Fresh Life toilets have urine-diverting squat slabs to separate solid waste from liquid. This reduces the smell and makes collection easier. At the processing centre, solid waste is placed in large wooden boxes for composting, while the urine is placed in plastic containers and left in the sun, which burns off the pathogens. Sanergy is developing a biogas chamber to produce electricity.</p><p>One of the problems faced by Sanergy as it pushes to expand is the <a href=\"http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2012/01/pm-orders-halt-to-slum-demolitions/\" title=\"\">fear of demolitions in Mukuru</a>, where a woman and child died in January when police tried to evict people from land said to belong to a steel company. Across Nairobi, slum dwellers with no security of tenure face the threat of forced evictions, often with little or no notice, despite a clause in <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.go.ke%2Findex.php%3Foption%3Dcom_docman%26task%3Ddoc_download%26gid%3D460%26Itemid&amp;ei=6-aYUOCNEYu6hAfNh4GADA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF95LT6uUoMtD2aghW0IW6WGK6PPg\" title=\"\">the 2010 constitution</a> (pdf) guaranteeing the right to \"accessible and adequate housing, and to reasonable standards of sanitation\".</p><p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is encouraging innovation in waterless, hygienic toilets that do not need to be connected to a sewer through its <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/watersanitationhygiene/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Reinvent the toilet challenge</a>, and has so far <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/watersanitationhygiene/Documents/wsh-strategy-overview.pdf\" title=\"\">invested around $6.5m</a> (pdf). The foundation says that every year, food and water tainted with faecal matter cause up to 2.5bn cases of diarrhoea among children under five, resulting in 1.5m deaths.</p><p>For Stradley, turning the sanitation problem on its head, so that it becomes an investment possibility, is the future. \"Provision of sanitation is historically a huge cost centre for governments, for NGOs, for private individuals. [If you] flip that upside down to make it a source of revenue, which becomes not just self-sustaining but actually creates jobs and opportunity … that … is what's most exciting,\" she says.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/11/6/1352204905082/MDG-Kenya--Sanitation--To-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/nov/19/flying-toilets-fertiliser-slum-sanitation-nairobi","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/nov/19/flying-toilets-fertiliser-slum-sanitation-nairobi","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Nigeria's BlackBerry addiction offers hope for Research in Motion","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-15T09:13:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2012/nov/14/blackberry-nigeria-status-symbol","fields":{"body":"<p>\"What's your BB pin?\"</p><p>The question is the ultimate social status badge for many young, urban Nigerians. Standing in front of a row of gleaming BlackBerry handsets in a Lagos phone shop, sales assistant Remi Olajuwon explained: \"The average Nigerian has a very healthy interest in status and luxury. So if somebody asks for your BlackBerry pin and you don't have one&nbsp;…\" she trailed off with a dismissive flick of her false eyelashes.</p><p>Retailing at between $200 (£126) and $2,000 in a country where most live on less than $2 a day, the cost alone made it a status symbol, she added. \"People come in to buy one just to show they've been promoted.\"</p><p>Amid sagging sales in Europe and North America, developing markets offer a ray of hope for Research in Motion (RIM), after the maker of BlackBerry posted a $235m loss for the latest quarter. In Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt, Africa's three biggest economies, BlackBerrys outsold smartphone competitors this quarter. Kenya and Ghana also had buoyant sales, officials said.</p><p>Around one sixth of Africa's 620 million active phone subscribers come from Nigeria. Half of Nigeria's 4 million smartphone owners use BlackBerrys, and use among the wealthiest segment of society is forecast to increase sixfold by 2016.</p><p>\"There's a misconception Africans only want cheap phones [but] Nigeria is a key market for us. We're seen as an aspirational product,\" said RIM regional director Waldi Wepenerlast month, after the company opened its first Nigerian store in Lagos's computer village, a sprawling haven for tech junkies.</p><p>With its <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/technology/blackberry-becomes-a-source-of-shame-for-users.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">image increasingly outdated </a>elsewhere, RIM hopes to capitalise on Nigeria's twin obsessions with status and communication. BlackBerry-related dramas flood newspapers' agony aunt pages. On social websites, debate rages as to whether a bride photographed using her phone during her wedding ceremony was reading an e-Bible, or was merely a BlackBerry addict. The Nollywood film industry, whose clunkily named movie titles are a good cultural barometer and include delights such as the \"Fazebook Babes\" series, has recently spawned the hit multisequel \"BlackBerry Babes\". The comedy follows a group of scantily clad university girls obsessed with getting the latest phones.</p><p>The popularity of BlackBerrys in Nigeria is partly born of necessity. Erratic internet services and a nonexistent landline network are plugged by unlimited data bundles, costing about £12 a month. Unpredictable phone networks force those who can afford it to own two handsets.</p><p>\"I already have another smartphone, but I need a BlackBerry pin number to socialise with friends and get babes. BlackBerry has an edge because of the pinging,\" George Emeka, a university student said, using the colloquial term for its instant messaging service.</p><p>Others are getting more bang for their buck. Yahya Balogun, who lives in a Lagos slum, used eight months of savings to buy a secondhand model. The taxi driver has caught on to the growing number of high-end businesses who advertise and communicate using BlackBerry pin numbers as well as traditional means. \"All my clients in [upmarket district] Victoria Island own BlackBerrys. It is a good investment,\" Balogun said.</p><p>In his rundown district where extended families squeeze into single rooms, neighbours frequently browse on his phone. \"My daughter can use the internet [for schoolwork],\" said neighbour Tosin Alabi, his face lit by the screen's blue glow during a recent powercut. \"Personally myself I can never pay 1,000 naira [£4] every week for internet. And the battery is terrible when I can go for two days without charging my own phone,\" he added, indicating a battered Nokia feature phone.</p><p>Nokia's low-cost phones remain the top overall sellers across Africa, though affordable mid-range mobiles could also erode RIM's top-end dominance, analysts say. Last year, Chinese manufacturer Huawei gobbled up almost half of Kenya's smartphone market with the launch of its $100 devices powered by Google's Android software. RIM has felt the heat in South Africa, where, unlike Nigeria, mobile carriers offer packages with Apple iPhones. \"You're only with it if you have an iPhone, preferably the iPhone 5, or Samsung Galaxy SIII,\" said Khayakazi Mgojo, based in Pretoria.</p><p>A three-day loss of service across Africa and parts of Europe last year was the final straw for some. \"I switched because BlackBerry was frustrating me with all its constant freezing at the most inconvenient times, short battery life and the daily reboots,\" Mgojo said. Nevertheless she added: \"I still use it for social network because it's cheap compared to buying data bundles.\"</p><p>RIM hopes to bat away growing competition in its most important African markets by releasing its jazzed up BlackBerry 10 software in South Africa and Nigeria at the same time as other global markets next year. \"At a time when Nokia is strengthening its distribution arm in Nigeria and Apple has recently appointed its first official distributor … the opening of the first BlackBerry-branded retail store is a logical step [to remain] the country's No 1 smartphone vendor,\" said Nick Jotischky, an analyst with Informa Telecoms &amp; Media.</p><p>And for the consumer there still seems a popular groundswell for RIM's best known product. Manzo George, a businessman who owns three BlackBerrys, said he had no plans to switch over to an Android phone anytime soon. \"When people ask me why not try a new brand smartphone, I tell them there are smartphones and then there are BlackBerrys.\"</p><h2>Outsmarted</h2><p>The once mighty BlackBerry is no longer a status symbol in western markets, but RIM hopes for a revival on 30 January with the release of its new operating system, BlackBerry 10.</p><p>Caught in the crossfire between Apple and Android, RIM has lost market share. Its devices excel at email and instant messaging, making them popular with younger users who cannot afford big phone bills, but the company has been left behind because of its failure to create a smartphone that can efficiently navigate the wider web.</p><p>RIM's worldwide market share stood at nearly 20% in 2009, says research firm Gartner, but has now fallen to 5%. While smartphone sales are booming, RIM's shipment volumes have fallen 57% in a year, according to IDC resaerch. In June the firm reported its first operating loss since 2004, and set out plans to shrink its headcount by a third, shedding 5,000 jobs.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/11/14/1352921933767/A-delegate-checks-a-Black-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/14/blackberry-nigeria-status-symbol","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2012/nov/14/blackberry-nigeria-status-symbol","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Bono turns up the volume for social enterprise","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-14T11:18:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"social-enterprise-network/2012/nov/14/social-enterpise-bono-georgetown","fields":{"body":"<p>\"Thank you very much.

I do not, I don't even know where I am at…</p><p>The first existential question of this class might be, \"what am I doing in Healy Hall?\" I could be down having my third pint down at The Tombs?</p><p>Pop culture references? Rockstar does research!</p><p>I hear election night was quite messy on the pint front…</p><p>Isn't it amazing how three can make everything seem like a victory… but four or five, well, you just know you're about to taste defeat.</p><p>Anyway, congratulations are in order. Not just for turning out in record numbers… and forgetting politics for a minute, for electing an extraordinary man as president, I think you have to say that, whatever your political tradition. But also, you are finally free from the tyranny of negative advertising from both sides.</p><p>The attack ads…</p><p>Could you bear any more of it by the end? Can you imagine what it would be like if we did this for everything, you know, all the time? Attack ads about TV shows, rival smart phone companies… college admissions?</p><p>\"Hello, we're Georgetown, and we approve this message.\"</p><p>\"Let me say a few words about some of the other fine schools you might be considering…\"</p><p>\"UVA: Thomas Jefferson, what have they done to you…\"</p><p>\"Syracuse: a school whose mascot is a fruit??\"</p><p>\"Duke: a school that worships the devil.\"</p><p>\"Georgetown you're in with the other guy.\"</p><p>Georgetown has God on its side… Everyone knows God is a Catholic, right?</p><p>Two words: Frank Sinatra. That proves it?</p><p>Anyway, I've been hanging round with politicians more than I should admit, but I guess I don't really get these ads and I don't really understand politics in that form, actually.</p><p>I'd like to hear attack ads on things worth attacking.</p><p>If there was an attack ad on malaria, I'd get that, because 3,000 people die every day, mostly kids, from malaria.</p><p>There hasn't been an attack ad on malaria.</p><p>There hasn't been an attack ad on mother-to-child transmission of HIV, I'd get that…</p><p>Choose your enemies carefully… Because they define you.</p><p>Make sure they're interesting enough, because, trust me, you're going to spend a lot of time in their company…</p><p>So let's pick a worthwhile enemy. How about all obstacles in the way of fulfilling human potential? Not just yours or mine but the world's potential?</p><p>I would suggest to you that the biggest obstacle in the way right now is extreme poverty.</p><p>Poverty so extreme it brutalizes, vandalizes human dignity…</p><p>Poverty so extreme it laughs at the concept of equality…</p><p>Poverty so extreme it doubts how far we've traveled in our journey of equality… the journey that began with Wilbeforce taking on slavery and will not end till it's misery and deprivation are in the stocks…</p><p>Abolitionists and Suffragettes… civil rights workers and human rights activists… Social movements have always been powerful… but the subject of my speechifying tonight is going to point out what is transformative element about this moment, this generation, and the chance you have to rid the world of the obscenity of extreme poverty.</p><p>Wouldn't that be one hell of a way to start the 21st century…</p><p>Now the history department might disagree with me, and I'll admit, I only lasted a few weeks at college — but I don't believe the 21st century started in the year 2000, on January 1; for large parts of the world I think it just started… in 2011, with the upheaval of the Arab Spring.</p><p>What happened in Egypt was that the pyramid—the traditional model of power—got inverted. The people at the top got upended… and the base had its say.</p><p>Now, the Arab Spring is ongoing, its messy, it's dangerous, and dangerously wrong in some geographies… but what I'm talking about is bigger than Egypt or anyplace else. It's a massive shift… It's one of those moments that in a hundred years, the real historians, like those at Georgetown will write about this phenomenon in the history books.</p><p>The base of the pyramid… the 99%… is taking more control. The institutions that have always governed our lives… church… state… the mainstream media… the music industry… are being bypassed and weakened and seriously tested. People are holding them to account… Us to account… demanding that they become more open, more responsive, more effective. Or else.</p><p>Here in the US you've had the Tea Party hammering big government. You had Occupy do the same to the jolly bankers of Wall Street… Social movements are competing, and we have to hope the more enlightened ones will win the day.</p><p>Social movements like the ONE Campaign, we're 3.2 million at last count, asking the world to pay attention to the least amongst us, the very poorest of the world's poor, and the many things we can do to help them.</p><p>As I'll describe we see things are happening in the developing world. But think about this particular moment. Not just Facebook in the heat of Tahrir Square, but the peaceful march across the world of the mobile phones… across the parched lands of the Sahel and the dense rainforest of the Congo… Technology is transforming things.</p><p>Everything's speeding up… and opening up.</p><p>Now if I can talk about something I actually know about for a moment, this feeling reminds me a little bit, maybe even more than a little bit, of the arrival of punk rock in the mid-70s… You see, The Clash were the very base of the rock and roll pyramid, and overnight gave the finger to the dreadful business, the lergy of the time, that was at the top of the pyramid. It was called progressive rock.</p><p>Epic songs. No good lyrics. No good hooks. Great reviews.</p><p>Punk bands made no pretense of being better than the audience—punk bands were the audience. If you wanted to play—great, grab a guitar, you're in the band. Virtuosity was out. Energy was in.</p><p>The Clash were like a public service announcement… with guitars.</p><p>And they gave U2 the idea that social activism could make for a very musical riot.</p><p>So I'd just like to point out that none of your professors, not a single one, not ever, has drawn this connection… or is likely to draw… the connection between the Arab Spring… and The Clash.</p><p>Just a little intermission.</p><p>Okay. Sharpen your pencils.</p><p>I don't need to lecture you about change.</p><p>Change is part of the air you breathe. You are it … I think, your expectation.</p><p>[pause]</p><p>But what it might mean for you when the pyramid—and a whole lot else—gets turned on its head. What a huge opportunity that affords you—if you're willing to seize it. Because there's not just one big lever of power anymore; there's millions of levers, and you've got some in your hands. When we press 'em together… at the same time… that's when things really start happening.</p><p>But first let me hit the brakes—before some of you do.</p><p>Let's just acknowledge that it's brutal out there. It's brutal out there. And by \"there\" I mean \"here,\" right here in America. The economy is still in rough shape. And that slashing sound you hear is a big pair of scissors—bearing down on the federal budget. Defense cuts, safety net cuts, foreign aid cuts, all these cuts coming if we drive over this fiscal cliff, so called.</p><p>And cuts… they hurt. Somebody bleeds. The aid cuts alone mean that nearly 275,000 people won't get the AIDS treatment they need… resulting in over 63,000 deaths… a quarter million more children becoming AIDS orphans. Real people. Real bleeding.</p><p>That's why you'll hear us in the ONE Campaign making the case that the cuts shouldn't cost the lives. Cuts can cost the lives of the poorest of the poor… shouldn't be a hard case to make ,but it is right now—in the halls of Congress, in the Senate, maybe even in Healy Hall.</p><p>I put it to you, we must not let this economic recession become a moral recession. That would be a double cruelty. You know, it doesn't just take you're your chances at home, this recession, but it might take away your generation's shot at greatness in the wider world…</p><p>The generation before you outlawed the idea that the color of your skin decided whether you could vote. It challenged the idea that your sex could decide your future. Well, this generation has the chance to challenge the absurdity of where you live deciding whether you live.</p><p>The most vivid example of this for me was a clinic in Kigali, in Rwanda in 2003—long queues of too-skinny, far too skinny men and women. Long queues who were courageous enough to take an HIV test. The nurses knowing that a diagnosis was a death sentence—as there were no anti-retroviral drugs in that clinic, or any other clinic in Rwanda for that matter.</p><p>Looking into the eyes of hopelessness I was surprised to find no anger, no rage… just a strange acquiescence. Not so the nurses— The nurses who knew that this was not a killer disease in Europe or America. They had a very different look in their eyes.</p><p>Fast-forward five years. The same clinic… a whole different scenario. Nurses beaming with job satisfaction. These death camps had become birth camps… maternal clinics… what they were supposed to be in the first place. Not just a city but a whole country who understood that the United States had a deep respect for their lives.</p><p>And this was not the old paternalism. This was partnership. Because without it, Partnership that is, without that partnership Rwanda would not have managed to get life-saving AIDS drugs to 91 percent, it is, of the people who need them. Good leadership, as it happens. We have problems with the leadership there on other fronts, but on this, they got the AIDS drugs to the people. Provided by the United States.</p><p>It's a moving story… and we are moved by such moving events… I'm probably here because of such events. But I tell you this, in The ONE Campaign, ours is not such a soft vocal lens. We try to keep our ardour cold… welcome the evidence-based activist.</p><p>Can you believe that? The dryness of that term. I'm proud of the dryness of it. Evidence-based activist. Yours truly.</p><p>I'm here to tell you your heart is not the most important thing. It helps. But your heart isn't going to solve these problems. If your heart hasn't found a rhyme with your head, we're not going to get anywhere.</p><p>It is not charity that fires us, at the ONE campaign, or at RED, it is justice that inflames us.</p><p>And justice is a higher, tougher standard.</p><p>This is hard work. I'm not going to soft-pedal it.</p><p>We have meetings sometimes about marketing. And people in marketing look for clear, simple melody lines: \"Just a dollar and you can save a life. Just a minute of your time. Just an hour of your week.\" It's bollocks. It's not true—it's crap. In truth if you want to turn the world right side up, it's not going to take a minute, or an hour, or a day.</p><p>It's going to take your whole life. And I'm going to make a bid for that, this evening, to you.</p><p>So that was the brakes—now for the gas.</p><p>And for me, where it all started, it all starts where humanity started… and where our humanity is needed now…</p><p>It's Africa.</p><p>I mean, you should as a very good question. Why should you be listening to me talking about Africa? Desmond Tutu is much funnier. But he's much busier.</p><p>But you know this Africa has been an extraordinary adventure for me, a privilege. Africa: Wild, magnificent, magical, sometimes maddening Africa.</p><p>But extraordinary.</p><p>I realized the other day that I have been working for Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu for most of my life. I think since I was eighteen.</p><p>From anti-apartheid through Drop the Debt… from the fight against hunger to the fight for human rights—human rights-- the right to live like a human.</p><p>Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Tutu—there is no point in even trying to turn these two down.</p><p>Particularly Tutu, 'cause he calls in the big guns… On the rare occasion that I have tried to turn him down he has told me he will personally see to it that I won't get into Heaven…</p><p>And I think he might have that kind of pull!</p><p>But even if it weren't for them, I think I'd have felt the pull to Africa.</p><p>Because Ireland, maybe. I've got some Irish friends there… [points] Bret and Andrea… Irish Ambassador, there... Very cool. Ireland has a very living memory of famine… coming out from colonization…</p><p>Or maybe it's because Africa's the future… and Edge is from the future.</p><p>I mean, we are all interested in the future …what the world will look like for the kids, right?</p><p>People say China is the future, but if you ask the Chinese they're all headed to Africa. The largest diaspora in recent times is from China to Africa… By 2050, Africa's population is going to be twice the size of China's. Africa's going to be big and it's going to be young. 60 percent of Africans right now are under 25. Can you imagine that?</p><p>All across the continent, people are writing new rules for the game. African entrepreneurs, African civil society, a whole new generation of politicians… They're the catalysts of change… and you can see the impact in so many ways.</p><p>For example: 14 of the poorest countries… which didn't benefit from the last decade's commodity boom, but did get 100% debt cancellation and a threefold increase in aid… achieved the following: Extreme poverty—on track to be halved by 2015. Child mortality—nearly halved already. School enrollment: doubled. And economic growth: 5.5% on average for a decade.</p><p>You want data? I've got data….</p><p>We used to talk about the Asian Tigers… And actually for a minute we were talking about a Celtic one, which was nice, while it lasted…</p><p>But this is not an African tiger. This is a lion, this is a pride of lions, and lots of them are roaring… some that are not. Some of them are in a bad mood… injured, licking their wounds. And we all know a wounded lion is a dangerous thing…</p><p>Take Mali. Ethnomusicologists trace the origins of the blues and therefore rock n roll to Mali, and West Africa, and I was just there in January at their renowned music festival in the desert, Festival de la Desert, and dunes outside of Timbuktu. It's amazing, by the way. Really awesome.</p><p>A month after we left, Al Qaeda, known regionally as Ansar Dine, took over the whole north of Mali, North of Mali is about the size of France. And now the hotel we stayed in is the sharia tribunal. Music is now against the law – I mean, they put you into prison for playing music; you get beaten for playing the blues, you get beaten to death, on occasion, for playing the blues.</p><p>Mali is a case study for the whole of that vast belt of sand and savannah called the Sahel… which includes Sudan… and Somalia… And Nigeria, which is an enormous country… and in this geography we get to see up close what we call the three extremes. It's an unholy trio of: extreme poverty, extreme climate, and extreme ideology.</p><p>A very dangerous unholy trio—stronger than any chain and harder to break...</p><p>So, some of Africa rising, some of Africa stuck.</p><p>The question is whether the rising bit will pull the rest of Africa up… or whether the other Africa will weigh the continent down.</p><p>Which will it be?</p><p>The stakes here aren't just about them — imagine for a second this last global recession but without the economic growth of China and India… without the hundreds of millions of newly minted middle class folks who buy American and European goods… Imagine that. Think about the last five years.</p><p>Rock star preaches capitalism. Shocker. Wow. Sometimes I hear myself and I just can't believe it…</p><p>But commerce is real. That's what you're about here. It's real. Aid is just a stub cap. Commerce, entrepreneurial capitalism takes more people out of poverty than aid, of course, we know that.</p><p>We need Africa to become an economic powerhouse….it's not just in their interest… it's in OURS…. It's in our national interest, in our national security interest too, your national security interests in particular. We want to see the region fulfill its potential.</p><p>So cue up the drum roll, you can if you like.</p><p>Enter our protagonist.</p><p>Enter the most powerful force for change on the continent…</p><p>Enter the strongest, loudest, clearest voice for progress…</p><p>Enter… the nerd.</p><p>Yes, I did say \"the nerd.\"</p><p>Because it's the nerds, the innovators, the programmers who are changing the game not only here, in America, but even more in places like Africa which are more mobile than we are. Africa is the second-largest mobile market after Asia.</p><p>Yes, this is the era of the Afro-nerd…</p><p>What are these Afro-nerds up to? You know what they're up to? They're upending the pyramid.</p><p>You know about social media and the role it played in the Arab Spring. I recently met an amazing guy called Wael Ghonim—I'm sure you know him. He worked in Google and he set up one of the Facebook groups behind Tahrir Square thing, and got thrown in jail for it. And I was at the Founders conference in Dublin, and he was explaining the role of technology and how it has narrowed the gap between the power of politicians and the power of individuals.</p><p>You see, according to Wael, technology has turbo-charged social movements. And this is this element I'm telling you about that defines your generation. And it works on lots of surfaces.</p><p>For example, it is definitely true that the biggest killer of them all—bigger than malaria, bigger than AIDS, bigger than TB— probably bigger than all three combined — the disease that kills the most people in the world and the world's poor—is corruption.</p><p>But we have the vaccine.</p><p>We have the vaccine, it's called transparency.</p><p>It's called daylight. Sunlight. Information.</p><p>Technology is increasing transparency, you see.</p><p>Now, there might be some downsides to this. Like the fact that I'm on my holidays with my kids and my wife and a picture of my sunburned arse turns up on the cover of a tabloid… That is true… I think \"BOTTOMS UP\" was the headline…Should have been \"rock bottom,\" that's what I would have chosen.</p><p>But the upside is that if someone's up to no good in business or government, it's getting harder and harder for them to hide it.</p><p>And this is true north as well as south of the equator…</p><p>Isn't it extraordinary that the two parties who are most important in the transaction that we call development assistance—ie., aid— the two most important parties—the taxpayers who give the money and the people who benefit from the money – are the two people who know the least about it. Are the two parties who know the least about it.</p><p>That's mad. And I know Raj thinks that. And it's gonna change.</p><p>The biggest argument we always hear against development assistance— aid-- which remember, is a tiny fraction of the federal budget… less than one percent—is that it's [in]efficient, that bureaucracy gets in the way, and kleptocrats run off with it.</p><p>But now everyone can see what's happening. The trajectory of information technology is strangely enough, more information.</p><p>African citizens are holding governments and companies to account. In Uganda, they're monitoring elections with mobile phones and camerias. In Kenya, they're using websites like ipaidabribe.ke to expose officials who are on the take. East Africa there's an initiative—citizen-started—called Twaweza, which means \"yes, we can\" in Swahili… Who knew! Anyways, they're opening the books on government spending, they wanna see.</p><p>Transparency is driving down pharmaceutical prices. It's even starting to transform the extractive industries—some people here know what I'm talking about — oil and mining.</p><p>This is big, because there's a lot of wealth in natural resources, down under the ground in these developing countries, and this open data can help get that wealth above ground, to benefit the people who live over it.</p><p>Anyway all this I'm describing is only a start. I'm not even mentioning banking by phone… or pricing information for farmers…</p><p>But here's the catch. It's an obvious one.</p><p>Technology doesn't accomplish this on its own. You can't just drop a cell phone in the desert and create an oasis. There's no app for that. Yet.</p><p>The crucial element is still the human element.</p><p>It's individual citizens, numbering in the millions and determined to stir things up.</p><p>It's the human element that got us to a moment where an extra 50 million African children are going to school today, because people in America and other countries got out and marched for debt cancellation… same goes for the 6.2 million Africans now getting life-saving AIDS drugs, because people in the US were willing to stand up and shout and pay for that…</p><p>Those and other victories took not phones in the hand but boots on the ground… the boots of everyday activists in every town and city and on college campuses like Georgetown. That's really what moves the dial. Social movements. Social enterprise. Because when people get busy, get organized, get out there, real change happens. Global change.</p><p>It's a simple equation: outside pressure, inside movement.</p><p>That's the idea of ONE, we're a social enterprise, like (RED). (RED) is like the gateway drug to ONE. If you haven't got time to put on the marching boots, go buy some (RED) shit. Deborah Dugan is here somewhere, she rocks, runs the show. But the idea that there is a movement out there when myself or Bill Gates is going in to lobby a president or prime minister, to try to get them to keep their commitments to the poorest of the poor, that politician is also hearing from thousands—hundreds of thousands—of people who agree with us.</p><p>And it's harder to ignore them… than it is to ignore me.</p><p>As persuasive as I like to think I am.</p><p>Ask the congressman who thought it would look good on him, picking a fight with ONE… He tried to block an important bill and said on the radio he didn't think his constituents thought it important. He is bombarded by e-mails and petitions. And then, really dirty trick, they were waiting for him when he came out his church on Sunday. He threw his hands in the air and said, \"I had no idea you people felt so strongly. I'm so sorry, I now support the bill.\" That's what we do.</p><p>And then of course there's the politicians that you don't have to lobby. I want make a major shout for Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senators Pat Leahy and Norm Coleman, all of whom, not just great leadership, real deep personal commitment. We shouldn't just thank them, we should shout their names across the land…</p><p>I actually, I cannot even consider the number of lives that have been transformed—indeed saved by these people. It must be millions. People are alive because these people exist.</p><p>Gene Sperling is here tonight… Raj Shah's here tonight. These are heroes to me. It's a civic duty, with the global citizen in mind.</p><p>And actually, you know, if George Bush were here, and I know his daughter Barbara is, I would get Matt Damon to kiss him on the lips!</p><p>And, I would give him a more Irish, macho kind of handshake thing… and you know it's incredible, you know George Bush, President Bush's name is in the history books. His name is in the front forward of a book that's written on the end of AIDS, the greatest health crisis in 600 years. Both sides working.</p><p>And if Bill Clinton was here, at his alma mater… why, I'd just get him to make the speech, actually. Because you know the Secretary of Explaining Stuff is more a rock star than I'll ever be.</p><p>\"I just want to thank Bono here for stepping away from the microphone… I knew he couldn't rhyme but I'm so glad he can fall back on adding and subtracting… As you know, I mean, the ONE Campaign might be the one thing all of us can agree on!\"</p><p>Dude.</p><p>And all of this happens without social media.</p><p>Can you imagine what you can accomplish… turbo-charged.</p><p>The power of these tools, the power of technology, is the leverage they give us…</p><p>If we're willing to use it.</p><p>And I think we are. I know we are, I know you are.</p><p>Whether you join ONE, or buy (RED), or join an NGOs that we work alongside. We need you engaged in the fight… It's the defining struggle of our age. And it's not just aid, which is getting smarter and smarter; it's trade, it's investment, it's social enterprise. It's working with the citizenry to help unlock their own domestic resources… so they can do it for themselves.</p><p>Think anyone in Africa likes aid? Come on. Think anyone in Ireland likes aid? Germany rebuilds after the Second World War. They'll take it though.</p><p>Anyways, it's not a right-left issue, it's a right-wrong issue.</p><p>And America's consistently been on the side of what's right.</p><p>Because when it comes down to it, this is about keeping faith with the idea of America.</p><p>Because America is an idea, isn't it? I mean, Ireland's a great country, but it's not an idea. Great Britain's a great country, but it's not an idea.</p><p>That's how we see you around the world… as one of the greatest ideas in human history. Right up there with the Renaissance... right up there with crop rotation… The Beatles' White Album...</p><p>That idea, the America idea, it's an idea. The idea is that you and me are created equal…</p><p>It will ensure that an economic recession need not become an equality recession.</p><p>The idea that life is not meant to be endured, but enjoyed.</p><p>The idea that if we have dignity… if we have justice… then leave it to us, we can do the rest.</p><p>This country was the first to claw its way out of darkness and put that on paper. And God love you for it. Because these aren't just American ideas anymore. There's no copyright on them. You've brought them into the world. It's a wide world now.</p><p>I know Americans say they have a bit of the world in them. And you do. The family tree has a lot of branches. But the thing is… the world has a bit of America in it, too. These truths… your truths… they are self-evident in us.</p><p>So those people I've been talking about today… the poor… they're not those people.</p><p>They're not \"them.\" They're \"us.\" They're you.</p><p>They may be separated from us by oceans and circumstance. But they dream as you dream. They value what you value. There is no them, only us…</p><p>That American anthem is not exceptionalism… it's universalism. There is no them, only us.</p><p>Ubuntu: I am because we are… There is no them, only us.</p><p>The Jesuits know something about this… this largeness of spirit. This expanded sense, enlightened sense, of who's your neighbor.</p><p>I'm not a Jesuit. My mother was a Protestant and my father, a Catholic—he was not of the Jesuit order. He was of a whole other order. But here's what I know. I love him and miss him.</p><p>But, here's what I know about the Jesuits and about Ignatius Loyola. He was a soldier and he was lying on a bed recovering from his wounds when he had what they call \"a conversion of the heart.\"</p><p>He saw God's work—and the call to do God's work—not just in the church, in everything and everywhere. The arts, universities. The Orient and the New World.</p><p>And once he knew about that, he couldn't unknow it.</p><p>It changed him. It forced him out of bed and into the world.</p><p>And that's what I'm hoping happens here, at Georgetown with you.</p><p>Because when you truly accept that those children in some far-off place in the global village have the same value as you in God's eyes—or even just in your eyes—then your life is forever changed.</p><p>You see something that you can't unsee.</p><p>We have a sense of it from the words of Wael Ghonim. I have his words tattooed on my brain, that man who stood in Tahrir Square at the start of the 21st century: \"We are going to win because we don't understand politics. We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games. We're going to win because we don't have a party political agenda. We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts. We're going to win because we have dreams. We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams.\"</p><p>We're gonna win… because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power.</p><p>Thank you.\"</p><p><em>Bono was talking at Georgetown University on Monday 12 November 2012</em></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

The beans weren't junk – not the kind, as the broker put it, that end up at a truck stop in Poland – but they were a few steps down from the standard buys.</p><p>It was a shrewd move. Coffee was trading at an <a href=\"http://www.ico.org/prices/p2.htm\" title=\"\">all-time high</a>, and the multinational brands knew that consumers were more likely to flip out at a modest price hike than a drop in quality. Switch good beans for passable beans and few will notice, let alone care; keep your standards but raise prices 10c and you'll have customers complaining in the queue and tweeting about it from the counter.</p><p>I bring up this observation in response to a <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0047981\" title=\"\">study </a>published by researchers at Kew's Royal Botanic Gardens and Ethiopia's Environment and Coffee Forest Forum, which arrives at the disheartening conclusion that some – and possibly all – of the wild arabica coffee growing in Ethiopia, which is considered to be the birthplace of coffee, will be extinct by 2080, a victim of the effects of climate change. (According to the study, the far smaller number of wild coffees found in parts of neighbouring <a href=\"http://worldcoffeeresearch.org/2012/05/25/specialty-coffee-chronicle-emma-bladyka-on-south-sudan-wcr-expedition/\" title=\"\">South Sudan</a> and Kenya will follow suit.) But I'm not sure many people will notice.</p><p>To be clear, the study doesn't spell out the end of coffee. While it predicts the eradication of wild arabica, the study says little about cultivated arabica, which accounts for nearly all the arabica grown on the planet. (To the journalists who <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/11/08/climate-change-is-making-your-coffee-more-expensive/\" title=\"\">missed</a> or <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/agriculture/9661559/Coffee-threatened-by-climate-change.html\" title=\"\">mishandled</a> this <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/11/09/coffee-arabica-extinct.html\" title=\"\">basic </a>distinction, it's a good idea to skim a peer-reviewed paper before writing about it.)</p><p>It's safe to say that arabica will continue to be planted, harvested, traded, and turned into lattes well past 2080. Agronomists are good at engineering solutions, and if the quality of cultivated coffee suffers as a result, the traders in Antwerp are banking that most of you won't care as long as the price on the menu board holds steady.</p><p>What the study details is the likely disappearance of Ethiopia's wild coffees. Chances are, you have never tasted wild coffee. Only an estimated 5% of Ethiopia's production is wild, what is known locally as \"forest coffee\" (Cultivated plantings in Ethiopia are called \"garden coffee\"). Willem Boot of Boot Coffee, an expert on Ethiopia, thinks it could be even less, around 1% or 2%.</p><p>But that tiny amount accounts for the most diverse sampling of coffee in the world. By one estimate, Ethiopia is home to 98.8% of arabica coffee's gene pool. Most of that diversity is found in the forest.</p><p>How many wild coffees are there? It's hard to say – the scholarship doesn't exist. The number some kick around is 1,000, while others think it's higher. These coffees are the stuff of myth. They fire up the imaginations of many leading traders and roasters in the industry's creative class because there's a decent chance that they include some of the world's most spectacular and distinctive coffees. The reasoning goes: if the farmed coffee of Ethiopia is (at its best) that good, just imagine what has yet to be discovered, and what it might taste like if it was processed carefully.</p><p>It's not entirely hypothetical. It happened in Panama. In 2002, Daniel Peterson of <a href=\"http://haciendaesmeralda.com/\" title=\"\">Hacienda la Esmeralda</a> noted the exceptional quality of the coffee grown on a property his family owned in Jaramillo, outside of the town of Boquete. It turns out the plants were geisha, an Ethiopian variety gathered by a British diplomat in the 1930s and cultivated in Panama in the 1960s.</p><p>When the coffee was first sold at auction in 2004, it shattered the record price for coffee (which it set again in 2006, 2007 and 2010). It wasn't because of gimmicks or marketing – nobody knew what geisha was at first – but because of its unusual flavour profile: floral, \"bright\", \"pretty\". It redefined what coffee could taste like.</p><p>How many strange, delicious coffees are growing wild in Ethiopia? We will never know.  Just when we're ready to appreciate the unfamiliar – this generation of tastemakers is fascinated by the peculiar, the mind-blowing – it looks like coffee's most diverse catalogue of flavours will steadily diminish, and probably disappear. The loss of tonnage will be made up elsewhere, but the loss of possibility will be absolute.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/13/1352806270372/Ethiopian-coffee-farmer-w-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/13/coffee-not-dead-wild-ethiopia","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/13/coffee-not-dead-wild-ethiopia","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"The great mobile technology leap forward","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-11T00:00:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2012/nov/11/mobile-technology-leap-forward","fields":{"body":"<h2>Education</h2><p>For years teachers have been battling against the use of mobile phones in class. But that is changing as schools start to embrace the sophisticated technology many of their pupils carry in their pockets.</p><p>At its most simple, teachers allow students to use the internet for research. But imaginative lessons take it a step further. One teacher describes a history lesson that required students to do mock archaeology around the classroom to find hidden quick-response barcodes. Once found, the students scanned them with their smartphones and video clips about the subject appeared on their screens. And it is not just secondary schools. Increasingly, primary schools are using iPads and other tablet computers, which are quick to set up and young children take to because they are so intuitive.</p><p>But the uptake has been painfully slow. Valerie Thompson is head of the e-learning foundation that helps schools to provide children with computers. \"Schools are the last institutions in the UK to come to the technology table,\" she says. \"What technology allows teachers to do is give children an individual learning experience; not give all children the same lesson at the same speed in the same place.\"</p><p>Teachers, she says, will have an entirely different job in this new world. \"You don't need a teacher who knows everything when you can go onto the internet. The revolution is not the technology, it is the changing role of the teacher to make the most of the technology.\"</p><p>There are already some 200,000 educational apps. One of publisher Pearson's products allows the student to do their homework on their mobile device and participate in class, the teacher to analyse the student's performance, and the parents to see what they are doing.</p><p>These types of companies have been pushing mobile education for years, but it is only with the rise of tablet computers that schools have caught on.  Apple chief executive Tim Cook recently said: \"The adoption rate of iPad in education is something I'd never seen from any technology product . Usually, education tends to be a fairly conservative institution in terms of buying and we're not seeing that at all on the iPad.\" Last week, the Scottish government announced plans to spend around £30m on tablets for use in schools, colleges and universities.</p><p>Juan Lopez-Valcarcel, chief digital officer at Pearson International, says: \"We're reaching the tipping point in terms of adoption and interest of mobile technology in the classroom. Soon we won't be talking about mobile education as a separate thing; all education will be on mobile devices.\"<strong>JM</strong></p><h2>Books</h2><p>The internet began changing the music and newspaper industries over a decade ago, but its impact on book publishing was not felt until the arrival of the tablet computer.</p><p>The digital revolution has been painful for record labels and press barons, as the number of people willing to pay for what they produce dwindles by the day. Book publishers, by contrast, have enjoyed a smoother transition, largely thanks to Amazon.</p><p>The online retailer's success may have sounded the death knell for \"physical\" bookstores, and squeezed publishers' margins, but its popularisation of the e-reader has created a new market where digital books can be sold, rather than pirated.</p><p>The Kindle appeared in the UK in 2009, the first iPad in April 2010. Thanks to these two devices, instant gratification is now possible for the book buyer and the result has been more reading. Studies say that e-reader owners buy more books, and this summer Amazon announced that digital formats had outsold paper for the first time in the UK.</p><p>Publishers are racing to adapt. HarperCollins employs a data analyst, recruited from American Express, to monitor online sales around the clock and tweak prices accordingly. Its venerable Collins World Atlas is now an app, displaying its data on clickable globes. Nosy Crow, the children's publisher founded two years ago by former Macmillan MD Kate Wilson, is doing a brisk trade in apps commissioned from the likes of Gruffalo illustrator Axel Scheffler, creating original content, rather than \"existing books squashed onto phones\".</p><p>Amazon's success is not without problems for publishers. While it has modernised their business, its market power, particularly in the UK, is almost completely unchallenged. The concern is that it will force damaging price reductions on publishers, in order to pull in customers with heavily discounted bestsellers.</p><p>Publishing houses responded by forming an alliance with Apple, which allowed them to set the prices and the iPad maker to take a 30% cut on every title sold. Bestsellers could then be withheld from Amazon if it did not play ball on pricing.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos fought hard to have the agency model outlawed, and he has now won his battle both in the US and Europe, where most of the big publishers have offered to settle. Penguin was not among them, but a merger is being arranged with Random House, to create the world's largest publisher – and a stronger base from which to counter the might of Amazon. <strong>JG</strong></p><h2>Health</h2><p>In Africa, mobile phones are not only changing lives, but saving them. The prevalence of mobiles in Africa – there are more mobiles than toilets and 10&nbsp;times as many mobiles as landlines – has put them at the frontline of the battle against HIV/Aids, malaria and deaths during childbirth.</p><p>As the price of basic handsets drops below $10, the United Nations is using them to bring healthcare to distant villages, rather than spending millions building clinics. \"You get a lot more healthcare for your money [from mobiles],\" Kathy Calvin, chief executive of the UN Foundation, has said. \"For decades delivering healthcare in rural settings has been inefficient and slow. If you run out of drugs or condoms, or there is an outbreak of disease, the only way to communicate the problem is to write it down on a bit of paper. It was crying out for a modern solution.\"</p><p>Calvin believes mobiles have the potential to have as big an impact on global heath as Sir Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin in 1928.</p><p>In Tanzania, texts are being used to help eradicate obstetric fistula, a debilitating condition that causes millions of stillbirths across Africa and can make social outcasts of the mothers who suffer from it. The condition can be corrected with a simple £250 operation but many sufferers either don't know they can be cured or cannot afford to travel to the hospital.</p><p>\"We have a nice big hospital, full of good doctors, but no patients,\" said Tom Vanneste, deputy director of a local NGO, Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation in Tanzania, which provides treatment for obstetric fistula, thanks to millions of pounds of funding from the EU and Tanzanian government.</p><p>The problem has been noticed by Vodacom, the country's biggest mobile phone network, which has appointed a team of 60 \"ambassadors\", to travel around the country diagnosing women with the condition. Within an hour of an ambassador finding a patient, a date is set for surgery and money for transport is texted to the ambassador, who takes the patient to the bus stop.</p><p>Mobiles are changing healthcare in the UK, too. O2 has launched a special service to allow relatives of elderly or vulnerable people to keep tabs on their loved ones. The monitoring service, called Help at Hand and dubbed \"tag-a-granny\", is designed to alert carers or doctors automatically if a relative suffers a fall or wanders away from home without warning.</p><p>Analysts at Juniper Research estimate global revenues from remote patient monitoring will rise to almost $1.9bn by 2014. <strong>RN</strong></p><h2>Farming</h2><p>Farmers in Africa don't have state-of-the-art tractors with computer-guided ploughing patterns, satnavs and in-cab entertainment systems like their western rivals. But they do have access to the latest weather reports, planting advice, disease diagnostics and market prices thanks to even the most basic mobile phones.</p><p>In Tanzania, local mobile operator Vodacom last month began a new scheme which allows farmers to negotiate prices for their crops with market traders without having to take their goods all the way to the market.</p><p>The service is run using Vodacom's M-Pesa mobile money service, which has helped to transform financial transactions on the continent. In a land where the vast majority of people do not have a bank account, money can be transferred quickly and cheaply, directly between mobile phones. In Kenya, the amount of money transferred by mobile phone each year equates to 11% of GDP.</p><p>In Uganda, 500 community knowledge workers have been provided with smartphones to download and disseminate the latest weather and agricultural information to almost a million farmers. Most of the information, provided by government departments such the agriculture and meteorology departments, is displayed in text form, but Grameen Foundation, which runs the project, is beginning to send images and videos to help those with limited reading skills.</p><p>Even the most basic of phones can be turned into a vital tool for remote farmers, including a service that can help predict when cows are likely to give birth. iCow collects and stores milking and breeding records, sends farmers best-practice advice and the location of the nearest vets. The service calls itself \"the world's first mobile phone cow calendar\".</p><p>A report by Vodafone – which owns a majority stake in Vodacom – Accenture and Oxfam predicts that enhanced mobile technologies could help increase agricultural income in 26 countries by $138bn by 2020. It also predicts that using mobiles to remotely control water pumps could help towards a 6% saving in fresh water supply. The report envisages the creation of a \"farmer helpline\" that would provide critical information to agricultural workers and help them to deal with problems, such as pests and the use of chemicals, that they face on the fields.</p><p>\"Mobile telephony could have significant potential to help the poorest farmers towards greater food and income security,\" says Barbara Stocking, chief executive of Oxfam. \"In Cambodia, the Philippines and Indonesia, we are testing market information accessibility through SMS servicing and in Bangladesh we are working to provide storm warnings to fishing communities via mobiles.\" <strong>RN</strong></p><h2>Technology</h2><p>The third coming of the web is upon us, and it is mobile. The advent of the smartphone is changing not just pre-digital companies but also those that rose to prominence via the internet.</p><p>Web 2.0 firms such as Google and Facebook are having to adapt to the small screen. Failing to make the transition to 3.0 could cost them their futures. Fears that Facebook would not be able to keep up with its young customers – 600 million of its 1 billion users are mobile – were a big reason its share price halved after its flotation. The picture has improved this autumn. Founder Mark Zuckerberg told investors that in its most recent quarter, 14% of Facebook's ad revenues – some $150m (£94m) – were from mobile.</p><p>These are not print ads scaled down. Facebook is succeeding because it is reinventing the format. Among its new ideas are injecting promotions for apps into a customer's news feed, describing the product and linking to the relevant page of the app store.</p><p>Mobile advertising is still in the research lab, finding new ways of using location information, maps, calendar alerts and \"click to call\" buttons. Restaurant reviews, hotel bookings and store sales are all fruitful themes for advertising to those on the move.</p><p>Google has become particularly adept at this, and says that it expects to earn $8bn from mobile this year, up from $2.5bn a year ago. The number includes sales from its app store, but the \"vast majority\" is advertising, according to Google's finance chief.</p><p>So why did the search giant's share price slump 20% before being suspended on the day of its last financial results? Investors were not just unnerved by a clerical error which pushed the earnings release out early; they took fright at a rapid decline in the all-important \"cost per click\" of Google's ads.</p><p>The price paid decreased 15% from the same period last year, even as the number of paid clicks on ads climbed 33%. Mobile advertising is worth less than desktop advertising, which in turn is worth much less than television and print advertising. Making money from mobile devices is no mean feat, even for digital natives. <strong>JG</strong></p><h2>Retailers</h2><p>It's no longer enough for clothing retailers to fill their stores with the latest fashions, as the popularity of smartphones feeds a new mobile shopping culture. At the relaunch of New Look's store in London's West End on Friday, model Kelly Brook, who designs a range for the retailer, was clutching an iPad to demonstrate the use of Blippar – an app that links smartphone users to extra video and product content on the retailer's website – throughout the store.</p><p>Tech-savvy shoppers are embracing these \"augmented reality\" apps, which turn phones into barcode scanners that glean extra information and gather online prices. Phone companies on the lookout for trends in the millions of texts, calls and internet searches every hour have also identified hotspots around changing rooms as shoppers photograph themselves trying on new outfits, then beam the images to friends for an instant verdict on Facebook.</p><p>The growing might of internet – and now mobile – shopping has spawned retail industry buzzwords such as \"multichannel\" and even \"omnichannel\", which attempt to describe how customers increasingly use stores and websites in tandem. Retailers find that the more channels their customers use, the more they spend. M&amp;S says people who shop on its website as well in its stores spend four times as much; throw smartphones into the mix and they spend eight times as much.</p><p>Jon Copestake, chief retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that by 2022 mobile commerce will be mainstream as consumers make impulse purchases directly on their smartphones. Within a decade, at least a third of UK retail sales will be rung up on phones, computers and social media websites, he says, compared with around 10% today. Copestake also predicts that bargain-hunting websites such as Groupon and mysupermarket will have merged and expanded into sophisticated sites tailoring and personalising the best offers for consumers.</p><p>With the internet increasingly part of modern life, chains such as Tesco and M&amp;S are starting to offer free instore Wi-Fi as a matter of course. Tesco boss Philip Clarke argues the tough economic climate has made digital technology even more important: \"People are shopping online to take control of their budgets, seek the best bargains, find out what offers best value,\" he told a recent conference. \"By Christmas, we reckon one in five online purchases will be via smartphones.\" <strong>ZW</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/About/General/2012/11/9/1352488515164/A-young-woman-reads-a-Kin-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/11/mobile-technology-leap-forward","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2012/nov/11/mobile-technology-leap-forward","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Lethal weapons may have given early humans edge over Neanderthals","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-07T18:08:00Z","sectionId":"science","id":"science/2012/nov/07/lethal-weapons-early-humans-neanderthals","fields":{"body":"<p>Early humans wandered out of Africa armed with darts and arrows that made them formidable hunters and deadly competitors for any Neanderthals that stood in their way.</p><p>The revised version of the human story follows the discovery in South Africa of a haul of small stone blades or \"bladelets\" that formed lethal weapon tips, either for arrows fired from bows, or spears propelled from <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=atlatls&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=1bU&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bo6aUMjLHMeyhAeV8IGIDg&amp;ved=0CCsQsAQ&amp;biw=1899&amp;bih=1020\" title=\"\">wooden throwers</a> called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlatl\" title=\"\">atlatls</a>.</p><p>Researchers uncovered more than 70 sharp stone tips measuring no more than 5cm long while excavating an eroded cliff face that overlooks the ocean at a site called Pinnacle Point on the south coast.</p><p>The development of the technology allowed early humans to attack wild animals or human foes from a greater distance and with more devastating effect. \"People who possess light armaments that can be thrown long distances have immediate advantages in hunting prey and killing competitors,\" <a href=\"http://iho.asu.edu/people_faculty/Marean\" title=\"ASU: Curtis Marean\">Curtis Marean</a>, project director at Arizona State University, told the Guardian.</p><p>The blades were made from a rock called <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/544043/silcrete\" title=\"\">silcrete</a> that must be heated in fire to transform it into a material that can be flaked into a sharp edge. Long, thin flakes of stone were notched and snapped to make smaller tips, and then blunted on one side so they could be fixed into lengths of wood or bone to make a spear or dart.</p><p>Tests on the stone tools found at Pinnacle Point revealed they were made throughout a period lasting from 71,000 to 60,000 years ago, suggesting that one of the earliest arms industries was sustained by knowledge and expertise handed down from generation to generation. Details of the haul <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11660\" title=\"An early and enduring advanced technology originating 71,000 years ago in South Africa\">are reported in the journal Nature</a>.</p><p>To manufacture the projectile tips, early humans must have collected raw rock materials, gathered wood for burning, known how to heat-treat the silcrete, prepare and trim the blades, and finally attach them to arrows and spears. The ability to master these tasks and pass them down to others draws on brain functions that are essential to the modern mind.</p><p>Scientists have unearthed similar stone bladelets at other sites in South Africa and Kenya, but none so old or as enduring as those discovered at Pinnacle Point. The technology spread to other parts of Africa and Eurasia around 20,000 years later.</p><p>Kyle Brown, a co-author on the paper from the University of Cape Town said the team spotted the minute but carefully made tools among the smallest material collected in sieves used at the excavation site.</p><p>Marean believes the combination of more advanced weapons and greater cooperative behaviour among the early humans was a \"knockout punch\" for the Neanderthals. \"Combine them, as modern humans did, and still do, and no prey or competitor is safe,\" he said. \"This probably laid the foundation for the expansion out of Africa of modern humans and the extinction of many prey as well as our sister species such as the Neanderthals.\"</p><p>In <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11751\" title=\"Sharpening the mind\">an accompanying article</a>, <a href=\"http://www.anth.uconn.edu/faculty/mcbrearty/\" title=\"UConn: Sally McBrearty\">Sally McBrearty</a>, an anthropologist at the University of Connecticut, notes that the preparation of the stone weapon tips must have taken \"days, weeks or months\" and been interrupted from time to time by more urgent tasks. This suggests the early human weapons-makers had the brain power to hold tasks and future plans in their memories.</p><p>The invention of stone bladelets in south Africa may have defined the success of humans as they moved north to occupy the rest of the world. In the journal, Prof McBrearty writes: \"Human populations are thought to have started migrating from Africa shortly after 100,000 years ago.

Russian companies primarily sell air transport services and food supplies. </p><p>• In 2011, procurement from developing and emerging countries increased by $126m, bringing their share of UN business to 58.7%. </p><p>• The US is still the top supplier of goods and services to the sprawling UN system, providing 10% of the total last year.</p><p>• Some UN agencies buy more from developing countries than others. The UN development programme (UNDP), for example, buys 79% of its goods and services from developing and emerging economies, while the UN children's fund (Unicef) buys less than 40% from them.</p><p>• The UK sold £417m in goods and services to the UN last year, down from £490m in 2010 but up by 40% from $295m in 2007.</p></blockquote><p>Unops says it is \"committed to ensuring fair and equitable access to the UN market\" and has tried to support developing country firms through outreach and capacity-building programmes, simplifying its vendor registration procedures, improving access to tender opportunities through an online portal, and restructuring bidding to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to participate. </p><p>In addition, it says, the industrial sectors of many developing and emerging economies have become more competitive since 2005, which can help explain their growth in the UN market.</p><p>The UN has been tainted by high-profile procurement controversies in the past – from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/aug/11/iraq.oil\">Oil-for-food scandal</a> to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/23/AR2006012301699.html\">suspicions of collusion and price inflation in procurement for peacekeeping operations</a>. </p><p>Previously, data on UN procurement was included in annual reports, published as pdfs, making it difficult to extract, explore and analyse. </p><p>Vitaly Vanshelboim, Unops deputy executive director, said the data release was part of the organisation's broader commitment to transparency. \"The more all stakeholders can see and understand how development funds are used, the greater the chance is that these limited resources will be used effectively,\" he said.</p><p>Unops has <a href=\"https://data.unops.org/index.htm#SegmentCode=ORG&amp;FocusCode=DATA_CONTRACTS&amp;EntityCode=ORG_CODE&amp;EntityValue=UNOPS##SectionCode=OVERVIEW\">published further details of its own contracts</a> – including supplier names and the purpose of awarded contracts – on a dynamic feed updated every 24 hours, and geo-coded information on the over 1,000 projects it supports around the world. </p><p>The full data is below.

Who will robocall what lie, what machine will break, <strong>who will <em>steal the election</em></strong> in any of the few remaining battleground states? One YouTube of a voting machine not registering someone&apos;s Obama vote, and everyone&apos;s on edge all day.</p> <p>In Fairfax, Virginia, the largest county in the state that sits along the red-blue line dividing &quot;Old Virginia&quot; – Southern, white – from &quot;New Virginia&quot; – young people, professionals, yuppies, minorities, and other non-Real Americans – the elementary schools that serve as polling stations are enveloped in surveillance. What if there&apos;s some kind of organized racket or voting machine issue that screws up the tally in one of the most important counties in the country? It would only be surprising if someone didn&apos;t give it a shot.</p> <p>So that&apos;s why outside of Mosby Woods School in the residential town of Vienna, Virginia, the end of the DC Metro&apos;s Orange subway line, we weren&apos;t the only ones waiting to badger voters as they tried to perform their civic duty in peace and quiet.</p> <p>Three Republican party volunteers greeted all incoming voters with sample-ballots. Voters were then handed off to an Asian-American voters&apos; activist, who ensured that members of this large international community in Fairfax had everything in order and understood where they needed to go.</p> <p>Two poll watchers, at the door, and more along the way, through the long line that was about to get much longer as the workday ended.</p> <p>And then, when they exited, two other Asian-American voters&apos; activists offering surveys in at least Chinese and Korean – one voter requested Tibetan – followed by a voting machine monitor to keep track of malfunctions, and lastly, a Guardian reporter asking them personal questions about their politics, for publication.</p> <p>We chose to visit Mosby Woods after reading an early-day blurb about a voting machine failure there. Was this a scandalous failure, designed to suppress the Asian-American vote which went 62% nationally for President Obama in 2008? Was someone <em>stealing the election at this very elementary school?</em></p> <p>Nope. The voting machine monitor explained that the thing just had a glitch, or stalled for a minute. It slowed down the process, briefly, but the flow of voters resumed shortly afterwards. Not a big deal, at all.</p> <p>Now where&apos;s the fun in that, when every glitch reported across the country doesn&apos;t turn out to be a breathtaking scandal?</p> <p><em>Jim Newell</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50999062b579f74bac764bba\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T23:15:03.662Z\">6.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What happened to the supposed falloff in <strong>voter enthusiasm</strong> from 2008?

She is a woman (obviously), she voted for Obama in 2008 and she’s a registered independent in a vital swing state. So who did she vote for and why?</p> <p>“Romney. The economy,” she said with no hesitation when asked after she emerged from the voting booth in the small central Iowa town of Pella.</p> <p>She feels let down by the promises of four years ago and – more importantly – says she did not get the impression Obama had much of a plan for the next four years. She worries that her kids won’t have a future as good as her past. “It is the children thing mainly,” said the 40-year-old.</p> <p>“I have a daughter about to go to college and I want her to have a job when she comes out.” She said she drifted towards Romney over the summer and then the first debate settled her mind. &quot;That about did it. I started leaning Romney,&quot; she said.</p> <p>There are some Obama fans here, like John Phillybrook, 41 years old and a local software engineer. “I voted for Barack Obama,” he said after coming out of a branch of the American Legion which was serving as a polling place. “I just do not believe anything Mitt Romney says. He says he is going to create all these jobs but those are just promises to get elected. The Republicans always say things like that,” he explained before going off to finish his lunch break and heading back to work.</p> <p>But beneath Pella’s quaint small town exterior there do lurk some ugly political leanings. Shirley Schutte, 75 and retired, has a simple reason why she voted for Romney over Obama. “Obama is a Muslim,” she said bluntly. When asked if she was sure about that, she did not budge. “I am. I am not sure he even should have been there (in the White House).

Next I deselected her and started at the top of Romney&apos;s name and started tapping very closely together to find the &apos;active areas&apos;. From the top of Romney&apos;s button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside Obama&apos;s name was all active for Romney. From the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the Obama button (basically a small white sliver) is what let me choose Obama. Stein&apos;s button was fine. All other buttons worked fine.</p> <p>I asked the voters on either side of me if they had any problems and they reported they did not. I then called over a volunteer to have a look at it. She him hawed for a bit then calmly said &quot;It&apos;s nothing to worry about, everything will be OK.&quot; and went back to what she was doing. I then recorded this video.</p> <p>There is a lot of speculation that the footage is edited.

For every inch above normal rainfall, overall turnout drops by a little less than 1%, but Democratic turnout drops by 2.5%. Every inch above average snowfall decreases turnout by 0.5%. Since the water equivalent of 10 inches of snow usually equals an inch of rain, it&apos;s more likely snow will effect an election. [...]</p> <p>Florida is the one state where rain could change have more an impact. There will be showers in the northern half of the state including the key I-4 corridor. Even so, the race would have to be about a point to a point and a half tighter than polling average for the weather to have an effect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Harry takes a more in-depth look at the forecasts for different parts of 10 swing states <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/06/election-day-weather-forecast-florida\">here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509927dab579f74bac764b8d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-06T23:15:03.662Z\">6.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>The Guardian&apos;s Ed Pilkington is in <strong>Cheviot, Ohio</strong>, a suburb of Cincinnati in Hamilton county in the south-west of the state:</em></p> <p>Carol Ann McIlmurray, 56, is precisely the kind of person Romney needs to attract in large numbers here today.

But others were allowed to stand, including the cutting of the number of days for early voting which contributed to the huge queues that meant some people <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/05/campaigns-legal-battles-swing-states\">waited more than eight hours to cast a ballot</a>. </p> <p>The Republicans say the new measures were necessary to combat fraud. But as the American Civil Liberties Union has noted, more people are attacked by sharks in Florida than convicted of election fraud. That has helped fire up some of the president&apos;s supporters who see Florida&apos;s Republican party machinations as trampling on their democratic rights. </p> <p>But many Republicans who declined to vote for John McCain four years ago because he was not conservative enough, care less about the candidate they will be supporting this time than the opportunity to get rid of Obama. The place to watch – and where I will be – is Hillsborough county, around the Tampa area. Where it goes, Florida goes. In 2004, George Bush won the county by 3%. Four years later, Obama took it by the same margin. </p> <p>The polling stations are likely to be less of an ordeal for voters, in part because there are many more polling stations on election day proper than for early voting. The weather&apos;s horrible though. After weeks of sunshine, suddenly it&apos;s grey and raining. Not the best day for standing in line.

What happens here today could well determine the outcome of the whole presidential race: Mitt Romney really needs to win this state if he is to have a chance of unseating Barack Obama from the White House.</p> <p>I&apos;m going to spend today on a triangular journey through the electoral landscape of one large section of the state to sample its diversity of political complexion. There&apos;s going to be a lot of driving involved across Ohio&apos;s monotonously flat plains, but I&apos;ll be counting on country music and the rants of Rush Limbaugh on talk radio to keep me going.</p> <p>First stop is a suburb of Cincinnati, one of Romney&apos;s most crucial target areas and where Obama campaigned Sunday (see picture below). This area is traditionally very conservative, the heartland of Ohio&apos;s God-fearing, straight-living south-western people. But in 2008 Obama became only the second Democratic presidential candidate to win in Hamilton county in which Cincinnati is situated since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.</p> <p>After that, it&apos;s a two-hour drive due north to Greenville, a country town in the rural west of Ohio. This is pure Republican country, dependable and unwavering. McCain swept Darke county in which Greenville is located by a resounding 68% to Obama&apos;s 30%.</p> <p>The outcome here is not in doubt – for such a deep red county to turn blue would require a magician to pour some potent liberal potion into the local drinking water. But it will be interesting to see how dyed-in-the-wool conservatives are feeling about Romney&apos;s prospects, and the future of the country if he loses tonight.</p> <p>Then I will cut across country due east to the state capital, Columbus. The city is very mixed politically. It has a buzzing university scene as home to Ohio state university, which lends it a lot of Democratic-voting young people. In 2008 Obama won Franklin county around Columbus handsomely, by 59% to McCain&apos;s 40%.</p> <p>But the city also acts as the state&apos;s main financial centre and has a deep conservative tradition. I&apos;ll go to a polling station in a northern suburb, where political opinion is very mixed to take soundings there about which way the wind is blowing.</p> <p><em>Ed Pilkington in Cincinnati</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1468dee4-e522-4638-9e06-3a9ee2c297c8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/6/1352207674001/4de6e7c6-bc92-4f8a-9331-b0ecbfa5555b-460.jpeg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama greets supporters as he arrives at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 4 November, 2012.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama greets supporters as he arrives at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Sunday.

About 100 million Americans are going to enter a booth or lean over a machine and vote today (<a href=\"http://elections.gmu.edu/early_vote_2012.html\">nearly 32 million</a> have voted already). With any luck we&apos;ll know who the winner is sometime tonight.</p> <p>Every presidential election is significant. That&apos;s true of this one, only more so. The candidates have described sharply contrasting plans to strengthen the economy, secure the nation and attack the debt. They are beholden to constituencies with radically different visions of what an ideal American society would look like, what rights it would guarantee and what laws it would enforce. Apart from the alma mater they share, the candidates differ in their life stories and as men, in their casts of mind, in their approaches to problems and to people. Both are outsiders, in their ways. After today&apos;s election, the story of each man will be rewritten for good. As will the country&apos;s.</p> <p><strong>Our correspondents are on the ground in eight battleground states to cover the action at the polls.</strong> We&apos;ll be talking to voters all day long to find out how they cast their ballots and why. We&apos;ll watch out for polling station delays or irregularities.

We're here for something far more basic, and even more exciting. Take a closer look.</p><p>You will notice that near every terminal sits a small green circuit board. Slightly bigger than a credit card, with cables sprouting out of it like twisted limbs, it resembles a rectangular spider. In fact, it's a computer, busily driving and connecting all the disparate elements around it to create… well, whatever the geeks want it to. Say hello, ladies and gentle-nerds, to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/raspberry-pi\" title=\"\">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi is a robust, cheap (about £25), low-powered programmable computer. It is a British invention that went on sale for the first time in February this year and has been a science sensation, the computing equivalent of tickets to Glastonbury or the Rolling Stones: everyone wants one, not just hardcore fans. Before it even launched, demand for the Pi outran supply, and the day the first 10,000 became available, the distributing websites all crashed. The first ever BBC online video of the RPi – a preview of it, before it went on sale – got more than 800,000 views in a matter of days. Since then, the RPi has shifted almost 500,000 units and is on target to top 1m by Christmas – topped up by purchasers from South America and China who haven't been put off by the import costs which turn the RPi from bargain to just cheapish. It's been used to take photographs of the Earth from near space and snaps of birds in back gardens. And it has united the science community, from primary school teachers to particle physicists, in joyous enthusiasm; mostly because they hope its price, size, software and sturdiness (you can shove it in your pocket without damaging it, supposedly) will make it appeal to kids, and thus lead children into computer programming.</p><p>So let's see, shall we? From 9am until 5pm, an unremitting stream of young kids wander into the dim room at Cern, look around for a free monitor, and sit down in front of it. They spot a small cat in the right hand top corner of the screen. Someone – an adult, another child – tells them they can make the cat move if they program it to do so. And then the kids do so.</p><p>Mickal, who's six, is as charming an advert for the RPi as you will ever meet. \"Watch the cat,\" he says. \"He can dance.\" He drags and drops commands across the screen. The cat walks and turns around in circles. Later, he shows me that he can switch some tiny lights on and off using the RPi. \"Press N and enter,\" he says. \"Now N, space and enter.\"</p><p>Nancy, seven, is also enjoying herself. She's given the cat a friend, a horse who makes odd noises, gallops into walls and bounces back. \"We don't have a computer at school, except sometimes for maths. I don't play computer at home either. I like drawing. And I like this.\"</p><p>Nearby, Thomas, seven, is having a go too. Is he enjoying himself? \"I like it a little bit,\" he says. \"It's fun, but sometimes when you get a bit stuck, it gets annoying, and you want to do something else.\" He looks a little wistfully at the door, and at the bright sunshine beyond.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-398873310'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/11/2/1351876984854/Raspberry-Pi-001.jpg' alt='Raspberry Pi' width='220' height='127' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Six-year-old Mickal and his father show Miranda Sawyer a few of the Raspberry Pi’s tricks at the Cern programming event. Photograph: François Wavre/Rezo.ch</figcaption></figure><p>Since the RPi's launch, it has had almost perfect press, and you would have to be a far more cynical hack than I am to scoff at its ideals. Its developers are six highly qualified Cambridge-based scientists, and its principles are pure of heart. The <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\" title=\"\">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> is a charity whose sole aim is to promote the study of computer science in schools; the Raspberry Pi was born from that aim. If the foundation had been a business rather than a charity, the original six could have retired by now.</p><p>The geek buzz around the RPi – let's not forget it's been around less than a year – has been phenomenal. Now there are events like the one at Cern held all over the place: Manchester, Machynlleth, Silicon Valley, Singapore. Called Raspberry jams (do you see?), and not officially endorsed by the foundation, they're essentially just local people getting together and sharing knowledge about the RPi. Here at Cern, on the Swiss-French border, organiser Dr William Bell is concerned with the lack of computer science in local schools (his kids attend a French primary which, at the moment, doesn't have a working computer for the children to use). Thus his jam involves teachers, kids and parents. Others have been more grown up, with lectures and demonstrations, people standing in front of large screens, making jokes in computer code.</p><p>The jams are just one of the RPi-inspired offshoots that have sprung up since the launch. The point of the RPi is that, contrary to most of today's computers, it doesn't come bundled with everything you require. To make it work, you need a keyboard, a screen, an SD memory card, a vast array of cables… So RPi packages have become available, enabling you to buy all those accessories in one go. And if you don't want to program the operating system on to the memory card, there are pre-programmed ones available. If you don't like the idea of it knocking about without a case, several people have designed those.</p><p>More interestingly, there are now add-on boards that expand the Pi's capabilities, to make it easier to use for physical computing and give it functions like driving motors, making lights flash, turning your Lego man into an actual moving robot. These include the Gertboard, designed by a member of the Raspberry Pi Foundation team (called Gert). And <a href=\"http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/interface.htm\" title=\"\">Pi-Face</a>, which is similar, though slightly easier to use (no soldering required), and is the baby of Dr Andrew Robinson of Manchester University.</p><p>Robinson, a friendly, funny man, tells me about the bird box some of his students have designed using an RPi and Pi-Face; the box has an infrared light beam, so the RPi knows when a bird is coming in and out and can activate a camera or send you a message. Robinson also uses his RPi outside work; at the moment he has one at the centre of a theatre show. The RPi syncs interactive projections with lighting and sound, which all respond to the movements of the dancers.</p><p>What else? Manchester University is running the Great British Raspberry Pi Bake Off, a competition for kids to design an exciting use for the RPi; it's sending out RPis and Pi-Faces to the developing world, places like Bangalore and Kenya, where the RPi has caused a sensation but has been hard to come by. \"I don't think the Pi is going to change the world,\" says Robinson. \"But it has opened stuff up, and created an excitement around programming that I've never seen before.\"</p><p>The creators of the RPi are of a generation that played <em>with</em>, rather than o<em>n</em>, computers. Their first consoles were BBC Micros, Commodore 64s, Spectrum ZXs: beige boxes with limited power that offered limited built-in entertainment. In order to really enjoy yourself, you had to tinker about with what your computer could do: change some of the coding and see what happened. If you could do that, you could bring that programming skill to any other computer. But once computers improved, became more powerful and better to play games on, they became harder to program. The tinkering aspect was lost, and this affected swaths of schoolchildren: they just didn't come into contact with programming, even though they had more access to computers, better games consoles, lessons in ICT.</p><p>Eben Upton, a friendly, upbeat man (everyone involved with the RPi is friendly) is a designer of microchips for <a href=\"http://www.broadcom.com/\" title=\"\">Broadcom</a> and the main designer of the RPi. In the early- to mid-2000s, he was in charge of undergraduate admissions to computer science at Cambridge. He noticed a massive drop-off in the numbers and, especially, quality of undergraduates between 1996, when he graduated, and 2005.</p><p>\"The students just couldn't program, and that's because they hadn't been in the presence of programmable hardware,\" he says. \"It's not so much an education as an environment thing. I was self-taught, so were all of my friends. But in the consumer device world we're in today, where the majority of devices are tablets and phones and set-top boxes and games consoles… these are all machines that you can use to consume, but most of them won't let you produce.\"</p><p>Everyone I speak to about the RPi is insistent that anyone can code, whether or not you're good at maths. Bell, at Cern, says it's like messing around with a motorbike. \"You spend your time taking it apart, putting it back together. Only by doing that will you understand how the engine works.\"</p><p>Upton defines programming as \"breaking problems down into manageable pieces\", and the RPi, when you boot it up, has a couple of programming languages already in place: Scratch, which is the basic one with the cat, and the more sophisticated Python, which, once you've mastered it, leads you to pretty much any programming language you want. \"The Pi isn't just a magic box that does stuff,\" says Eben. \"You can start Python, enter six letters and straight away, you're in a programming environment.\"</p><p>All of which sounds terrific, and terrifically exciting. Modern kids love computers, so why wouldn't they love programming? Well… The most identifiable characteristic of the computing genius is that he (it's usually a he) is Other. In the new Bond film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/28/skyfall-james-bond-review\" title=\"\"><em>Skyfall</em></a>, Ben Wishaw's Q is as cute as can be, with his specs and wayward fringe, but he is, essentially, the lofty opposite of hero Bond. Q sits in a dark room looking at a screen; Bond runs around hitting people and snogging.</p><p>This divide isn't new; it's in every school you go to. The nerds hang in the computer room during break time and make obscure jokes; the jocks run around hitting things and trying to chat up girls. There are other cliques – those who cluster in the art room, the alternative music crew – but it seems to me that, admirable though the foundation's intentions are, they'll find it hard to convince many teenagers that programming is for anyone other than geeks. Even if they do get RPis in there early.</p><p>Eben admits that this is something he and his compadres think about a lot. He (and the rest of the foundation) is aware that, so far, about 80% of RPis have been sold \"to geeks like me\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-398873311'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/11/2/1351876106322/Raspberry-Pi-011.jpg' alt='Raspberry Pi' width='220' height='327' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Raspberry Pi was designed to be cheap enough that all youngsters might have a chance to learn programming. Photograph: Phil Fisk for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>\"We don't want to end up entrenching all the advantages that are already there,\" he says. \"There is a fixed-size pie – sorry, but it's the best word – which consists of white, male, middle-class people who are good at maths. Let's say that pie is divided up into particle physicists, investment bankers and computer scientists, which are all careers that are dominated by white, male, middle-class people who are good at maths. If you're not careful, then all you're doing is moving the dividers around that pie of people. What we need to do is expand the pie itself.\"</p><p>In his day job, designing computer chips at Broadcom, Upton insists that he doesn't use a tremendous amount of maths: \"My job is more of a craft.\" And he thinks that emphasising the craft element of programming might help with that stubbornly non-expanding pie – particularly with girls. What the Raspberry Pi Foundation doesn't want to do is what he calls \"painting it pink\" – meaning trying to appeal to girls in a trivial way.</p><p>There's another pie-growing aspect, he thinks, within the vast sector of teenage boys who love computer games. \"There are loads of boys between 12 and 16 who would love to step up to the next level and actually create their own games. But there's no obvious route, and I say that as someone who set up a computer games company straight out of university.\" Now, he would just tell such lads to go and get an RPi, play around with it for a couple of years and then take their portfolio to a games company.</p><p>Another tricky thing about the Raspberry Pi is teaching. It has been pretty convincingly proven that the ICT classes of the 1990s did nothing much more than produce students who would make good secretaries; today's emphasis on online isn't useful either. (As Eben puts is: \"The not particularly helpful skill that students have has changed from being able to use PowerPoint to being able to build a website.\") But how can teachers teach students computer programming if they don't know how to do it themselves?</p><p>\"It's ridiculous to ask teachers to teach stuff they don't feel confident about,\" agrees Eben. \"We need to make teachers feel comfortable.\" Yet, he admits, if teachers are trained to be great programmers, then they'll just leave teaching and go and earn loads more money. \"So we have to find a way to make this stuff deliverable by non-specialists.\" To this end, the foundation – along with many other associations, such as <a href=\"http://www.codeclub.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Code Club</a> – has been encouraging computer engineers to help enthusiastic teachers set up after-school&nbsp;clubs.</p><p>And what about parents? I'm white, female, middle class and studied maths and further maths (not very well) at A-level: I wouldn't have a clue what to do if my kid came to me with a programming problem. Upton admits that here, too, the RPi isn't perfect, yet.</p><p>\"At the moment, we can deliver a really satisfying educational experience in a supervised environment, say where an adult or older child who really knows about computing is looking over a young child who doesn't. The real challenge is delivering to people like you, people who aren't natural-born computer programmers who can answer every question a kid has without even thinking about it. The Pi has to work in a computer-phobic environment. I think it's doable. And it's absolutely key.\"</p><p>The Raspberry Pi isn't perfect, but that's a decision made by its creators. As much as it can be, the RPi is open: its software is open, and so is its attitude – unlike, say the closed, smooth perfection of Apple. The RPi's creators welcome suggestions, and understand that this is a work in progress that can only be moved along by the contributions of other enthusiasts.\"</p><p>Upton tells me to wait a few months before buying an RPi, because in that time, the foundation will overhaul the software that comes bundled with it, especially Scratch, so that it is faster and more stable. (They've already put more RAM into the RPi, increasing it to 512MB; and recently announced that every piece of RPi software is now open source, meaning unhidden and accessible.) Also – and this seems key to me – RPi will be bringing out teaching materials.</p><p>In the end, though, you can lead kids to the RPi, but you can't make them all code. And that's fine. Because some will become obsessed. One of the many, many online videos on RPi was made by George, nine, who has a blog called <a href=\"http://talkietoaster.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">My Journey With Java</a>. He made it in August and it shows him putting leads into his RPi and talking through what each one does. As he puts in the power cable, he breaks off a shiny silver part of the Pi. If George were my child, I'd hand him some Blu-Tak. George just tweets the video to the Pi Foundation and they get back to him and tell him what to do.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/About/General/2012/10/31/1351705085603/A-Raspberry-Jam-session-a-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/04/raspberry-pi-programming-jam-cern","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2012/nov/04/raspberry-pi-programming-jam-cern","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Millennium development goals – the key datasets you need to know","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-31T15:46:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/31/millennium-development-goals-key-datasets","fields":{"body":"<p>The UK is hosting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/31/david-cameron-post-2015-aid-mdg\" title=\"\">the first high-level panel</a> this week on what comes after the millennium development goals (MDGs). Progress on the MDGs has been mixed, however, with persistent inequalities both within and between countries.</p><p>We've pulled together the key data on the eight goals. Although the MDG framework may seem overly technical, with its dozens of time-bound, results-based targets and indicators, it's the product of very political negotiations, with some issues receiving more attention and prominence than others.</p><h2><strong>Goal 1) Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger</strong></h2><p>Estimates suggest the MDG target to halve the proportion of people living in \"extreme poverty\" <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:23129612~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html\" title=\"\">was met in 2010</a>, five years ahead of the 2015 deadline. Although poverty has fallen in every region since 1990, however, it is populous countries such as China and India that are driving the global picture of progress.</p><p>The UN has released dramatically revised estimates of global hunger, suggesting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/datablog/2012/oct/09/mdg-halve-hungry-people-within-reach\" title=\"\">the MDG target is \"within reach\"</a> – despite growing anxiety over high and volatile food prices.</p><p>Even at current rates of progress, however, an estimated 1 billion people will live on the equivalent of $1.25 or less a day in 2015. Rising inequality – both within and between many countries – prompts questions about whether development programmes should pay as much attention to the rich as to the poor.</p><p>Some counter that the targets set the threshold for progress too low – the hunger target, for example, uses an estimate of the minimum number of calories needed to maintain a sedentary lifestyle. The goal's third target, to \"achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all\", has received relatively little attention.</p><h2><strong>Goal 2) Achieve universal primary education</strong></h2><p>This month, the education for all global monitoring report said the MDG target to ensure all children complete a full course of primary school by 2015 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/16/mdg-education-missed-fears-aid\" title=\"\">is likely to be missed by a wide margin</a>. The number of out-of-school children has fallen to about 60 million, from 108 million in 1990, yet progress has slowed since 2004.</p><p>Although more children go to school than ever before, critics argue that enrolment is a bad proxy for whether children are learning. An <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/15/tanzania-uganda-kenya-literacy-numeracy\" title=\"\">August report</a> from civil society group Uwezo, for example, said that although access to education has expanded in east Africa, the quality of learning has stagnated. David Archer, head of programme development at ActionAid, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/23/children-school-learn-literacy-education\" title=\"\">has argued</a> \"it is a violation of children's rights if they are in school year after year yet fail to develop basic skills\", but cautions against a \"reductive focus on literacy and learning outcomes\".</p><h2><strong>Goal 3) Promote gender equality and empower women</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-398632280'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/31/1351691043385/women-legal-rights-data-001.jpg' alt='women legal rights data' width='140' height='220' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Get the data <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jul/06/un-women-legal-rights-data\">here</a></figcaption></figure><p>Eliminating gender disparity in schools is the only official target for this sweeping MDG.

The latest UN figures suggest child deaths fell by nearly half between 1990 and 2011, from 12 million to 6.9 million.</p><p>UN officials say both rich and poor countries have the means to tackle child mortality, as many under-five deaths are attributed to largely preventable causes. But, if anything, the past 20 years show sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia moving further apart from the rest of the world in terms of progress. In 2011, 82% of all under-five deaths occurred in these two regions.</p><h2><strong>Goal 5) Improve maternal health</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-398632282'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/6/11/1339428482690/Health-related-MDG-progre-008.jpg' alt='Health-related MDG progress check' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Get the data <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/datablog/2012/jun/14/race-against-time-health-mdg\">here</a></figcaption></figure><p>The World Health Organisation says the world has experienced a \"significant reduction\" in the number of maternal deaths over the past 20 years – from 543,000 in 1990 to 287,000 in 2010. However, current trends will not meet the MDG target, which aims for a three-quarters reduction in maternal mortality by 2015.</p><p>This goal also tracks access to reproductive health, the prevalence of contraception and the \"unmet need for family planning\". These issues have long been among global development's most contentious and politically charged, though there are signs that family planning is rising up the agenda amid concerns about population growth.</p><h2><strong>Goal 6) Combat HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-398632283'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/31/1351691567705/hiv-data-001.jpg' alt='hiv data' width='140' height='220' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Get the data <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/datablog/interactive/2011/dec/01/world-aids-day-hiv-data-2011-map\">here</a></figcaption></figure><p>Globally, new HIV infections were 21% lower in 2010 than at their peak in 1997, and 15% lower than in 2001. But progress on tackling HIV and Aids varies significantly by region with, for example, new infections continuing to grow in the Caucasus and central Asia. More people are living with HIV, and the UN estimates a total of 2.5 million deaths have been averted in developing countries since 1995 because of anti-retroviral drugs.</p><p>However, progress has fallen short of the ambitious targets of having halted and begun to reverse the spread of HIV and Aids by 2015, and achieving universal access to treatment by 2010.</p><p>All regions appear to be on track to meet the MDG target to halt and begin to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases such as tuberculosis. However, concerns remain about challenges such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health/2012/oct/17/tuberculosis-world-health-organisation\" title=\"\">multi-drug resistant tuberculosis</a>, and the global conversation is shifting to pay more attention to \"non-communicable\" diseases such as diabetes and cancer.</p><h2><strong>Goal 7) Ensure environmental sustainability</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-398632284'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/31/1351694617129/Water-data-001.jpg' alt='Water data' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Get the data <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/mar/22/who-water-sanitation-goals\">here</a></figcaption></figure><p>In March, the UN announced that the MDG target to halve the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/mar/06/water-millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">had been met in 2010</a>, five years ahead of the 2015 deadline.</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://devpolicy.org/note-ban-ki-moon-wrong-on-water-mdg/\" title=\"\">some have contested</a> whether the indicator – which tracks use of improved water sources such as piped supplies or protected wells – is an appropriate proxy for \"safe water\". Others point out that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/apr/20/global-sanitation-target-under-threat\" title=\"\">MDG target to improve basic sanitation</a>, such as access to latrines and hygienic waste collection, will not be met by 2015.</p><p>Other targets under this goal aim to mainstream sustainable development in country-level policies and programmes, and reverse the loss of biodiversity and environmental resources.

However, unlike the other goals it doesn't include a list of specific time-bound targets, making it harder to hold rich countries to account.</p><h2>Data summary</h2><p><a name=\"data\"></p><h2>Download the data</h2><p></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApF51UgS889tdDJydjRLcUlhRlJqcjNTNHhRb1p2WHc\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a></p><h2>More data</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><h2>World government data</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p><h2>Development and aid data</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p><h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2><p>• <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br />• Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/31/1351697690552/Pre-school-boy-reading-001.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/31/millennium-development-goals-key-datasets","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/31/millennium-development-goals-key-datasets","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Kenya building a digital future in Africa's silicon savannah","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-30T16:41:00Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2012/oct/30/kenya-silicon-savannah-digital-technology","fields":{"body":"<p>If there is such a thing as an African version of California's Silicon Valley, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19903839\" title=\"\">the country that is arguably leading the race to the future is Kenya</a>.</p><p>Household tech names such as Google, Intel, Microsoft, Nokia and Vodafone all have a presence here, and IBM recently chose Nairobi for its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19258863\" title=\"\">first African research lab</a>.</p><p>Kenyans enjoy faster broadband connections than their counterparts in Africa's economic powerhouse, South Africa. And the government plans to build a $7bn (£4.36bn), 5,000-acre technology city  that is already being branded <a href=\"http://www.konzacity.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Africa's \"Silicon Savannah\"</a>.</p><p>How did Kenya – a nation that still has its share of poverty and ethnic conflict – get here? \"It started as a joke,\" said <a href=\"http://www.cck.go.ke/about/board/bitange.html\" title=\"\">Dr Bitange Ndemo</a> permanent secretary at the information and communications ministry. \"We said we wanted to beat South Africa – and we did it.\"</p><p>For years Ndemo, a workaholic whose typical day runs from 5.30am to 11pm, found himself bogged down in talks with other African countries about linking to an undersea fibre optic cable that would bring high-speed internet access to millions of people.</p><p>\"I did a calculation: we were spending more on hotel rooms discussing it than laying the cable,\" the 52-year-old recalled. \"So we broke away and went it alone. South Africa thought we were joking. We didn't know anything about cables; I stayed up overnight reading about it on the internet.\"</p><p>That was 2007, Ndemo said, and two years later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jul/23/east-africa-broadband-revolution\" title=\"\">Kenya landed the cable in record time</a>.</p><p>Since then the country has gone from fewer than 6,000 broadband connections to 6m, and from fewer than 3m internet users to 18m.</p><p>In Ndemo's grand vision, technology is not an optional luxury but rather central to 21st century education, development, economic growth – and ending Africa's reliance on foreign aid. He has ambitions for \"e-learning\" in schools across Kenya. \"After the cable landed, we gave unlimited capacity to all the universities.</p><p>\"Access enables us to become more innovative. Broadband allows people to build things you never thought of. Four or five years ago you could not put the words 'Kenya', 'innovation' and 'research' in the same sentence. Now it is starting to happen.\"</p><p>Ndemo, who holds a PhD in industrial economics from Sheffield University, also has a dream of online government. He claims that <a href=\"https://opendata.go.ke\" title=\"\">Kenya is the first country in Africa to adopt open source data</a>, allowing researchers to study everything from health records to weather patterns. He wants census information to be updated in real time instead of once a decade. \"We are trying to have real time digital villages.

I remember when we said we'd liberalise the sector, someone said: 'You won't come out alive.' But it was the best liberalisation ever.\"</p><p>The government has sought to avoid the over-regulation that has hindered tech entrepreneurs in many other countries. The tech workforce also benefits from relatively strong schools and universities.</p><p>There is a buzz and sense of possibility here. Kenya now has an estimated four million Facebook and three million Twitter users. In a few years mobile phone penetration has grown from less than 20% to 85%, driven by cheap tariffs and services such as five-year-old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2007/mar/20/kenya.mobilephones\" title=\"\">M-Pesa</a>, which enables users to pay for goods by transferring money from one phone to another. About 17 million Kenyans, more than a third of the population, use M-Pesa and it is taking off around the world.</p><p>The current <a href=\"http://www.ihub.co.ke\" title=\"\">nerve centre for Nairobi's tech community is the iHub</a>, which brings together entrepreneurs, hackers, designers and investors. It has generated 45 start-up companies since it was founded two years ago. Smart but not luxurious, on a typical day rows of young programmers sit on bright yellow chairs tapping at laptops.</p><p>The iHub was founded by Erik Hersman, an American raised in Kenya and Sudan who blogs under the name \"White African\". Initial funding came from the success of Ushahidi, a website initially developed to map reports of post-election violence in Kenya which has become a platform for crowdsourcing and visualising data used in 156 countries.</p><p>\"Ushahidi and M-Pesa both prove something,\" Hersman reflected, \"If you build it in Africa, it will work anywhere. There's a whole strata around that world that needs products that won't be built in Europe.\"</p><p>The iHub has been visited by industry luminaries such as Marissa Mayer, the president of Yahoo, and Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia. Hersman, 36, added: \"People from the US or Europe come to Africa because they think there's more upside. It's the last blue ocean for tech. It's untouched still.</p><p>\"People here have more spending power now than 10 years ago. At the same time everything related to tech is decreasing costs. You have a great opportunity where people say, 'I can get in while it's still nascent'. It's still raw here. It's good to get market share before the big dogs come in.\"</p><p>One of the mobile apps operating from the iHub is <a href=\"http://mfarm.co.ke/\" title=\"\">M-Farm</a>, which allows farmers to get wholesale market information and sell their products via basic mobile phones.</p><p>Linda Kwamboka, 24, one of three female co-founders, said: \"It was August 2010 and we saw so many farmers complaining about unfair commodity prices, saying: 'We're not getting the benefit of our sweat.'\"</p><p>M-Farm is now updated daily with the help of data collectors on the ground and has been used by more than 5,400 farmers so far.</p><p>\"Technology is driving so many things,\" Kwamboka said. \"Entrepreneurs are coming up and there's an opportunity to change people's lives.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/29/1351534159988/Turkana-women-examine-pho-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/kenya-silicon-savannah-digital-technology","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/oct/30/kenya-silicon-savannah-digital-technology","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Africa's top 10 tweeting politicians","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-30T13:54:00Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2012/oct/30/africa-twitter-blogs-politicians","fields":{"body":"<h2>Nana Akufo-Addo (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nadaa2012\" title=\"\">@nadaa2012</a>)</h2><p>Leader of the New Patriotic party and presidential candidate in Ghana.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-398588417'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/29/1351536032289/Nana-Afuko-Addo-003.jpg' alt='Nana Afuko-Addo' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>1,640 tweets 35 following 6,132 followers</p><p>The opposition leader is <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/10/ghana%E2%80%99s-presidential-candidates?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/battling_it_out_online\" title=\"\">hoping social media can propel him to victory</a> in forthcoming elections.

The cost of buying and transporting books means they often have to be shared between students in a classroom, hindering learning and slowing development. Yet e-readers have the potential to change this.</p><p></p><p>Intimigom nursery and primary school in the rural Maasai province of Kilgoris, south-west Kenya, is attempting to overcome textbook shortages by using donated e-readers. The e-readers come loaded with hundreds of Kenyan textbooks in English and Kiswahili, as well as stories for primary school children. When electricity shortages occur, they can be charged using small solar power packs and generators.</p><p></p><p>\"I had never seen a Kindle before; I really like using it as it helps me with reading and writing,\" says Intimigom student Obuto Kukutia, aged 12.</p><p></p><p>\"We have a seen a lot of positive changes since we started using Kindles. The children are very excited to learn and are often reading through their break. It helps them with their spelling and [English] language skills. Compared to other schools I have taught at, the children here appear to be ahead. The parents' reaction to the Kindles has also been very positive; they wonder how such a small device can hold several books,\" says the headteacher, Shadrack Lemiso.</p><p></p><p>The school has 150 e-readers for the 200 students. It is supported by the <a href=\"http://www.thekilgorisproject.com/the-kilgoris-story.html\" title=\"\">Kilgoris project</a>, a not-for-profit organisation that – partnered with <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org\" title=\"\">Worldreader</a> – provides e-books to schools in sub-Saharan Africa. Worldreader works with publishers including Penguin, Random House, and Amazon, as well as African authors and publishers, to ensure <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/our-books/\" title=\"\">local and international books</a> are available and affordable, if not donated for free. It has distributed more than 220,000 digital books to children and teachers across four projects in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p></p><p>\"We saw the technology as the most effective and efficient way to give our students all the known benefits of access to books. Instead of building a library, the technology lets us put a library in a child's hand. And we can keep that library up-to-date electronically. E-books don't get tattered or torn, like their paper cousins,\" says Caren McCormack, president and co-founder of the Kilgoris project. \"At the launch ceremony at Intimigom, I joked that the Kindles were much like a herd of cows, a source of long-term security and prosperity for a family. And who could better protect a precious herd than a group of Maasai?\"</p><p></p><p>Sporadic internet connectivity in the area means only a small number of books can be downloaded at a time; for downloads to all the devices, the e-readers are taken to Nairobi, where high-speed internet is more readily available.</p><p></p><p>The Kilgoris project helps seven schools in the province, serving more than 600 students. Each has an active local board and leadership team consisting of parents, elders and teachers. \"We rely on these boards for constant feedback, decision-making, direction and support,\" says McCormack. \"We firmly believe that to do the most good and have the most impact, we need to align ourselves to the community's needs through communication with local families.\"</p><p></p><p>By expanding the schools it works with and adding pre-school and secondary levels, Kilgoris aims to help 1,000 students by 2017.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/10/23/1350986039128/MDG--Kilgris-Project-in-K-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/26/e-readers-kindle-learning-children-kenya","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/26/e-readers-kindle-learning-children-kenya","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Mind the gender gap","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-24T12:58:00Z","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","id":"lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/oct/24/mind-the-gender-gap","fields":{"body":"<p>Change is coming when it comes to sexual equality, but there is further proof today that it is taking a long time. For seven years running, a welter of information has been pulled together to assess the \"global gender gap\" in 132 countries.</p><p>We can quibble about the analysis and definitions but, essentially, the report prepared by the World Economic Forum (WEF) assesses four key areas – health (life expectancy, etc), access to education, economic participation (salaries, job type and seniority) and political engagement. This year, the <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap?utm_source=gendermap&amp;utm_medium=map&amp;utm_campaign=Gender%2BMap\" title=\"\">WEF has come up with a new interactive data map that you can play with here</a>.</p><p>There is a lot to study in this report (which I haven't done in depth yet), but the gist is that, while there has been much progress in closing the gap in healthcare and education (with notable exceptions), \"gaps in senior positions, wages and leadership levels still persist.\" This applies even in countries in the developed world, where as many women as men go into higher education and lots of them work. The UK, where just 3% of the top companies are led by women and where women account for only 22% of people in parliament, has slipped from 15th to 18th over the past two years.</p><p>Sixty per cent of countries had managed to narrow the economic gender gap in the past year, but only 20 per cent had made any change on a political level. Just six countries had shown an improvement of 10 percentage points or more since the report launched seven years ago, while almost 75 countries have improved by less than five points.</p><p>Saadia Zahidi, senior director at the WEF and the person responsible for the report, said the issue was an economic one – the need to make the most of one half of the world's human capital. \"If that capital is not invested in, educated or healthy, countries are going to lose out in terms of their long-term potential,\" she said, adding, \"the progress is very slow … even though we are seeing a trend in a positive direction.\"</p><p>The top four countries – Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden – all offer mandatory paternity leave, relatively generous parental leave benefits, tax incentives and post-maternity re-entry programmes to try to help women return to work after childbirth.</p><p>The focus on the political and economic gap comes a day after EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding was forced<strong> f</strong>or legal reasons to<strong> </strong>delay a move <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20039540\" title=\"\">to set a 40% quota for women on the boards of listed companies</a>. Lack of support was also blamed. And it didn't help that another man was about to be appointed to the European Central Bank – an appointment that would leave the ECB executive board all male until 2018.</p><p>The WEF analysis, which uses data from international organisations such as the International Labour Organisation, the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organisation, also results in a table that puts Lesotho and the Philippines in the top 20, above the UK and US.</p><p>One last point to note: no country from the Middle East or north Africa – areas of huge current conflict – are in the top 100. Proof that more gender equality often equates to more political stability?

Unlike most drivers, Colaço is doing something about it.</p><p>The 30-year-old is a research manager at Nairobi's <a href=\"http://ihub.co.ke/pages/home.php\" title=\"\">iHub</a>, a tech innovation centre where Kenyans brainstorm ideas. She is helping her team develop intelligent traffic lights to ease the chaos in the city considered to have the <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/35359.wss\" title=\"\">fourth worst commute in the world</a>.</p><p>\"I hate driving in Nairobi. There is no management on the junctions … It becomes a deadlock,\" she said. City officials estimate traffic jams cost east Africa's largest economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (£365,000) a day. \"It's about measuring the traffic density and congestion … and instead of pre-programming the traffic lights, you make them intelligent,\" she added. \"The idea is to have them spread across the highway so they are talking to each other.\"</p><p>What Colaço is suggesting is not revolutionary: other cities around the world use smart traffic lights. But if her team is successful, and if drivers buy in, it could spur a mini-uprising in a city where most traffic lights are ignored by drivers, and overruled by poorly trained police.</p><p>The project grew out of one of the regular robotics boot camps run by the iHub, set up in 2010 by the founders of <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a>, a non-profit, open source platform for crowdsourcing information during disasters. The iHub, where wannabe developers huddle together at small tables in an airy fourth-floor room, is part of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/03/kalonzo-musyoka-technology-city-kenya\" title=\"\">Kenya's booming tech industry</a>.</p><p>Colaço says the project is a \"bare bones\" assignment – and when a research assistant, Juliette Wanyiri, 22, brings out the prototype, it looks more like a child's game than the answer to the paralysis already spreading along Ngong Road four floors below.</p><p>The model has three coloured pins representing the traffic lights, linked by pink, green and yellow wires to a motion sensor, a camera and a mini-computer. \"It's a simulation model, whereby we have a microcontroller with the traffic lights and we have the sensors that sense the congestion,\" Colaço said. The system is due to be tested on Ngong Road soon. \"If the traffic reads higher than our benchmark then the red light should go off and the green light should go on,\" Wanyiri said.</p><p>Along Ngong Road, one of Nairobi's busiest arteries, people wondered whether drivers could be persuaded to obey traffic lights, even smart ones, in a city where the rules of the road seem to be open to personal interpretation.</p><p>\"Even if you bring in new [lights], if someone is used to breaking the law, he will continue with that habit,\" said Joseph, a financial services worker.</p><p>Overtaking on the wrong side of the road, driving the wrong way, or dodging boulders placed to stop vehicles from using unfinished bypasses are common in Nairobi. A few drops of rain can bring the city to a standstill. At night, traffic lights are ignored, not least because in this rich-meets-poor city, stopping is seen as an invitation to be mugged.</p><p>Colaço believes people will change their driving habits if they see the system works.</p><p>The undisputed kings of highway anarchy are the drivers of <em>matatus</em>, Nairobi's public minibuses, who are widely condemned for speeding, failing to indicate and stopping in the middle of junctions.</p><p>Dante, who collects money and shouts out destinations, doubts smart traffic lights would hold much sway with <em>matatu</em> drivers, and had his own ideas about what should be done. \"At each and every junction, they should have a cop because then the jams will be easier,\" he said.</p><p>The iHub project is just part of a broader effort to get Nairobi moving. New bypasses and an eight-lane superhighway have been built and in August, the World Bank said it would invest more than $300m to develop a <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/08/02/kenya-launch-rapid-road-rail-transport-ease-urban-traffic-congestion\" title=\"\">mass rapid transport system</a>.</p><p>The iHub researchers can only dream of such funding. Laughing, Colaço and Wanyiri show off their financial war chest: a glass jar with a couple of shillings rattling in the bottom.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/8/1349716450661/Kenyan-traffic-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/nairobi-smart-traffic-light-congestion","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/oct/22/nairobi-smart-traffic-light-congestion","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Who controls the internet?

The trick is to not use the word governance...</p><p>Google's <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/104413069545565696542\">David Drummond </a>stuck up well for Google's position in support of the open web, which might support the company's business position but, he argues, also provides opportunities for the developing world. We need an open internet for innovation to flourish.</p><p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/102033129777839332130\">Alexander Ntoko</a> from the International Telecommunication Union did a good job explaining how the organisation works. Why shouldn't the public look to their governments to protect them from cybersecurity threats? That's fine as long as you trust your government. But, he said, ITU proposals also reflect international law, so defused the criticism that some proposals would threaten free speech. ITU is subject to Article 33, for example.</p><p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109913625686513025659\">Alice Munyua</a> from many places, but especially Kenyan government internet policy, was a much needed voice on the needs of the developing world. She said the internet in Africa was growing but still has low levels of access, with only 40 million users in Kenya. Trying to increase access to affordable broadband was still a big issue, and the ITU was important in helping this, but we should be able to collaborate internationally to deal with issues of cybercrime to protect the vulnerable such as young girls who might not know how to protect themselves. </p><p>And <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/114883350507853176436\">Eleanor Saitta</a>, most recently with the International Modern Media Institute, explained how the internet is under threat of militarisation, so how can we trust governments to protect us when they are simultaneously engaging in cyber-sabotage and surveillance – sometimes against their own citizens? No single organisation, she says, can impose a top down governance on the internet because it is a self-organising network. </p><p>Is it in the interest of the public that the internet is fragmented into political, corporate or ethical sub-domains? The answer was equivocal – the internet must stay together. That's one valuable conclusion on a debate that ended on a high. The goose that laid the golden egg is safe for now.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/19/1350660286272/image-of-Jemima-Kiss-at-G-009.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/oct/19/video-highlights-google-hangout-jemima-kiss","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2012/oct/19/video-highlights-google-hangout-jemima-kiss","sectionName":"Technology"}]}}
