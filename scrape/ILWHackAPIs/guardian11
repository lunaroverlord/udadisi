It is hoped that, because they're made only for Macs, users will notice improved speed and functionality - not to mention fewer of the irritating   crashes that can bedevil Mac-using surfers of certain sites.  </p><p>Top of the list for MacSnobs like me is the @mac.com email addresses - although you'll have to move smartly to snap up the remaining prime addresses. There is also a HomePage service, allowing fast set-up of a personalised web page on Apple's newly beefed-up servers.  </p><p>Parents will appreciate the KidSafe service, which will allow users to block out web sites unsuitable for young eyes. Apple claims the filter is intelligent enough to block sex sites while still allowing kids to, say, do research for a biology project on animals' mating habits - unlike some rival services. And an Apple innovation wouldn't be complete without a nod towards aesthetics - which, in this case, is the new iCard greetings card service, a design-aware alternative - for Mac users only - to the generally pretty tacky e-card offerings elsewhere on the web.  </p><p>Why is Apple doing all this? Well there is, of course, a price to be paid to enter this world   of exquisite taste and usefulness. You've got to have a Mac, and the latest Mac OS 9, which, presumably, is the payback.    </p><p><strong> Christmas clearout</strong><br />  Got any unwanted Christmas prezzies?

Some of the things going cheap are so strange it's almost worth registering and logging in just for a browse.  </p><p>A quick foray this week found an unwanted Honda superbike, discarded BMW 3-Series lowering springs (still boxed - but what are they?) and several Sega Dreamcasts, including one going for only &#163;100.  </p><p>Shouldn't Sega be worried?    </p><p><strong> A new type of web ring</strong><br />  And, if by some freakish chance you manage to raise a four figure sum from offloading your unwanted lowering springs, why not splash out this Valentine's day at trendy upmarket jeweller's Van Peterson? The store is urging us to \"engage yourself in cyberspace\" by buying a ring through its website, at <a href=\"http://www.vanpeterson.com\">www.vanpeterson.com</a>. The site is fast and beautifully laid out, filled with stunning sparklers like the &#163;5,600 Pelham ring. There's only one question to ask with something like this: how many people are prepared to make a purchase this big without coming eye-to-facet with the item itself?  </p><p>Sorry...how unromantic.    </p><p><strong> Expanding horizons</strong><br />  Or how about getting away from it all? Microsoft's Expedia website ( <a href=\"http://www.expedia.co.uk\">www.expedia.co.uk</a>  ) has announced it is dropping the requirement to register to use its services.  </p><p>The move comes after figures from Jupiter research showed that 40% of users are put off sites which demand their details before giving them full access. Expedia includes content from the Rough Guides series of books, a travel magazine, fares information and the ability to book online.    </p><p><strong> Chance for a spree</strong><br />  BT's comparison shopping website, <a href=\"http://www.btspree.com\">btspree.com</a>, is running a big giveaway until the end of the month.

The vouchers are valid until the end of next year.  </p><p><strong> Lion kings and jungle prints</strong><br />  \"Printer consumables\" and \"environmental awareness\" are two words not normally associated - but that was before the advent of Canon's new World Wildlife Fund website at <a href=\"http://www.canon-wwf.com\"TARGET=\"_NEW\">www.canon-wwf.com</a>. Canon is the first conservation partner of the WWF, and has launched a site full of pictures of endangered animals to help sell its products. There are \"desktop animals\" to download, plus the chance to win a family safari holiday in Kenya, or scanners and printers, plus links to WWF factsheets. You can also collect WWF-licensed endangered species cuddly toys - when you buy things like BubbleJet printer consumables.

Nope - the cool bit's going to be the video you create to go with your MP3 track.  </p><p>OK, perhaps not quite that cool - we've all seen the scratchy, jerky efforts that stagger down the line using streaming media players like RealPlayer. But the Lava MusicVideo Player, from MP3 music people Creative Labs, displays information and graphics sequences to show as the song is being played - a first step towards fully-fledged, MTV-style videos for MP3.  </p><p>For now, Lava says the software, available in beta form at <a href=\"http://www.lava.com\">www.lava.com</a>, will at least make it easier for musicians to get their work noticed. <br />  Neil McIntosh</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/jan/13/onlinesupplement6","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/jan/13/onlinesupplement6","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Ten years after: Cricket in 2000","webPublicationDate":"2000-01-02T20:58:42Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/2000/jan/02/cricket7","fields":{"body":"<p>The impression is that nothing changes in cricket, that it is permanently stuck in the mud. At international level this is obviously nonsense. There have been major changes in the last decade and there are more to come. Sometimes the speed of that change has been surprising.</p><p>A decade ago I was asked to concoct a piece on the year 2000 by The Cricketer magazine. Some of the predictions were on target, though the elevation of Mr Mark Nicholas to the post of Chairman of Selectors seems to be taking slightly longer than anticipated. I was emphatically wrong on two issues; the introduction of women to the MCC and - maybe more importantly - the return of South Africa to the cricketing fold. I assumed that neither would take place until beyond 2000.</p><p>The international cricketing community will continue to expand. In the nineties back came South Africa and Zimbabwe were introduced; in this decade expect Bangladesh to secure full Test status; maybe Kenya will follow. England have always been wary of widening the base of international cricket as their attitude to the latest arrivals, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, betrays, but they can hardly object now. Recently the England team have been unable to beat either of these sides. They could do with some opponents that are obviously inferior especially since New Zealand no longer come into this category.</p><p>With more teams the international schedule will have to be rationalised. As the globe shrinks tours will become shorter; the Ashes series will last in its present format longer than most but my guess is that by 2010 it will no longer be played over five Tests. Some form of league table for Test cricket will be adopted with the top two sides playing a final every one or two years.</p><p>However it is international one day cricket that needs urgent attention. Countless, haphazard fixtures take place each year from Sharjah to Toronto. Except when the matches are part of a World Cup no one cares a jot who wins them, which leaves the way open to all sorts of skulduggery. A competitive structure for one day cricket needs to be established, also incorporating league tables, to augment the World Cup.</p><p>The marriage between TV and cricket will continue to be prickly but essential for the survival of the game. The players may crave privacy on the field and in the dressing room; the directors will want to stick microphones and cameras in every possible cranny. Modern technology will enlarge the role of the third umpire. The two umpires out in the middle will phone their friend ever more frequently, checking whether the ball pitched outside the line of leg stump or whether an edge is discernible. But they not the third umpire should be the final arbiter. Mistakes will be reduced but there will be no shortage of controversy.</p><p>At home the cynics will have it that 18 teams will still be battling away in the equivalent of the Benson and Hedges Cup in April 2010, so intransigent are the counties. Those in the shires argue that they have actually compromised significantly in the last decade: they have accepted four day cricket and two divisional cricket as well as pouring money into their academies as encouraged by the ECB.</p><p>Will there still be 18 counties? It's odd. Just about everyone agrees that there are too many sides yet in 2000 there is one more first-class outfit than in 1990 with Durham's elevation in 1992. The counties are hardly likely to vote for their own abolition, but drip by drip a genuine two tier system will probably emerge. </p><p>Currently there is the safeguard of three up, three down in the two divisional system that has been introduced for both Championship and one day cricket. Soon that may become two up, two down, then maybe one up, one down in an attempt to create a genuine premier division, where all the best players reside and where, theoretically, the standard is closer to Test cricket than it is now. This is England's major headache. The gulf between first class cricket and Test cricket is too great. The consequences of this are that our new international players have to try to learn their trade in their first few Tests. The ostracism of overseas players, a suggestion, which to my amazement, is still advanced, would only make that gulf wider.</p><p>On a more cheerful note someone - perhaps even the ECB if they can find some money - will surely have the enterprise to construct a stadium with a roof and lights that is dedicated to cricket. If ever there's a climate that cries out for such a facility, it is ours. And this would offer scope for a winter county league to keep our pros honest and in employment.</p><p>Now the easy bit: by January 2010 Sachin Tendulkar will have overtaken Allan Border's aggregate of Test runs, Mark Nicholas will have finished his stint as Chairman of Selectors, Michael Vaughan will have retired as England captain and the pundits will be pining for the golden era of the nineties.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2000/jan/02/cricket7","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2000/jan/02/cricket7","sectionName":"Sport"},{"webTitle":"From David Livingstone to cyberspace","webPublicationDate":"1999-12-31T01:17:18Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/1999/dec/31/4","fields":{"body":"<p>The business set up 122 years ago by a handful of Glasgow Christians to build bridges, roads and railway tracks for traders in some of sub-Saharan Africa's most under-developed areas enters the new millennium in the process of transforming itself into an internet company.  </p><p>The acquisition of the Africa Online internet franchise has placed African Lakes at the forefront of what it predicts will be the next big economic phenomena in Africa.

A pipe bomb on Christmas Eve injured seven police officers. A blast in a pizzeria a month ago wounded 48 people, including a four year-old child who lost a foot. Three weeks earlier a gay bar was bombed.  <P>Three men and one woman were detained in a joint raid by the army, the national intelligence agency and an elite police unit, the Scorpions. The safety and security minister, Steve Tshwete, said that the police had seized mobile phones modified to detonate pipe bombs, and other \"incriminating evidence\" linked to recent blasts. Mobile phones were used to trigger the restaurant bombs.  <P>Among those arrested was Pagad's national coordinator, Abdus Salaam Ebrahim. Police said they were investigating his links to the bombings, but that he would be charged with   the murder three years ago of one of Cape Town's most notorious gangsters, Rashaad Staggie. Staggie, who made a small fortune from drugs, prostitution and extortion, was shot and burned by Pagad vigilantes after his car was surrounded.  <P>Mr Ebrahim was also accused of the attempted murder of a former Pagad leader who quit the organisation, and \"numerous counts of intimidation and extortion\".  <P>The police said that they were preparing to \"rip bare\" the homes of Pagad members in the hunt for more evidence, and that more arrests were expected. But the director of the public prosecution service, Bulelani Ngcuka, said that it could be some time before all the evidence was collected.  <P>\"We are using the latest technology to seek traces of explosives at some of the homes raided. It could take weeks before the full results are known,\" he said.  <P>People in Cape Town feared that the blasts were a prelude to an escalation in attacks over the millennium. Security at most tourist sites had been increased significantly and soldiers have been drafted in to protect a New Year's Eve concert on Robben Island to be attended by Nelson Mandela and President Thabo Mbeki.  <P>The police suspected that the restaurants were targeted in an extortion racket, but earlier this week Mr Tshwete said the bombs were intended to destabilise South Africa.  <P>Pagad began as a popular Muslim vigilante group committed to fighting organised crime and drug trafficking on the Cape Flats, but it adopted a militant Islamic philosophy and found itself in conflict with the authorities.  <P>After the United States air raids on Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for the bombing of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, Pagad took a strong anti-American stance. It is believed to be responsible for the bombing a year ago of the American-owned Planet Hollywood in Cape Town, when two people were killed.  <P>In January, the head of a police task force investigating links between Pagad and bombings was murdered in an ambush on his car.  <P>Two weeks ago the first Pagad member convicted of murder was sentenced to 32 years in prison for a drive-by shooting in which four members of the Junior Mafia Gang were killed. But he could not be persuaded to reveal the names of three colleagues who aided the attack.  <P>Earlier this month the police were embarrassed when they announced that they had caught the man responsible for the pizzeria bombing, only to discover he was a petty thief with a history of false claims.  <P>Yesterday's arrests came after an attempted raid on a police laboratory near Cape Town where experts are carrying out tests on the remnants of recent blasts. However, the police said the raid may have been an attempt to steal seized drugs which are also stored at the site. Three men were detained, including a policeman."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/dec/30/chrismcgreal","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/dec/30/chrismcgreal","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"In brief","webPublicationDate":"1999-11-12T02:19:55Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/1999/nov/12/2","fields":{"body":"<B> People flee Sri Lanka town</B><P>More than 100,000 civilians fled the last northern town under Sri Lankan government control yesterday as the military braced itself for an attack by Tamil guerrillas, who have seized several garrisons in one of their biggest string of victories in the 16-year war. <P>The town of Vavuniya \"appears be to empty\", a Red Cross spokesman said. \"Most civilians have fled.\"  <P>An army spokesman in Colombo said: \"We are not going to abandon the town.\" But troop morale is very low.

Moderate spokesmen such as Zaki Badawi of the Muslim College, Mohammed Siddiqui of the Muslim Parliament and Iqbal Sacranie, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, have now entered the mainstream alongside the representatives of the other major faiths.   There is no equivalent to the Chief Rabbi, the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Pope within the Islamic religion. Leaders are effectively self-nominated and must win the respect of the community they claim to represent.<P>Sacranie has done this by carefully positioning himself in opposition to extremist groups such as Hizb-ut-Tahrir (Party of God) and al-Muhajiroun (The Emigrants) which talk the language of world Islamic revolution.  On one key issue, however, Sacranie remains allied with the extremists. He has always been deeply critical of Salman Rushdie and the publication of the Satanic Verses by Penguin. Although he has never supported the fatwa calling for Rushdie's execution he consistently called on Penguin to pulp the book, which he believed was an offence to Muslims.<P>It is perhaps significant that Sacranie has first entered the Power 300 list in the year that the Pope has fallen by 70 places and the Archbishop of Canterbury has dropped off altogether. Alongside his role as head of the Muslim Council of Britain,  Sacranie is also the chairman of the charity Muslim Aid and an adviser to the Home Office on Muslim issues.  He was particularly prominent during the Kosovo crisis when he gave his support to the Nato air strikes, which he described at the time as 'an inevitable reaction in the last resort'.  His charity also raised £500,000 for the ethnic Albanians displaced by the Serb ethnic cleansing. This reaction was in marked contrast to the less unexpected outrage he expressed about similar attacks on Iraq at the end of last year. <P> The past 12 months have been extremely important for Britain's Muslims, and Sacranie has been a vocal and articulate advocate during difficult times for the benefit of the wider community. After the nail-bomb attack on Brick Lane he worked hard to allay fears that it was a revenge attack in the wake of the report on Stephen Lawrence's death.  Publicity surrounding the activities of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident held responsible for the terrorist attacks in Kenya and Tanzania, did the image of Islam no favours.  It was further damaged by the incendiary rhetoric of Abu Hamza the Muslim cleric linked to terrorist activity in Yemen.  Sacranie was quick to condemn Abu Hamza, saying there was nothing in the Koran that could be used to support kidnapping and terrorism.<P>  <B><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" size=\"6\">247 </font>Joanne 'JK' Rowling</B>, 34 Author  (-) <BR>\r\n  In recent years there has been much speculation about the decline of the book publishing industry, as Britons appear to favour the PC to the paperback.

Both are meant as compliments. And both relate to the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst's power to deflate and inflate the value of Internet stocks.  In April she remarked in the New Yorker magazine that hi-tech stocks may suffer 'a big correction'. Her comment proved prophetic - or indeed self-fulfilling: as soon as the magazine hit the news stands billions of dollars were wiped off Internet stocks. The following month she advised clients to buy shares in America Online and £6 billion was added to the value of the company's stock.<P>That is the power of this career banker who joined Morgan Stanley back in 1991. Born in Indiana, she graduated from DePaul college in Chicago and later secured an MBA from Cornell. That is when she joined Salomon Brothers as a junior research analyst but it was at Morgan Stanley where she was able to indulge her passion. A series of books in the Nineties including The Internet Report have established her at the pinnacle of the virtual stock market.<P>Just as Yahoo!, Amazon and others were first into their markets, so Meeker was among the first to understand the power of the Internet and bought shares in AOL when they could still be picked up for $2.   According to Kenneth Cukier, international editor on Red Herring magazine, which covers the business of technology, Meeker 'adds nothing to the technology of the net, nor to   the service it delivers Ð instead her profound influence emanates from her ability to marshall the money. So far she has picked winners and made many people rich, and many users happy, due to having used a web service she had the good sense to support.'  With an estimated annual salary of £1.5 million, Meeker is doing quite well out of it too.<P><P><B><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" size=\"6\">259 </font>Edgar Bronfman</B>, 44  President, Seagram Group (-) <BR>  If you are listening to a Sting, U2 or Sheryl Crow CD while reading the Power 300 you will already have put money into the large pocket of Edgar Bronfman.

A few days later he repeats the torture until he is sure he has received more than 1,000 bites. Then, and only then, is it safe for him to travel to the front zone of the navy's war against malaria - countries such as Kenya and Ghana where Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest form of the disease, is rampant. </p><p>Captain Hoffman's behaviour may appear bizarre, but as the malaria parasite has become resistant to conventional drugs such as chloroquine and mefloquine (Larium), the treatment is the surest protection against the disease - and one scientists believe holds the clue to the holy grail of malaria research: development of a vaccine.  </p><p>Next month the World Health Organisation launches a major initiative to encourage pharmaceutical companies and scientific institutions to plough more money and resources into an effective anti-malarial agent for the twenty-first century. Bill Gates, Microsoft software mogul, has donated $50 million to help develop a vaccine for malaria, and the World Bank is expected to follow suit. The concern is driven by the fact that, because of global warming and the collapse of public health programmes in developing countries, malaria is again becoming a scourge. In the past 15 years it has killed nearly 50 million people worldwide (Aids has killed five million). This year malaria will account for 2 million deaths, most of them children in sub-Saharan Africa.  </p><p>In addition, mosquitoes are plaguing Florida and, more recently, New York, and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature predicts the falciparum strain could soon be in southern Europe. One of the reasons malaria is such a killer that children who survive a first bout often do not survive a second. Even those who grow into adulthood will develop only partial protection against the disease.  </p><p>But if the prognosis for natives of malarial regions is grim, it is even worse for tourists and troops visiting the tropics. Chloroquine, the prophylactic of choice since the war, is now only 30 per cent effective in many regions, while mefloquine-resistance, first noticed on the Thai-Cambodian border, is spreading to other areas of South-East Asia.  </p><p>'In Vietnam we lost more casualties to malaria than to bullets. It was the same in Somalia during Operation Restore Hope,' says Hoffman. 'To be effective in combat, we have to develop something that works against malaria, not just today or next week, but long-term.'  </p><p>The point where Hoffman's concerns and those of other scientific researchers coincide is in the hunt for a vaccine that, ideally, would be both a prophylactic for marines and a cure for African children already infected. There is nothing new about Hoffman's 'irradiated-mosquito' treatment. It has been known since the mid-1970s that infection with irradiated mosquitoes carrying the cerebral malaria parasite provides full protection against the disease, but only for a limited time, hence Hoffman's need to 're-inoculate' himself every six months. Essentially, the treatment works by giving patients a weakened form of the disease that allows malarial sporozoites to reach the liver but not to develop to the second stage of infecting red blood cells - the point where patients become sick and feverish.  </p><p>The challenge facing researchers since has been to develop a vaccine that mimics the irradiation effect through biological and chemical means, or a combination of both. But the malaria parasite is a formidable foe - it has a thousand times as many genes as HIV - and defeating it takes time and money.  </p><p>The result is that, although scientists as far afield as Oxford, Melbourne and Bogot&aacute; are keen to claim that their approach offers the better hope of developing a vaccine, there is a fair degree of caution. 'If everything goes well for the leading candidates, there could be a vaccine available in the next 15 years,' says Dr Howard Engers, of the WHO's vaccination development programme. 'But it would be a mistake to be overly optimistic.'  </p><p>At present the vaccines fall into one of three categories: sporozoite or protein recombinant-based, DNA-based or a combination of the two. Pioneering work on sporozoite-based vaccines began at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington DC - not far from Hoffman's Naval Medical Research Centre in Bethesda, Maryland.  </p><p>Having observed the way irradiated sporozoites blocked the disease, army doctor Ripley Ballou tried engineering the same effect biologically, then exposed himself, Hoffman and colleagues to malaria to see if it would offer protection. With the exception of one member of the team the vaccine failed, but some team members exhibited elevated antibody levels, suggesting that protective immunity was possible.  </p><p>The Walter Reed Institute has since developed ever more sophisticated vaccines based on the sporozoite model, culminating with RTS,F which in a small scale trial in 1997 prevented six out of seven test patients developing malaria.  </p><p>Walter Reed is now conducting wider trials in Ghana in co-operation with SmithKline Beecham in Belgium, the results of which are expected in December. But, although the vaccine is at a more advanced stage than its rivals, it seems to offer only short-term protection. Walter Reed is exploring a more sophisticated version of the vaccine, MSP-1, which aims to boost the body's immune response by mimicking the action of the parasite at the merozoite stage, the period about 12 days after infection when young parasites burst from the liver to infect red blood cells. </p><p>In contrast, Hoffman's navy team are pursuing a more scattergun approach, using portions of malarial genes to trigger the same immune response by programming muscle cells to make malaria proteins. The advantage of the DNA approach is that in theory the vaccine can be tailored to be as complex as the parasite itself, training the body to recognise the parasite at every stage of its life cycle and defeating its ability to evolve. The problem is that the technology is still in its infancy and has had to pass rigorous tests before it can be trialed more widely.  </p><p>Last year Hoffman's team immunised 20 healthy volunteers with a malaria DNA vaccine, triggering 'killer T-cells', and established that the vaccine could be tolerated in principle. Next month it is moving to the more critical stage of live trials on four separate groups of volunteers using a vaccine based on five genes that encode proteins expressed by irradiated sporozoites in liver cells.  </p><p>Another approach is to combine a DNA vaccine with a follow-up 'booster' vaccine made by combining a virus such as smallpox with a portion of the malaria parasite. Using this method Dr Adrian Hill, professor of human genetics at the Nuffield Department of Medicine, Oxford, has developed a vaccine known as MVA. 'It is aimed primarily at children in the first year of life in areas where malaria is endemic, but it could work for travellers too,' he says. Trials started last summer and have a long way to go.  </p><p>In a bid to speed up research and encourage more partnerships, this summer Path (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), a Seattle-based non-profit organisation, launched the Malaria Vaccine Initiative. The idea is to use Gates's $50m donation to direct resources to the best vaccine candidates and to fill in the gaps left by drug companies. According to Path, the goal is nothing less than a vaccine that is safe, inexpensive, easy to use and, administered in infancy, confers life-long immunity against all strains of the disease.  </p><p>'The private sector has failed to place a sufficiently high priority on malaria vaccine development - perhaps because the perceived technical risks are too great and the perceived markets are too difficult,' says Gordon Perkin, president of Path. 'From a public health point of view, however, the situation must be remedied.' With a child somewhere dying of malaria every 20 seconds, even a vaccine that guaranteed short-term protection would be welcome.  </p><p>But for Hoffman and his navy research team only lifelong protection will do. 'As far as we are concerned military people can't get malaria at all.'</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/oct/17/infectiousdiseases.observerfocus","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/science/1999/oct/17/infectiousdiseases.observerfocus","sectionName":"Science"},{"webTitle":"'Isn't it marvellous?'","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-11T23:41:19Z","sectionId":"science","id":"science/1999/aug/12/eclipse.internationalnews","fields":{"body":"<p>An observer half a million miles away in space yesterday morning would have seen the moon slip between the sun and the earth, to start a spherical shadow racing from the Atlantic east of New York across Europe in the direction of India, crossing the whole of Europe in less than 90 minutes. </p><p>At 11.15am BST, at more than 1,000mph, the shadow passed over the Channel Island of Alderney, watched by at least 250 astronomers. For the most part, the dark spot fell on broken clouds: a layer of dense alto-cumulus about 7,000ft above the Channel islands with occasional cumulus at 1,500ft. From the ground on Alderney, disappointment promised: the sun even at its full was invisible behind grey cloud.  </p><p>At 9.59, astronomers had promised first contact, the moment when the moon, 240,000 miles from the earth, began to mask light from the sun 93 million miles away. Nobody saw it. At 10.10, the clouds parted a little: the sun appeared suddenly to have acquired a dark tonsure, or skull cap. At 10.23, again at 10.30, and then at intervals of about five minutes, the steadily devoured sun appeared through little breaks in the cloud cover. Thousands applauded, a little despairingly, at a kind of desultory solar striptease.  </p><p>At the first moment of total eclipse at 11.15, the sun began to show itself again. The corona - the sun's upper atmosphere, 1,000 times hotter than the sun's surface but normally invisible - gleamed briefly but clearly. The slate-coloured night of the eclipse lasted a bare two minutes before the first sudden gleam reappeared behind the blacked-out disc that had been the sun. The eclipse still had 1 hour and 20 minutes to run, but for most -even the professional astronomers who had interrupted their annual meeting on Guernsey for the big event - it was over: everything else would seem anticlimactic.    </p><p><strong> Satellite tracks</strong> </p><p>The eclipse was studied by astronomers from Cornwall to the Bay of Bengal; it was observed in all wavelengths, from earth and from spacecraft. British astronomers went to the Black Sea town of Varna in Bulgaria to make images of the outer corona of the sun. A group at the University of Wales at Aberystwyth took instrument readings along satellite tracks to study the density of the earth's ionosphere, the upper layer bombarded by particles from the sun, during the moments of eclipse.  </p><p>In a linked experiment, two teams from the Rutherford Appleton laboratory in Oxfordshire used radio waves to measure the behaviour of the ionosphere during the eclipse. University College, London scientists had been preparing predictions of how the upper layers of the earth's atmosphere would circulate during an eclipse: yesterday, they had a hectic hour collecting data from their instruments.  </p><p>A UCL-Southampton team used state-of-the-art technology in Cornwall to explore chemical processes in the skies in the period of shadow. Lancaster University physicists measured the density of the ionosphere by tuning into the radio waves from distant stars to see how the signal strengths differed from normal. There were other experiments from the ground and aboard two sun-probing satellites called Soho and Yohkoh.  </p><p>For most of the astronomers in Alderney, it was above all a sublime celestial spectacle. Andy Fabian, professor of astronomy at Cambridge, had never seen an eclipse. He had just been involved in the launch of an orbiting x-ray telescope called Chandra, designed to study light from galaxies at the edge of the universe. He had wanted to be an astronomer since he was seven; he had wanted to see a total eclipse since he was a child at primary school. \"1999 was such a long way away,\" he said. \"It's very exciting.\"   </p><p>Iwan Williams, professor at Queen Mary College in London, is an expert in asteroids and comets. He too had never seen an eclipse.    </p><p><strong> 'Just unbelievable'</strong></p><p>It surprised him. \"The darkness came much, much faster than I had expected: it was just unbelievable. The sun came out at just the right time, we saw the Baily's beads and the corona. We were fantastically lucky. Everything happened as we had been told it would, but it is still unbelievable. You could really see how people who didn't know what was happening would be petrified.\"  </p><p>Sherry Fey, 67, of Poole in Dorset, a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, had experienced 12 eclipses and seen nine (three were obscured by cloud). He had pilgrimaged to Montana, Java, Kenya, Curacao and Siberia. \"This one was very short: there were more prominences than average, you couldn't see an awful lot - but isn't it marvellous? It's those last 30 seconds that make all the difference.\"  </p><p>Michael Rowan-Robinson, professor of astrophysics at Imperial College, London, said: \"We saw the night advancing, the lights coming on the ships, we saw the corona for seconds and then at the end this diamond ring effect.

As his reputation spread outwards from Paris in the Twenties to cover the world, the technology of stardom developed apace. Early novels and short stories featuring Hemingway's updated lonesome cowboy were bought by Hollywood, while the new glossy picture magazines, such as Life, feasted on the shooting-and-fishing Hemingway lifestyle. His audience - not always the same as his readership - adored him for being an artist who talked about sports with the same seriousness as he talked about art. Hemingway was a world citizen, equally at home big-game hunting in Africa, sailing in the Caribbean, or scribbling on the Left Bank. By the mid-Thirties, the lifestyle was as celebrated as the prose style. Hemingway the writer had become Hemingway the product. <P>Both are still with us. The latest 'new novel' thrown up by the Hemingway industry, True at First Light, is the seventh posthumous book by Hemingway to have appeared since his suicide in 1961. Some, such as A Moveable Feast and Islands in the Stream, have a degree of legitimacy, being works on which Hemingway was engaged at the time of his death; but others are spurious productions, and True at First Light looks like the most spurious of all.<P>For a start, it is not even a novel, but a first-person account of a safari in Kenya in 1953-4, in which the Hemingways hunt a rogue lion, and 'Papa' takes a black woman, Debba, as his 'fiancee', while his wife, Mary, looks on tolerantly. The manuscript, known for many years to Hemingway scholars as the 'African Journal' (sections were published, under that title, in a magazine in the Seventies), has been boiled down by his son Patrick from 200,000 words to something about half that length, and, by a trick of the light, transformed into fiction. Given such drastic editorial interventions, what confidence can readers have that the book, as published, represents Hemingway's intentions in any significant way? <P>There have been few novelists who laid as much stress on the integrity of a text as Hemingway did. In an interview he gave to the Paris Review in 1958, he stated that he rewrote the ending to A Farewell to Arms '39 times before I was satisfied with it'. Was there some technical problem, asked the interviewer? Yes, Hemingway replied, 'getting the words right'. <P>More than that of most writers, Hemingway's oeuvre is clearly divided into Early and Late - or, to put it another way, Good and Bad. In Paris in the Twenties, he wrote In Our Time (his first and perhaps best book), The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms and Men without Women; all were written before he reached the age of 30, and all read as freshly today as ever. While the following three decades were glorious for the career (he won the Nobel Prize in 1954), they were not half as good for the writing as those early days in Paris. <P>It is often overlooked that the Hemingway of the Twenties was an avant-garde writer, an experimentalist with a deep affinity for C&#233;zanne, whose closest literary model was Gertrude Stein. His subjects were close to home and close to the heart: the shock to a young boy as he comes upon a suicide; the deliberate and meticulous actions of a fisherman who is suffering from war trauma (a fact not mentioned in the story, 'Big Two-Hearted River'); the conflicting dynamics among a group of friends as they head for Spain to witness the annual running of the bulls as a prelude to the bullfighting season.<P>As Hemingway's subject matter became more grandiose, his wonderful prose style, possessing an economy based on rhythmic repetitions, overripened and went to seed ('For Whom the Bell Tolls' is among the most grotesque examples). You can watch the ego swelling and growing uglier book by book, feel the self-delusion oozing from between the sentences. A Moveable Feast, a memoir of bohemian life in Paris, which was published shortly after his death, seemed like a late return to form, but the likely explanation for the quality of that book is that it derives from a collection of manuscripts written in the Twenties, which Hemingway discovered in a box in the Paris Ritz 30 years later.<P>Much of the action of True at First Light is taken up with Mary's desire to shoot the lion which has been terrorising the local Masai villages. Mary forms a bond with her prey which can only be called morbid, and repeatedly voices that pathological link between love and death that burdened Hemingway all his life: 'He's my lion and I love him and respect him', says Mary, 'and I have to kill him.' Once the lion is shot and skinned, she admires him for looking 'so noble and beautiful... He's dignified again as when he was alive.' In addition to the many testimonies to the high esteem in which Hemingway is held by everyone in the vicinity, there are reflections on Paris, yet another swipe at Scott Fitzgerald, and an extraordinary story about George Orwell asking Hemingway for a gun near the end of the war - but little to justify calling these leaves 'a novel'. It would be foolish to oppose the publication of all unfinished work after a writer's death, based on the objection that he or she is not around to sanction it. But readers ought to be made aware of what they are getting into. Works such as this, and an earlier posthumous novel, The Garden of Eden, could have been published in full, with critical apparatus, so that Hemingway's admirers could approach them out of curiosity, and with due trepidation.<P>Hemingway's American publisher has said that they have reached the bottom of the treasure trove. 'This is it. There are no more books.' It is not the end of the Hemingway industry, though. Last October, the House and Home section of the New York Times carried a feature on Thomasville Furniture Industries, proudly introducing the 'Ernest Hemingway Collection', 96 pieces of 'living, dining and bedroom furniture', which come in four themes: Key West, Havana, Ketchum, and - for readers of True at First Light - Kenya.<P>&#149; James Campbell is the author of This is the Beat Generation, published by Secker & Warburg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/jul/04/featuresreview.review10","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/1999/jul/04/featuresreview.review10","sectionName":"From the Observer"},{"webTitle":"The prize fighters","webPublicationDate":"1999-06-30T01:11:03Z","sectionId":"society","id":"society/1999/jun/30/guardiansocietysupplement4","fields":{"body":"<p>The developing world is moving centre stage and justice has overtaken the environment as the issue that moves people to action, say the world's \"alternative Nobel Prize\" winners. The ever-widening gap between rich and poor, within and between countries, is, in their opinion, creating new alliances and uniting networkers, activists and researchers into a growing global movement of radicals who reject labels of \"left\", \"right\" or \"Third Way\". </p><p>The Right Livelihood Foundation's awards have gone, over the last 20 years, to economists, ecologists, community groups, scientific researchers, human rights and environmental campaigners and others who have been judged to have benefited humanity, without recognition from mainstream academia or the political establishment. Mostly they have worked at the grassroots.  </p><p>The alternative Nobels began after Jakob von Uexkull, a wealthy Swede, suggested that the official Nobel Prize be extended to include an environmental award and one for the south. The idea was rejected, but von Uexkull was astonished at people's enthusiasm and decided to endow the awards himself in 1980. The prize money, now $230,000 a year, is shared between three or four winners and the awards are presented in the Swedish parliament.  </p><p>Over the years they have gone to radicals who believe the operation of the world's economy to be fundamentally flawed, and pragmatists, who aim to improve it. So when 70 laureates met to celebrate the foundation's 20th anniversary in Salzburg, Austria, shafts of optimism pierced the professional gloom.  </p><p>The energy guru Amory Lovins, in his Rocky Mountain Institute in Colorado, acts as prophet and midwife for what he calls \"natural capitalism\" which will value and enhance scarce natural resources because it pays to do so. His optimism is contagious. For years he, his wife and 43 staff have advised US governments, corporations and farmers on renewable energy.   </p><p>During the foundation's celebrations, Lovins's fellow laureate Jose Lutzenberger, the Brazilian agronomist and former minister of the environment, consulted him on low-cost solar generators for use in remote areas. Lutzenberger worked for 15 years for a multinational chemical corporation before sounding the alarm against harmful pesticides. He has devised new ways of converting organic wastes into fodder and fertiliser and now finances his organic farming institute with the proceeds of a recycling business.  </p><p>Alice Tepper Marlin is another American pragmatist who thinks the global economy can be made to work better. She won the award nine years ago as founder-president of the Council on Economic Priorities and claims huge progress in consumer awareness and industry response. The council, based in New York and London, issues graded report cards for ethical standards and sustainability.  </p><p>The council's book, Shopping for   a Better World, has sold a million copies and a survey suggested that four out of five readers had altered their buying habits after reading it. Marlin believes \"natural resources are unequally distributed around the world, so are knowledge and technology and access to capital. Globalisation is a redistribution of these things.\"  </p><p>But the radicals, spurred on by the fiery Edward O Goldsmith, founder-editor of the Ecologist, who became a laureate in 1991 \"for his uncompromising critique of industrialism and promotion of alternatives\", insists that only a change in lifestyle and the way society is organised can save the planet.  </p><p>Martin Kohr, another radical, monitors the effects of unfettered   globalisation on the poor and co-ordinates resistance through his Third World Network. The network's Malaysian parent organisation won the award in 1988. Now Kohr feels the recent defeat of the proposed multilateral agreement on investment (MAI) was a turning point. \"It was due to collaboration between the north and south. Civil society in France and many other countries rose up against it - with new alliances forming all the time.\"  </p><p>Kohr says the poor of the south are the main victims of the \"neo-liberal economy\" which is accepted by the world's leaders as beneficial and inevitable. He accuses the \"establishment left\", represented by Tony Blair, of being \"more dangerous than the right because it tries to make globalisation appear progressive. The right didn't try to bluff; it was easier to understand what Margaret Thatcher stood for and thus oppose her. At least we now have a Green movement to fill the vacuum.\"  </p><p>Meanwhile the front line in the battle to stop the World Trading Organisation becoming yet more powerful is the struggle to keep beef hormones and GMOs out of Europe. Samuel Epstein, the British pathologist who won the award last year for his campaigns to expose cancer causing substances, is the EU's leading advisor in its struggles with American corporate interests.  </p><p>Now Epstein is leading an attack on the complacency behind the approval of unsafe substances. He claims that half the people on these committees are American and Canadian officials and industry consultants, the rest miscellaneous \"experts\" with no expertise in cancer, public health or preventative medicine. He plans to demand inquiries into conflicts of interest and competence. The work is urgent because the next phase in the globalisation of trade - the millennial round - begins in November. \"We have seven months to split the EU from the Americans,\" Epstein told fellow laureates.  </p><p>Between the pragmatists and the radicals, a third approach is to side-step the global economy with traditional third-world wisdom. Joseph   Ki-Zerbo, a historian from Burkina- Faso who became a laureate in 1997 for his ideas on indigenous African development, wants traditional forms of solidarity (which he calls \"Africa's socialism\") to be modernised and to replace neo-liberal capitalism - which cannot help Africa because, he says, it fosters systematic unemployment.  </p><p>Ki-Zerbo echoes many voices in Africa and Asia when he insists that development has to be done by people for themselves. Wilfred Karunaratne's participatory Institute for Development Alternatives rescues Sri Lankan village women from money-lenders by forming groups to bargain for credit. His movement has become a national forum on globalisation. In Kenya, Wangari Maathai's green belt movement has planted 20 million trees, and has also become a much wider women's movement for indigenous development. Philosopher Vandana Shiva has championed the development of local centres of industry; and in India, Sunderlal Bahuguna has led a movement to save trees from the chainsaw.  </p><p> Some of the prizewinners are now dead. Ken Saro-Wiwa, whose movement for the survival of the Ogoni people won the award in 1994, was executed in a Nigerian prison shortly afterwards. Petra Kelly, the German Greens campaigner, who won in 1982, also died violently, in an apparent suicide pact. Mordechai Vanunu, the Israeli anti-nuclear activist who betrayed his country's top secrets and won the prize in 1987, is still in prison.  </p><p>Winning the prize can help. Manfred Maxneef, the Chilean economist, was in exile from the Pinochet regime when he won the award in 1983 for his work in revitalising small communities. He judged that the prize would give him enough protection for him to return. It did.  </p><p>Like many eco-pundits, Maxneef believes that globalisation will be reversed in the coming century - but only after a catastrophe in which economic and/or ecological collapse forces the issue. Meanwhile, as rector of the Southern University of Chile, he continues to monitor and help movements of solidarity.  </p><p>The laureates are building closer links for more effective action and an email network is being set up. After the anniversary meeting, the foundation despatched a delegation to Israel to ask the new government to consider Vanunu's release as part of a regional reappraisal of nuclear weapons. Another delegation is preparing to go to East Timor to support the proposed referendum.  </p><p>The development, identified by all the laureates, is the growth of \"stakeholder society\". A multitude of non-governmental groups have begun to fill the vacuum left by politicians who surrender the power of the state to corporations.  </p><p>The leaders of the global opposition have learned how to unite and mobilise in support of human values, human scale and, above all, social and economic justice. </p><p>&#149; Walter Schwarz is co-author, with Dorothy Schwarz, of Living Lightly - Travels in Post-Consumer Society (Jon Carpenter, £15)</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/jun/30/guardiansocietysupplement4","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/1999/jun/30/guardiansocietysupplement4","sectionName":"Society"},{"webTitle":"View from the refugee frontline","webPublicationDate":"1999-05-24T12:29:18Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/1999/may/24/balkans6","fields":{"body":"I am seriously fed up (though I used a much stronger expression in the staff room). It was not just the war picture on the front of the Guardian last Thursday and the photograph of the war-traumatised Kosovan boy who drew it. It was also the television news pictures of refugees being escorted to their Derbyshire primary school with interpreters and local authority support in attendance.<P>At the large south-east London primary school of which I am head, we have been working with refugees and asylum seekers for more than 20 years and about 50 per cent of our present roll comprises refugees or asylum seekers. We have seen umpteen paintings like the one on your front page. They have depicted bullets, shells, bombs, mines and all the technology of war from the perspective of children from Vietnam, Hong Kong, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Zaire, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Bulgaria, Albania, Chile, Turkey, Cyprus, Iraq and Colombia.<P>We have found it incredibly difficult to get interpreters and almost impossible, except in the most exceptional case, to get other support with which to address the emotional needs of children who have seen close relatives shot or bombed, who have themselves been injured, who have no idea of the whereabouts of their father or, less often, their mother, who have moved around, often in danger and at a subsistence level of survival for many months or even years.<P>We have supported families when one parent has been whisked off to jail on suspicion of infringing immigra tion regulations or has been taken into mental-health care, when parents have been denied the right to be with their children by an embassy official in a foreign capital. We have worked with children who feel the effects of the guilt their fathers feel for having played an active part in the atrocities committed by the army units they fought in.<P>Tony Blair visits a refugee camp and that group becomes the focus of attention and official sympathy. This is government by whim. It is particularly ironic that New Labour's rhetoric has moved on from the condemnation of bogus refugees at the same time as they continue to push through the asylum seekers bill and introduce measures which will make the lives of these families much more difficult. There is still, however, no hint that the funding for general refugee action and rights groups will improve or even stabilise. We exist in constant fear that the little bits of money we manage to achieve for particular ventures will disappear.<P>Teachers at my school welcome children of all ages into classes and ways of working that are alien to them. They get children who have experienced violence and survived on their wits to share and cooperate. Teachers work flexibly and creatively to find ways of meeting the very diverse needs of children. The teachers devised and implemented this strategy. There was no support or guidance from outside school.<P>There are huge differences of experiences, expectations and values between the teachers and many of the refugee families. These are generally worked out ad hoc, but because difficulties of recruitment left a small pot of money in the Section 11 budget for last term, we were able to start a new arrivals group.\rIt has been excellent. A trained teacher of English as a second language works with the parents and a teacher works with the children. At the end of the session the two groups get together and the parents learn what the children learnt in school. This was a local authority inspired project and shows that creative thinking still exists in these beleaguered institu tions. This money has now run out and unless we can find alternative funding, the project will cease.<P>But Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, says that poverty is no excuse for under-achieving schools and that schools are adequately resourced. If poverty was all we were contending with we might listen more attentively, and we know additional money makes a difference because we have occasionally had some.<P>A further irony is that during the week when Ofsted launched its report criticising schools for the standards achieved by black and minority ethnic pupils (conveniently ignoring the high achievement of Chinese and Indian pupils) and imputing that teachers are racist, the government much more quietly let it be known that the funding for support for bilingual and pupils from minority ethnic groups (Section 11) was going to be cut.<P>We shall be taking in Kosovan refugees during the coming year. We will welcome them and treat them with respect and consideration. The bombing will probably have finished, but reconstruction is far less headline worthy than destruction so the media will be shining their spotlights in other directions and the politicians will have new interests. Support for the Kosovan refugees will dwindle away and they will be left to survive as best they can. And schools and social services and the voluntary services and the health service and the police will once again be left to struggle on.<P><b>Barry Cole is the head teacher of Deptford Park primary school in the London Borough of Lewisham. </b>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/may/24/balkans6","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/may/24/balkans6","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Southern comfort","webPublicationDate":"1999-02-24T02:56:18Z","sectionId":"society","id":"society/1999/feb/24/guardiansocietysupplement5","fields":{"body":"<p>\r\nMonsanto, one of the greatest advocates of GM crops, says that agricultural biotechnology will play a major role in realising the hope we all share for feeding the world in the next century. Accepting this science, it argues, will make a \"dramatic difference in million s of lives\".</p><p>\r\nBut will it? The world population is 5.9 billion people. It will stabilise somewhere between 8-11 billion, with most growth occurring in the poorer countries. Today, 800 million people are hungry. Food production will have to increase, \r\notherwise we could be faced with crises of epic proportions. </p><p>\r\nSolving hunger is not simply a matter of developing new technologies. We already produce enough food to provide everyone with a nutritious and adequate diet - on average, 350kg of cereal per person. Why so many people are hungry is important, as it tells us what type of improved agriculture would best be promoted, and where this should happen. </p><p>\r\nSome cereal is turned into meat, milk and other animal products, which is energetically inefficient and reduces the total amount of food available. But a more important factor is that most hungry people simply do not have the money to buy the food they need. And if poor farmers cannot afford expensive \"modern\" technologies, no amount of GM technology developed by companies or research establishments seeking to make \r\na financial return will make any difference for them. </p><p>\r\nBut things could be different if farmers had alternatives that were cheap, renewable from year to year, and yet still improved their productivity. </p><p>\r\nSlowly, sustainable agriculture is sweeping the world's farming systems. This is farming that makes the best use of nature's free goods and services while not damaging the environment. It does this by integrating natural processes such as nutrient cycling, nitrogen fixation, soil regeneration and pest predators into food production processes. It minimises the use of non-renewable inputs (pesticides and fertilisers) that damage the environment or harm the health of farmers and consumers. And it makes better use of the knowledge and skills of farmers. </p><p>\r\nThe best evidence comes from those countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America said most to need GM technologies. Where whole communities have been involved in the complete redesign of farming and other local economic activities, regenerative technologies and practices are hugely beneficial for both farmers and rural environments. </p><p>\r\nFirst, sustainable farming is taking root in the resource-poor areas which have remained largely untouched by the modern technologies of the past 40 years. The dividend is per-hectare food output increases of up to threefold. </p><p>\r\nThe second spread is occurring in the higher-input systems where the so-called \"green revolution\" has already had an impact on food output, but where there are concerns over high pesticide use. The dividend comes from reducing use of pesticides - replaced by natural predators, habitat redesign, and multiple cropping - while increasing yields by, typically, 10 per cent. </p><p>\r\nWhat is remarkable is that many of the improvements are occurring in resource-poor areas that had hitherto been assumed to be incapable of producing food surpluses. Highlights include: </p><p>\r\n 223,000 farmers in southern Brazil using green manures and cover crops of legumes and livestock integration have doubled yields of maize and wheat to 4-5 tonnes/ha;</p><p> 45,000 farmers in Guatemala and Honduras have tripled maize yields to 2-2.5 tonnes/ha and diversified their upland farms, which has led to local economic growth that has in turn encouraged remigration back from the cities;</p><p> More than 300,000 farmers in dryland India, using a range of water and soil management technologies, have tripled sorghum and millet yields to some 2-2.5 tonnes/ha;</p><p> 200,000 farmers across Kenya have more than doubled their maize yields to about 2.5-3.3 tonnes/ha and substantially improved vegetable production through the dry seasons;</p><p> 100,000 small coffee farmers in Mexico who have adopted fully organic production methods, and yet increased yields by half; </p><p> A million wetland rice farmers in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam have shifted to sustainable farming.</p><p>\r\nThousands of community-level initiatives are now showing that if farmers are involved in technology development, they can substantially improve the food outputs from farming without damaging nature. </p><p>\r\nMany of these countries are pointing to an alternative future, with sufficient food for all, produced in ways that do not damage the environment. Such a future may involve some GM technology - such as nematode-resistant bananas or virus-resistant rice - provided we are convinced these are safe, do not damage the environment, and that they are supplied to farmers at low or zero cost. </p><p>\r\n Jules Pretty is director of the Centre for Environment and Society at the University of Essex, Colchester.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/feb/24/guardiansocietysupplement5","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/1999/feb/24/guardiansocietysupplement5","sectionName":"Society"},{"webTitle":"\"All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting peace in the middle east.\"","webPublicationDate":"1999-01-20T14:08:33Z","sectionId":"us-news","id":"world/1999/jan/20/clinton.usa10","fields":{"body":"cont.\r\n<p>... they deserve.\r\n<P>All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East.

Last Sunday, after 15 weeks' high level negotiating between\r\n           governments and the input of thousands of independent groups, the director general of the UN\r\n           Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) admitted frankly that there would be 'serious\r\n           failures'. </p><p>           Yet, ever the optimist, the exhausted, undefeated Strong could still insist the next day that the world\r\n           was on 'a real point of civilisational change. I cannot say at this stage that the conference will be a\r\n           success. I believe, however, that that success is in prospect. It's possible.' </p><p>           But how possible? Given governments' entrenched positions on so many items of the agenda and the\r\n           resultant watering down or complete scotching of so many of the proposals, any hopes that the Earth\r\n           Summit would truly set a path to a new world ecoonomic and environmental order are now desperately\r\n           slim. While there may be progress in negotiations at or even before Rio - two more days have now been\r\n           set aside for governments to informally negotiate in Brazil and there will be major meetings in Malaysia\r\n           and London beforehand - so many of the noble intentions that were up for discussion at New York have\r\n           now been negotiated away that it is hard to see how any agreements will have enough bite to be\r\n           anything but rhetoric. </p><p>           Not all is lost, however. Here we present for the first time details of what UNCED wanted, what was\r\n           chucked out in New York and the prospects for Maurice Strong's vision of world environmental security. </p><p>           RIO OVERVIEW: Known as the 'chapeau', this doc ument is vital for the success of the Earth Summit\r\n           because it will set the political tone. New York ended with an agreed text but no decision was made as\r\n           to the political level governments would attach to any agreements. The need for national environment/\r\n           development plans is still included in the text that now goes to Rio , but the important issue of\r\n           follow-ups has not been decided. </p><p>           Prospects: Real progress still possible. </p><p>           BIODIVERSITY: Mexico and Peru argued strongly that the country of origin of plants and animals should\r\n           share any commercial benefits from their use. This received short shrift from the UK and US. Brazil\r\n           wanted a paragraph added to ensure that indigenous people received some of the profits from the\r\n           exploitation of their resources. The US weakened this to say that countries should 'encourage' rather\r\n           than 'ensure' it. </p><p>           Prospects: Small progress possible. </p><p>           BIOTECHNOLOGY: The US took the lead - and a number of countries, including Britain, hid beneath its\r\n           cloaks - in trying to delete all references to safety standards in the development of new products. The\r\n           US also tried to remove all references to women, notably a paragraph that wanted an end to the testing\r\n           of fertility drugs on women in developing countries. The UK, with every developed country, sought to\r\n           keep existing, weak standards. </p><p>           Prospects: Depends on biodiversity convention being negotiated separately. The Rio text is weak:\r\n           developed countries don't want a link to be made between biodiversity and biotechnology for commercial\r\n           reasons. </p><p>           HAZARDOUS WASTE: African countries wanted a world endorsement of the Bamako Convention\r\n           banning the shipment of all toxic wastes across national borders. Only Poland and Senegal supported a\r\n           complete ban on exports of hazardous wastes. Opposition led by EC and US. </p><p>           Prospects: Weak agreement possible but US wants all commitments removed. </p><p>           CLIMATE: Also being negotiated separately as a convention. The US is the only country still refusing to\r\n           sign an agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. It was attacked by Japan\r\n           and Britain, two of its staunchest allies. When Tunisia suggested there should be a study of the per\r\n           capita production of greenhouse gases the US insisted on deleting the proposal. Yemen, on behalf of\r\n           Arab oil nations anxious not to include commitments on the pricing of energy, threw the climate chapter\r\n           back to Rio . </p><p>           Prospects: Depends on more talks at end of April. At the moment everything is in doubt. President\r\n           Bush says he wants to sign agreements but won't accept targets. EC and everyone else wants targets.\r\n           Impasse. </p><p>           CONSUMPTION: The US asked for a deletion of all 16 paragraphs that referred to over consumption\r\n           being a cause of environmental degradation. Canada, New Zealand and Australia blocked this move but\r\n           the US managed to water it down considerably by the end of the negotiations. </p><p>           Prospects: Meagre. Link between poverty and development not accepted because it would affect\r\n           multinational corporations and trade issues. </p><p>           DESERTIFICATION: African countries, feeling marginalised by the North and the G77 nations (who\r\n           include major semi-industrialised countries like Brazil and Malaysia), pressed for a world convention on\r\n           desertification but received little support beyond Sweden and the Middle East. Developed countries,\r\n           including UK, argued that the problem was not global but one of bad economic development which\r\n           caused people to cut down what little remained of plant cover in order to survive. </p><p>           Prospects: There are prospects for a convention after Rio but this in turn depends on a forest\r\n           convention. The South is using desertification to bargain against the North's desire for a forest\r\n           convention. </p><p>           FORESTS: A convention for the protection of forests should still be signed at Rio . Previous\r\n           negotiations broke down when developing countries argued that this was an attempt to take over\r\n           national sovereignty and use the forests as global 'sinks' to absorb carbon dioxide levels and slow global\r\n           warming without the developing countries having to cut back. Compromise reached but equal weight has\r\n           been given to nations' right to fell forests as to protect them. </p><p>           Prospects: The principles so far agreed are tantamount to an international agreement but a convention, if\r\n           signed in Rio , will be weak on protection. </p><p>           TRADE: Curtis Bohlen, chief US negotiator for the summit , has admitted that the free trade rules being\r\n           drafted by Gatt are environmentally bad, but the status quo - that free trade is the best system - was\r\n           hardly questioned. The US line, that free trade and the environment are separate issues and that it\r\n           merely needs a correction in the trade rules to take account of environment costs, prevails. </p><p>           Prospects: Nil. </p><p>           INDIGENOUS PEOPLES: The political rights of indigenous peoples to determine their own development\r\n           is covered in many parts of the conference but was systematically diluted at the New York meeting.\r\n           Some progress has been made (but not in the legal sense) if only because governments now accept it\r\n           as a populist issue. How any agreements would translate into national policies is still unsure. </p><p>           Prospects: Heavy lobbying in Rio from the largest gathering ever of the world's indigenous peoples may\r\n           be important. </p><p>           INSTITUTIONS: Argentina, India, Japan, Kenya and the UK want the strengthening of the UN Economic\r\n           and Social Committee (ECOSOC). Benin, France, Australia, Mexico and the US want an organisation\r\n           called the Sustainable Development Commission to be set up. </p><p>           Prospects: A choice between the two may be made but a third proposal, of a UN 'independent\r\n           ombudsperson' to deal with development/environment appeals may be more acceptable. </p><p>           MILITARY: The US insisted that every mention of the military's role in environment and development be\r\n           deleted. Sweden tried to include the military role in toxic waste problems but the US struck a deal with\r\n           them to knock out any mentions in exchange for keeping a chapter on radioactive waste which the\r\n           Swedes were opposing. India and Japan supported US moves to cut all references to military waste and\r\n           all mentions of military technology for peaceful purposes was deleted. </p><p>           Prospects: Nil. </p><p>           OCEANS: Support and strengthening was sought for existing international treaties. Greenpeace lobbied\r\n           heavily through New Zealand for a ban on whaling, which Iceland and Japan predictably opposed.\r\n           Iceland, to take the heat off them, argued unsuccessfully for a ban on waste dumping at sea. </p><p>           Prospects: Not good because of entrenched positions. The EC was asked to return to Rio with a more\r\n           positive approach. </p><p>           TECHNOLOGY: The US stonewalled the transfer of 'environmentally sound' technology to developing\r\n           countries. Finally agreed, subject to maintaining intellectual property right of companies. Problems over\r\n           transfer of nuclear technology. </p><p>           Prospects: Much to play for. </p><p>           TNCs: Multi-national corporations, or transnationals, control 70 per cent of world trade and as such are\r\n           some of the world's most powerful development organisations. A proposal by China, the G77 nations\r\n           and the Nordic countries that TNCs should accept environmental liability was defeated by the UK, US\r\n           and Japan. </p><p>           Prospects: Nil.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/1992/apr/10/worldsummit2002","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/1992/apr/10/worldsummit2002","sectionName":"Environment"}]}}
