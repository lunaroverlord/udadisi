It was Radio City, rather than Radio Caroline, which was involved in the battle for the Knock John fort with Bates's Radio Essex.</p><p>• A feature which discussed when people with a serious interest in food began calling themselves \"foodies\" said the OED's first citation of the term was from a 1980 article, \"an oozing New York Times magazine celebration of the mistress of a Parisian restaurant and her 'devotees, serious foodies'\".

In developing countries, hunger is a chronic affliction. Images in the media often convey the realities of hunger – emaciated and starving children – in war-torn countries or in the aftermath of droughts, floods, or other calamities. Yet for nearly a billion people in the developed countries, hunger is a day-to-day occurrence, both persistent and widespread.</p><p></p><p>Achieving food security, having \"access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life\", is not as easy as it might seem. Nobel Prize winner professor Amartya Sen was instrumental in pointing out that food security was not just about producing more food, but ensuring the needy had access to it. There can be plenty of food in shops, as was true of the famines in Ireland in the 19th century and West Bengal in the 1940s, but if poor people cannot afford to buy that food (or produce enough on their own), they will go hungry.</p><p></p><p>This is not to say that we do not need to produce more food. As Sen acknowledges, the technologies of the <a href=\"http://canwefeedtheworld.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/the-green-revolution-in-retrospect/\" title=\"\">Green Revolution</a> helped food production keep pace with population growth. Food prices fell and many (although not all) of the poor and hungry benefited.</p><p></p><p>Today food prices are rising again and we are experiencing food price spikes. These are caused by an actual or perceived shortage of grains, but are exacerbated by competition between food crops and biofuel crops, by countries rushing to impose export bans and by a degree of financial speculation.</p><p></p><p>We are thought to be in the middle of the world's third food price spike since 2007. Its effects have been predicted to be moderate, in part because the <a href=\"http://www.amis-outlook.org/\" title=\"\">Agricultural Market Information System</a> (Amis) has given us greater transparency. But recent announcements that the world's grain reserves have fallen to a five-year low and that world grain production for the 2012-13 season is unlikely to match the level of need, due to failing or reduced harvests, have meant the impacts could be worse than originally thought.</p><p></p><p>In order to achieve a food-secure world, we must feed a population expected to grow to over 9 billion by 2050. We must also feed this population in the face of rising incomes and an increase in resource-intensive western-style diets, declining land and water availability and climate change. All of which decrease our ability to produce food for all. .</p><p></p><p>Some 400 to 500 million smallholder farmers from around the world will provide the necessary increased food production and access to food. In many countries, 80% of the population are farmers, as are 80% of the chronically hungry. So why can't farmers, whose job it is to produce and grow food, feed themselves?</p><p></p><p>Mrs Namarunda is an example of the myriad problems faced by smallholder farmers. She farms a single hectare near Lake Victoria in Kenya. She has four children to care for. Without access to fertiliser, or the credit to buy it, she starts each season with a maximum potential harvest of two tons from her land, half of which is enough to feed her family and the other half to generate a modest income. But during the course of the season she is beset by weeds, pests and diseases and is subject to periodic drought, which means she actually harvests less than one ton. She and her children are often hungry and there is no money for schooling or healthcare.</p><p></p><p>So what can be done to tackle these challenges?</p><p></p><h2>Innovation </h2><p></p><p>We need to invest in the development and adoption of appropriate technology. However, there is little or no new land on which to grow crops, and much of what is already farmed is being degraded and eroded – so we need to produce more food from less land, while also using fewer resources.</p><p></p><p>Sustainable intensification aims to do just that. Conservation agriculture, for example, which includes various systems of reduced or no tillage, can protect vulnerable soils from erosion and improve soil fertility while increasing yields and decreasing labour. In experiments conducted by partnerships between local government and <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en\" title=\"\">Concern Worldwide in Zambia</a>, new hybrid maize seeds produced around four to five tons per hectare, compared with one ton per hectare on average across the continent.</p><p></p><h2>Markets </h2><p></p><p>For these innovations to be delivered into the hands of smallholder farmers, we need fair and efficient markets with increased investment of agricultural capital to benefit the poor.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.agra-alliance.org/\" title=\"\">Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa</a> (Agra) has trained and supported over 5,000 agrodealers in eastern and western Africa. The stores sell key inputs to farmers in small, affordable quantities and reduce the distances farmers have to go to get them – in one area of Kenya from 17km in 2004 to 4km in 2007.</p><p></p><p>Similar linkages are also needed to produce markets where farmers can sell crops for a fair price. Middlemen can take all the profit and government marketing bodies have in many cases proved highly inefficient. The alternative is to establish some form of co-operative or contract farming group that can bargain for fair prices.</p><p></p><h2>People </h2><p></p><p>People, especially smallholder farmers, are critical to success and need to drive the changes. Many are women. They provide a critical link between food production, consumption and future progress on food security as farmers, mothers, educators and innovators. If female farmers had access to the same resources as their male counterparts, the number of undernourished people in the world could be reduced by 100 to 150 million.</p><p></p><h2>Political will </h2><p></p><p>Finally, if these interventions are to respond to the needs of the poor and hungry, we will need strong and sustained political will and vision.</p><p></p><p>This type of political leadership can be seen in Ghana under John Kufuor's presidency from 2001 to 2009. Under his leadership, the government invested in agricultural research and farmer education as well as roads, warehouses and cold storage. Ghana's agricultural sector has grown by an average of 5% per year in the past 25 years, while the percentage of the population living in poverty fell from 51% in 1991-92 to 28.5% in 2005-06.</p><p></p><p>Experience shows us that there are grounds for optimism. We can feed the world, but we need to focus urgently and specifically on food security, encourage the leadership to introduce the right policies, invest in research and development and ensure these actions reach the farmers who need them most.</p><p></p><p><em>Sir Gordon Conway and Katy Wilson of Imperial College London are authors of a new book on food security, One Billion Hungry: Can We Feed the World?, </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/One-Billion-Hungry-Feed-World/dp/0801478022\" title=\"\"><em>available on Amazon</em></a><em>.

Or wondered why satellites don't crash into each other? Or why you dial 64 to reach New Zealand, but 65 for Singapore? These are some of the mundane but essential logistical achievements of the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.itu.int%2Fen%2FPages%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkPS1MSVqJVle3MAJ6siz-iQ55Bw\" title=\"\">International Telecommunication Union</a>, a specialist UN agency that dates back to 1865.</p><p>Yet as it gears up for its first global conference in 14 years, the ITU has found itself under unprecedented attack. The first assailant is the powerful US technology lobby. Companies, including Google, are claiming that new ITU proposals would mean internet companies paying hefty fees to local telecoms companies, reigniting historic tensions between US internet giants and incumbent telecoms firms across the world.</p><p>But that's not the only battle that will be played out this December when the ITU's 193 member states gather in Dubai. Russia and China have been explicit in their goal of taking control of the internet away from the US, while developing countries feel the western technology hegemony is limiting their economic opportunities. With the world's internet population predicted to reach 3.4 billion by 2016, there is everything to play for.</p><p>The ITU has not helped its case. Suspected by some critics of encouraging the controversial proposals, comments by the eloquent secretary general Dr Hamadoun Touré seem designed to antagonise the US. He told <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/internet-regulation-war-sopa-pipa-defcon-hacking\" title=\"\">Vanity Fair</a> earlier this year: \"When an invention becomes used by billions across the world, it no longer remains the sole property of one nation, however powerful that nation might be. There should be a mechanism where many countries have an opportunity to have a say.\"</p><p>The reaction to some of these new proposals, or <a href=\"http://www.itu.int/oth/T3F01000001\" title=\"\">ITRs</a>, has been a comprehensive, well-organised and <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/fmr-us-ambassador-david-gross-explains-un-takeover-of-the-internet/\" title=\"\">well-funded campaign</a> by a cabal of <a href=\"http://www.wileyrein.com/professionals.cfm?sp=bio&amp;id=625\" title=\"\">powerful American corporates</a> – including Google, Microsoft, Cisco, AT&amp;T and Comcast. Much of the resulting media coverage of the ITU, particularly in the US, has ranged from dismissive to aggressive, labelling the low-profile union <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/08/the_united_nations_and_the_internet_it_s_complicated\" title=\"\">obscure</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121004/02262820588/why-you-should-be-worried-about-itus-bizarre-claim-to-have-mandate-over-internet-security.shtml\" title=\"\">irrelevant</a> and exploiting American animosity for the UN.</p><h2>Expanding profile</h2><p>Much of the damning coverage has focused on proposed changes to the wording of several ITRs that appear to attempt to expand ITU's remit from telecoms to the internet. Given that the organisation began by co-ordinating telegraph communications and expanded to telephones, mobiles and data, it isn't unreasonable that its members might seek to expand its remit accordingly.</p><p>But its members also include 700 private-sector organisations, and one of those, the European Telecommunications Network Operators (<a href=\"http://www.etno.eu/\" title=\"\">ETNO</a>), has caused the most contention among the US tech lobby by pushing for a <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57518427-38/eu-telcos-defend-un-internet-takeover-plans/\" title=\"\">proposal</a> that would effectively allow telcos to <a href=\"http://www.internetgovernance.org/2012/06/09/threat-analysis-of-wcit-part-3-charging-you-charging-me/\" title=\"\">charge companies</a> for delivering their content. \"What we want is a pricing model that ensures the revenue of operators and allows content providers to better compete in the market,\" ETNO's chairman Luigi Gambardella told La Repubblica this month. For a player like Google or anybody else delivering media over the net, that could prove very expensive.</p><p>Google's chief internet evangelist <a href=\"http://research.google.com/pubs/author32412.html\" title=\"\">Vint Cerf</a> has been one of the big guns rolled out to lobby against the proposed regulations, describing the proposal to return to the \"sender pays\" principle as regressive. He claims that model had failed in the telephone world, particularly in developing countries where paying telcos high settlement rates had supposedly funded infrastructure, but instead ended up in the pockets of government treasuries or officials. \"It's the absolute antithesis of the internet where the participating parties on the edge of the network pay for access to it,\" he said. \"Freedom to innovate on the network has been largely a consequence of its economic model and its openness.\"</p><p>The ad-hoc coalition lobbying against ITU proposals is made up of Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Comcast and AT&amp;T and 10 others, and is chaired by ambassador <a href=\"http://www.wileyrein.com/professionals.cfm?sp=bio&amp;id=625\" title=\"\">David Gross</a>, a lawyer, past chair of several delegations to the ITU, and former government international communications policy coordinator. He represented the group when it testified at a congressional hearing in May.  \"[The sender pays proposal] is asking for trouble because it's suggesting the model, a model that is clearly working, would need to be revised for no apparent, real reason, other than the economic benefit of a few carriers,\" he told <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/fmr-us-ambassador-david-gross-explains-un-takeover-of-the-internet/\" title=\"\">Digital Trends</a> in August. \"I will quickly add that my coalition has major carriers, like AT&amp;T and Verizon, and they also think that this is the wrong way to go.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397915180'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350473525589/world-on-iphone-008.jpg' alt='world on iphone' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Global pressure: the ITU faces attacks from tech giants and hostile governments. Photograph: Paul J Richards/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h2>Campaigning for the open web</h2><p>For its part, Google has campaigned hard under the banner of the open web and the media-genic issues of free speech and-anti censorship that other ITU proposals allude to. But make no mistake – this is absolutely business as usual for a company worth <a href=\"http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GOOG\" title=\"\">$243bn</a> (£150bn) because the sender pays principle – which is said to be <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/261863-us-ambassador-warns-internet-fee-proposal-gaining-momentum-abroad\" title=\"\">gaining traction</a> among African and Arab delegations – would be catastrophic for its business, effectively taxing every interaction with its 700 million or so daily userbase.</p><p>Add to that the threat posed to Google's income by Facebook's monopoly of social data and related advertising and the trend for \"privatised\" data inside mobile apps, and suddenly Google's mission to \"index the world's data\" seems rather more precarious. No wonder Google has made a campaign for the open web such a priority. This is what Google's chief legal officer, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/about/company/facts/management/\" title=\"\">David Drummond</a>, describes as a \"happy coincidence\". \"We are not ashamed,\" he says, \"to say the open web is good for the world, and happens to create good opportunities for business\".</p><p>On the other hand, administration and organisation of the internet has been dominated by the US since Arpanet, the precursor to the modern internet, was established between four US universities in 1969, and a handful of US-controlled authorities followed. The biggest point of contention is <a href=\"http://www.icann.org/\" title=\"\">Icann</a>, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees management of internet address. Icann has responded to global pressure by internationalising its management board, though it is still a California-based non-profit. The US has, however, fiercely defended the root zone, the core domain name and numbering system run by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (Iana) – which remains on contract to the US Department of Commerce managed by Icann. On this, they will go down fighting.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397915181'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/2/1343919312614/Internet-map-008.jpg' alt='Internet map' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Circles of influence: tech giants fear hefty fees to telecoms companies</figcaption></figure><h2>Challenging western dominance</h2><p>Western dominance is the one of the biggest challenges for developing nations, says <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthigf.org/partners/steering-committee-profiles/alice-munyua/\" title=\"\">Alice Munyua</a>, a researcher and policy development expert, representing Kenya and Africa on forums such as Icann. \"It is a big concern for African governments and stakeholders, and not just because of how the internet is governed, but how it is developed from a commercial and technical perspective,\" she said. \"There is a feeling that we are not able to participate or contribute effectively because of the lack of capacity, skills and resources, so there's a digital divide in terms of access, but also in appropriating the internet for our own development.\"</p><p>This, she believes, is the reason most African governments are supporting Arab proposals that countries should be compensated, by websites and internet services, for the flow of internet traffic they generate, and that wide-ranging privacy protections be introduced with exceptions for law enforcement.</p><p>Drummond said he was sympathetic with developing countries who feel excluded from the western-dominated internet industry. \"But the treaty route, and the lowest common denominator approach mandating a certain set of technologies or regulations, is not the way to go.\" Munyua says even finding delegates who understand issues of internet management and governance can be difficult, and that with problems as basic as a unreliable electricity supply, African nations have different priorities when engaging with the ITU.</p><p>Elsewhere in the ITU, the battle for control is more like a cold war. Russia, backed by several Middle Eastern countries and by China, has pushed for more <a href=\"https://dwmw.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/the-itu-and-the-real-threats-to-the-internet-part-iv-the-triumph-of-state-security-and-proposed-changes-to-the-itrs/\" title=\"\">cybersecurity regulations</a> and for more ITU control of domain names: this follows Russian president Vladimir Putin stating last year that Russia aimed to establish \"international control over the internet using the monitoring and supervisory capabilities of the International Telecommunication Union\". It has mooted cutting off internet access for anyone who threatens network security, called for a new UN body to replace Icann, and campaigned, but failed, with a previous UN proposal to create a cybersecurity code of conduct.</p><p><a href=\"http://dymaxion.org/\" title=\"\">Eleanor Saitta</a>, technical director of the <a href=\"http://old.immi.is/?l=is&amp;p=FAQ\" title=\"\">International Modern Media Institute</a>, is also a hacker and security consultant. She warns that one of the biggest threats is the increasing militarisation of the internet. Even as the 193 nations of the ITU meet in December, some of those nations will be silently unleashing state-sponsored cyber attacks on each other, as well as surveillance and censorship on their citizens.</p><p>Occasional reports of this flourishing industry surface; just last month the UK government was moved to block software exports to Egypt after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/09/block-on-exports-surveillance-equipment\" title=\"\">Gamma International</a> admitted selling a product that could remotely copy files, log keystrokes and record video. \"We are seeing governments wanting to get involved in censorship and surveillance and that truly has the potential to break the internet, because it will not function as a network or community where people can collaborate and share,\" said Saitta.</p><p>America's corporate internet industry has already had to battle on home turf, however.

Google was one of the loudest voices in this lobby, putting its sophisticated Washington policy department to work. The campaign, which saw high-profile sites including Wikipedia and Reddit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/jan/18/1\" title=\"\">black out</a> for a day in protest, has succeeded in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jan/20/pipa-vote-shelved-harry-reid\" title=\"\">postponing the legislation</a> for now.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-397915182'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/23/1343060875157/Google--002.jpg' alt='Google ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Public eye: Google's near-monopoly on search is coming under scrutiny.

Google is likely to face an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/15/google-antitrust-microsoft-case\" title=\"\">anti-trust</a> hearing in the US by the end of the year, investigating whether Google gives preferential treatment to its own products in search listings. The European Commission is also building a case against Google; the combination could stop Google expanding its US and UK businesses where Google accounts for 65% and 90% of the respective search markets. The search engine is also fighting a privacy battle against European regulators unhappy at how Google shares data between YouTube, Gmail and its other products. On one hand, Google is preaching for an open web, while on the other operating a virtual monopoly in search.</p><p>The lobby's arguments on cybersecurity look weaker in the light of America's own Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, or Cispa, which was widely condemned by civil rights groups for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/18/cispa-unprecedented-access-internet-privacy\" title=\"\">sacrificing the privacy</a> of its citizens to allow the government to trace hackers. Hot on the heels of Sopa, it was passed by Congress, killed off by the Senate and is now being revisited by the Senate. US defence secretary Leon Panetta claimed this week that the US risked a \"cyber Pearl Harbour\" if it did not resolve its cybersecurity issues. The US government itself was implicated in the development of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/30/state-sponsored-cyber-espionage-prevalent\" title=\"\">Stuxnet and Flame</a> viruses which was intended to derail and spy on the Iranian nuclear programme, and the White House has also claimed it was subject to an attack in October from hackers linked to the Chinese government.</p><p>With so much to contend with on home turf, why, asks internet governance policy analyst professor <a href=\"http://www.internetgovernance.org/2012/06/09/threat-analysis-of-wcit-part-3-charging-you-charging-me/\" title=\"\">Milton Mueller</a>, is the US technology lobby chucking so much firepower at the declining institution of the ITU? They might do better, he suggests, to focus attention on Icann, pointing out problems with how governments engage with the group on advisory committees.</p><p>Mueller says: \"We're all 'prepared to fight the ITU' – but we're ignoring threats that come from Icann, the US government and from nation states.

In the grand new globalised world you didn't have to grow apples because you could ship them from New Zealand or South Africa. You didn't have to worry about peas or beans , they came from Peru or Kenya. Chicken from Thailand; fish from wherever the latest ocean-hoovering operation was destroying future stocks – no cause for alarm there. All you needed was a fistful of pounds, and the food would be there to be bought.</p><p></p><p>There had been the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution\" title=\"\">green revolution</a> from the late 1960s that had saved the world from starvation. If supplies ran short, we'd just have to crank up the technology again and all would be well. Food was cheap for Western consumers, and it was assumed that it would keep getting cheaper.</p><p></p><p>In fact, we never actually were in any kind of global food utopia – even at the best point around 1995 there were nearly 800 million people going regularly hungry in the world, and obesity from inappropriate nutrition, closely linked to the rise of high-fructose corn syrup, trans fats and fizzy drinks, has just kept growing and spreading. And it's become increasingly obvious that agriculture based on petroleum inputs – for cultivation, spraying and harvest; for fertiliser; for global distribution – is going to have to change, fast.</p><p></p><p>But mostly that's been regarded in the UK as an unfortunate global problem, something for the Department for International Development to worry about – and sometimes as almost a positive, as one of the driving factors of the Arab Spring.</p><p></p><p>Yet last week, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer\" title=\"\"> with British wheat yields being reduced by 14.1% on the five-year average</a>, and the latest global food prices <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/161602/icode/\" title=\"\"> going up by 1.4% in September</a>, the issue has again pushed to centre stage, and close to home.</p><p></p><p>Britain is slowly waking up to the fact that relying on the rest of the world for large amounts of foods we could easily grow ourselves might not be a great idea.  Food prices <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/files/defra-stats-foodfarm-food-pocketbook-2012-121005.pdf\" title=\"\">rose 32% (12% in real terms) in the UK between 2007 and 2012</a> while increasing only 13% in France and Germany. The price of fruit has been particularly hard hit.</p><p></p><p>Unsurprisingly, with real incomes squeezed, consumption of this key nutritional item has fallen, at the greatest rate among lowest income households. They're already spending around 17% of their income on food With many also in fuel poverty, they're going to struggle to find the extra money that they'll need.</p><p></p><p>Only 23% of our fruit and vegetables come from the UK  - or 10% when you just count fruit – and those imports are only going to get more expensive. That's if they are available at all.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't so long ago that every British city and town was surrounded by market gardens, orchards and dairies. And that's where we need to be – and can be - again.</p><p></p><p>We need a stable, secure food supply, with a short distance from field to plate. We need to work to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, and cut reduce consumption of meat from livestock few on grain. And we need a decentralised distribution system that's not reliant on a few giant warehouses. That is, not built around a handful of giant, monopolistic supermarkets.</p><p></p><p>As the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/nine-meals-anarchy\" title=\"\">New Economics Foundation concluded in 2008</a>, we're currently operating a system that's only nine meals from anarchy (PDF). We've got a just-in-time food delivery system, which I saw firsthand when my local Green party in Camden had a pop-up shop during the London election campaign. At least three times a day, an HGV would draw up outside the local  supermarket, offloading food that went straight on to the shelves - then straight out the door.</p><p></p><p>Ensuring its people can eat is one of the most basic responsibilities of government. It's time, in its approach to competition law, to planning law, to flood protection, to planning for the future, that our government started to take this fundamental responsibility seriously.</p><p></p><p>If food prices rise sharply, as they're highly likely to do – fruit, vegetables, and the real basics like bread and butter – it's the poorest who'll suffer first and worst.</p><p></p><p>But if food supplies become tight, and post-peak oil fuel costs soar, then the impact on Britain's food supply will be felt by everyone. And the government will have to wonder why, in 2012, it was not taking seriously the need to produce food in Britain, close to where it would be eaten.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/03/22/beans10d.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/15/rely-world-food-supplies","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/15/rely-world-food-supplies","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Boot up: Windows 8 push, Google's antitrust alert, trolls unmasked and more","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-15T05:30:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/blog/2012/oct/15/technology-links-newsbucket","fields":{"body":"<p>A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1GNDs7DCTw\">Windows 8 is Coming Soon &gt;&gt; YouTube</a></h2><p>Microsoft would like you to know this.

While it is the most commonly cited dataset for city and urban population figures, it is an area fraught with difficulty.</p><p>For starters, what's the best way to define a city? Do you stick with often historical legal and administrative boundaries (the city proper)? Do you, perhaps, use population density so that suburban areas are included and city sprawl captured (urban agglomeration)? </p><p>A more comprehensive concept is that of the metropolitan area, which includes urban agglomerations and surrounding areas of lower density \"under the direct influence of the city\". Under that definition, rural populations can be counted as urban, so long as they fall under the direct political or economic influence of a city.</p><p>The municipal district of Chongqing in south-west China, for example, has a total population of more than 30 million – but less than 6 million live in Chongqing city proper. Depending on which classification is used, Chongqing could be listed as the world's largest city, or not even make the top tier.</p><p>The population division of the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs issues estimates every two years (the latest came out in April, the next are due in 2014). To collect the data, the department sends annual questionnaires to more than 230 national statistical offices. But while the <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/unup/Documentation/WUP_glossary.htm\">UN has defined general guidelines</a>, many countries use their own standards.</p><p>Collecting accurate data on city populations is notoriously difficult. Censuses are only conducted once a decade or less – until last year, <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-03/world/togo.census_1_togolese-first-census-parliamentary-elections?_s=PM:WORLD\">the latest census data available for Lomé in Togo was almost 30 years out of date</a> – while urban populations are often highly mobile and unofficial.</p><p>And the results of surveys and censuses can be manipulated for political ends. For example, China reclassified some rural areas as urban in the 1980s to give it greater administrative control.</p><p>The UN is at least <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/unup/CD-ROM/Documentation/WUP2011-DataSource-UrbanAgglomeration-and-CapitalCities1.xls\">transparent about where it gets the city data from</a>, and its population forecasting model is relatively straightforward. </p><p>David Bloom at Harvard, who conducted a recent <a href=\"http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/2010/en_GB/wp2010-12/\">review of urbanisation data</a>, says the main advantage of the UN model is its \"simplicity and transparency\". But he cautions that it can lead to \"quite unrealistic\" projections: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It requires no detailed data and can thus be readily applied across countries. But the main problem with the model is that it does not have any theoretical foundations: all forecasts are pure extrapolations of past trends and, thus, do not distinguish urbanisation generated by migration from fertility or mortality-driven changes in the composition of the underlying population. The model implicitly assumes that all countries will follow the historical path of now-developed countries and does not take into consideration differences across countries.</p></blockquote><p>A much-cited <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iussp.org%2FActivities%2Fwgc-urb%2Fcohen.pdf&amp;ei=ST9kUKXlHI3C0AWIxoHwBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbEAwXoznu-27IUYzNzXgrX4rD5w\">study by Barney Cohen</a>, of the US National Research Council, looked at  UN predictions for 169 countries. Cohen found urban population forecasts made 20 years earlier were on average 14% too high, forecasts made 10 years ago were 17% too high, while forecasts made five years ago were, on average, correct. Projections were most reliable for OECD countries and least reliable for sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income countries.</p><p>The recent, rapid development of global mapping technologies is allowing academics to create more detailed and consistent datasets – although it is a work in progress and the data does not yet have global coverage.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.afd.fr/lang/en/home/publications/travaux-de-recherche/archives-anciennes-collections/NotesetEtudes/Africapolis\">Africapolis</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.e-geopolis.eu/\">e-Geopolis</a> project to map and estimate urban populations around the world, cross-references satellite imagery with data from censuses and other official publications to produce estimates for settlements with more than 10,000 residents.</p><p>Africapolis's estimates and predictions for the population of Lagos differ markedly from those produced by the UN.</p><p>Deborah Potts, at King's College, London, says the UN data used is frequently wrong: \"Of the three largest cities in sub-Saharan Africa, for decades we have only been reasonably sure of the size of Johannesburg; Kinshasa's size can only be guessed, and that of Lagos is deeply contested.\"</p><p>At a national level, Africapolis estimated the urbanisation level of Nigeria at 30% in 2006 – compared with the UN's estimate of 49%.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kcl.ac.uk%2Fsspp%2Fdepartments%2Fgeography%2Fresearch%2Fepd%2FNigeriaUrbPottsOccPaper39.pdf&amp;ei=jEZkUJCbG6LG0QWpuIDABg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGTxvkIFAkvP-Qoc9nDNhlA66wWg\">Potts says urbanisation in Nigeria has been significantly overestimated</a>, with major policy implications: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There can be no doubt that the level has been overestimated as the discrepancy is absolutely enormous: the UN, basing its figures on Nigerian official data, estimated that 69 million Nigerians were living in towns, compared to the Africapolis estimate of 42 million: a difference of 27 million people.</p><p>Far from being rapid, the shift from rural to urban in this part of the world has usually become very gradual or stagnant or, in some cases, reversed. </p></blockquote><p>The rise of megacities interactive uses UN estimates on urban agglomerations with populations above 750,000 from the latest revision to World Urbanisation Prospects. </p><h2>Data

minister reaffirmed on Tuesday Britain's pledge to spend 0.7% of gross-national income on aid by 2013. David Cameron's statement, at the UN general assembly in New York, comes despite growing calls from members of his own party to rein in Britain's aid spending.</p><p>Over the last two weeks, conservative British newspapers, including the Sunday Telegraph and the Daily Mail, have attacked the Department for International Development (DfID) for spending millions of British aid money<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9545584/Poverty-barons-who-make-a-fortune-from-taxpayer-funded-aid-budget.html\" title=\"\"> on a group of highly profitable consultancy firms</a>. The drama has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9560326/British-still-giving-hundreds-of-millions-of-pounds-in-aid-to-wealthy-countries.html\" title=\"\">resurrected</a> a long-standing question, highlighted last year over <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/feb/16/uk-government-aid-india-strategy?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">UK aid to India</a>, about whether donors should spend money on middle-income countries.</p><p>Here are five key datasets to help understand the debates:</p><h2>How big is the UK aid budget?</h2><p>Last year, the UK spent $13.7bn (£8.57bn) on official development assistance (ODA) – what the rest of us call \"aid\". Note that DfID, <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/departmental-report/2012/Annual-report-accounts-2011-12.pdf\" title=\"\">which spent £7.6bn on ODA last year </a> isn't the only government department in charge of UK aid. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the UK Border Agency, for example, also contribute towards the 0.7% target.</p><p>The UK is the world's third largest donor from countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), following Germany ($14.5bn) and the US ($30.7bn). But as a percentage of gross national income (GNI), British aid spending was 0.56% in 2011 – far greater than the US equivalent of 0.20%. Only five OECD countries – Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark, and the Netherlands – have already met the 0.7% commitment.</p><p>What does this mean for the UK taxpayer? With a population of about 62.6 million, last year's £8.57bn spend works out at roughly £137 per head.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApF51UgS889tdDRIRGg3V2dWNEJoR1dLWVRreVphOUE\" title=\"\">• Get the data</a></p><h2>Which countries get UK aid?</h2><p>Last year, DfID announced that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/mar/01/uk-cuts-aid-poorest-countries?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">16 countries would no longer receive bilateral aid from Britain by 2016</a>, as a result of the department's spending reviews.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/mar/01/uk-aid-review-cuts-dfid\">biggest announced increase</a> in aid was for Somalia, with a 208% rise planned between 2010 and 2015. This was followed by Nigeria, with an increase of 116%. By 2015, Pakistan would receive the largest chunk of UK aid – £1.4bn, up 107% from 2010.</p><p>Billions of aid are also spent through groups such as the World Bank, the EU, and UN agencies. Last year, the UK spent <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/departmental-report/2012/Annual-report-accounts-2011-12.pdf\">£5bn on bilateral aid programmes and £3.5bn on multilateral aid</a>. Sometimes funding through international organisations is classified as bilateral aid – the distinction depends, roughly, on how much control the donor has over that money.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdHlLaVZaWjlsbHExVmpnbU41ZDJhYmc&amp;hl=en#gid=0\" title=\"\">• Get the data </a></p><h2>Health or wealth?

But it didn't tell us exactly how money would be spent in those countries.</p><p>To get a better sense of how British aid spending would break down over the coming years, the Guardian pulled out all the data from the country-level operational plans published by DfID, which included tables dividing budgets across the different sectors – from governance and security to education, health, water and sanitation.</p><p>Health and education remain among the top areas for UK bilateral aid. But within sectors, interesting trends are apparent. For example, according to the data, reproductive, maternal and newborn health will consume nearly 64% of DfID's global health funding by 2015, while the share of bilateral aid for HIV and Aids will drop from 16% in 2010-11 to less than 6% in 2014-15.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/datablog/2011/oct/05/datablog-future-plans-uk-aid\" title=\"\">• Read more</a></p><h2>How has UK aid spending changed over time?</h2><p>The UK has a long-standing foreign aid programme. But how has the geography of UK aid spending changed over time? Last year, the Guardian pulled out all the data on UK aid spending since 1960 to follow the money trail.</p><p>In 1960, among the top recipients of UK aid were Cyprus and Malta. One year later, this had already changed dramatically: in 1961, Kenya and India were top recipients. India received the largest chunk of UK aid for most of the 1960s and 1970s. The turn of the new millennium saw an explosion in the number of UK aid recipients.</p><p><a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdGY4VXR1RmRkY0dOUG9jejNEM0JNaEE&amp;hl=en\" title=\"\">• Get the data</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/apr/14/uk-aid-spending-history\">Read more</a></p><h2>The<strong> </strong>business of UK aid</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-398851175'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348672247057/Picture_112.png' alt='DfID's top contractors' width='452' height='291' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Location of DfID's top contractors.

Of nearly 120 major contracts and procurement agreements (together worth almost £750m) published on the government's contracts portal since January 2011, only nine include non-UK firms among the grantees.

Without immediate access to the internet, it took him a day to book a plane ticket. Finding a number to make a phone reservation took time; connecting – on erratic phone lines – even longer; and bank forms had to be filled in to withdraw money for paying.</p><p>\"The fact that something that could have taken less than 10 minutes [online] took a torturous whole day got me thinking: if something like an airline ticket was this difficult to procure, how much worse is it down the economic food chain?\" he explained.</p><p>Akinde, who had worked with US telecoms companies, saw a solution in mobile phones. He came up with <a href=\"https://www.slimtrader.com/\" title=\"\">SlimTrader</a>, a service that allows customers to use their phones to get information and availability, and to pay for services ranging from airplane tickets to bags of fertiliser.</p><p>While in many parts of the world, such a service would use the internet, this option was not available for a large majority of Nigerians using basic feature phones. Instead, SlimTrader can be used entirely by text message. \"We took the idea from what it could be in the western world to what it really has to be in the developing world. We went a step further, and said let's make SlimTrader useable on any phone,\" he said.</p><p>Using text messaging for technological advances makes sense in a continent where hi-tech sits cheek-by-jowl with fading technology. Days before it officially began selling in western stores, bootlegged copies of the latestiPhone were available from Lagos market vendors – many of whom were using phones with only basic internet. And while Google's Lagos office has helped put some 25,000 businesses online in the past year, it is also making its mighty search engine available through the humble text message in Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana<strong>.</strong></p><p>Innovations like SlimTrader are a small part of a new technological revolution in sub-Saharan Africa. In west Africa, which has lagged behind its eastern neighbours, a new breed of home-grown entrepreneurs is adapting technology to local challenges.</p><p>At the centre of that boom is Nigeria, which has come a long way from its early days of the internet, nicknamed \"plug and pray\". A decade ago, just under 1m phone lines served its population of 140 million. Today, the number of mobile phone subscribers has skyrocketed to almost 100 million, using phones for everything from portable music systems on beaches to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gidi_traffic\" title=\"\">navigating notoriously grid-locked roads</a>.</p><p>But despite improving quality and access to digital platforms, technology-based solutions remain patchy and isolated. That motivated Femi Longe and Bosun Tijani to set up west Africa's first technology hub in 2011, which aims to find tech-based solutions to social problems.</p><p>\"If you look at our history and development, the focus has always been to find something that worked successfully somewhere else and bring it here. That model hasn't worked,\" Longe said, in a buzzing room in downtown Lagos, where dozens of aspiring \"techpreneurs\" are huddled over laptops. \"For solutions to work here, they need to be created with an understanding of the Nigerian context and culture.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://yourbudgit.com\" title=\"\">BudgIT</a> helped draw tens of thousands of Nigerians on to the streets in January to protest against proposed government cuts by turning the country's notoriously shadowy budget into easy-to-read infographics. \"In a very short while, BudgIT became the de facto place to go if you have any questions around public finance in Nigeria,\" said Longe.</p><p>Longe shrugs off criticism that social media and the internet remain out of reach for many in Africa. \"If you can reach even 1 million people, that's massive. We may not reach everybody, but we can get our solutions very far,\" he said.</p><p>In fact, some innovations are harnessing the explosive growth of mobile phone owners, <a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/africa-now-the-worlds-second-largest-mobile-market-reports-gsma/\" title=\"\">forecast to swell to 735 million Africans by the end of this year</a>. Phones are being used in a number of ways. MicroEnsure, for example, embeds life insurance premiums in pay-as-you-go top-up cards. A $3 minimum monthly spend gave kettle-maker Rebecca Darko and her family, from Accra, Ghana, a safety net of $140 in life insurance after a family death threatened to drown them in debt.</p><p>In Mauritania's vast Sahara desert, meanwhile, nomadic herdsman Abdel Ould Ely uses his battered, hand-me-down mobile to tackle the ancient problem of crop-devouring locust swarms. From the remote Aioun region, he sends a text message to the <a href=\"http://www.claa.mr/english.htm\" title=\"\">desert locust centre in the capital, Nouakchott</a>, the minute a single locust is spotted.</p><p>\"The hope is that by crowdsourcing from text messages, we can help predict where a swarm is heading, in theory as you can with the weather,\" said Mohamed Abderahmane Ould Sidi, a director at the centre. To do that, the centre relies on the availability of signal in deserts, \"where you can travel 300km without seeing another person\", Ould Sidi said – something unavailable even five years ago.</p><p>Nevertheless, the march of technology has left some by the wayside. Brahim weld-Ben, a tracker in Mauritania, said he can no longer earn an income from his once sought-after traditional tracking skills in the harsh desert. \"There is mobile phone coverage and other technology everywhere now. Most of the time, you can find somebody who is lost just by calling them,\" he said.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/9/17/1347896890636/MDG--Mobile-phone-in-West-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/24/nigeria-mobile-phones-success-technology","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/sep/24/nigeria-mobile-phones-success-technology","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"James Flynn: IQ may go up as well as down","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-22T23:05:25Z","sectionId":"science","id":"technology/2012/sep/23/james-flynn-iq-scores-environment","fields":{"body":"<p>James Flynn studied mathematics and physics at the University of Chicago, before switching to political philosophy. Currently, he is a professor of political studies at the University of Otago in New Zealand. His name has been lent to the \"Flynn effect\" – his discovery that IQ scores have risen significantly from one generation to another over the past century. He is 78.</p><p></p><p><strong>What does IQ measure?</strong><br />That depends what it's used for. Sometimes, an IQ test is a force for good. You have a kid at school who is doing badly and you think he seems brighter than that. You give him an IQ test and he knocks the socks out of it. So it can be used to help diagnose an individual's educational problems. Some universities use IQ tests as part of an entrance exam.</p><p>The second thing they are often used for is to measure the difference between groups. But this works only if their quality of environment is roughly comparable.</p><p><strong>Your book, <em>Are We Getting Smarter?</em>, talks about the recent IQ gains made by women.</strong><br />Women today match men but only in advanced countries, where women get an equal shake. One of the most interesting things is that at university women do have IQs about two points lower than men, maybe three, and a lot of scholars say: \"Ah-ha, that means women aren't as bright\", but why do you think that might be?</p><p></p><p><strong>Is it to do with the type of people who pursue going to university?</strong><br />Well, it has to do with the fact that, if you take a girl of 17 from secondary school with an IQ of 100, she will get better grades than the typical boy. So that means that the girl with the IQ of 100 may well get to university and the boy won't. So the male sample is more elite; it has a higher threshold. This reveals one of the disturbing things about British education: if you look at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics, at the end of secondary school, only the top third of boys matches the top half of girls for reading. In America, only the top quarter of boys matches the top half of girls for written composition. This is why so many women are beginning to dominate journalism and law.</p><p></p><p><strong>If I took an early IQ test, would I find it baffling the way the problems are set?</strong><br />No, you would knock the socks out of it because people who designed the early IQ test were ahead of their time. They were highly professional people who had been schooled in the scientific ethos, and they weren't typical of their day. Let's take a question that you would get and an intelligent person of 1900 might not: if you were asked: \"What do dogs and rabbits have in common?\", what would you say?</p><p></p><p><strong>They are both mammals.</strong><br />Correct. A kid in 1900 would say: \"You use dogs to hunt rabbits.\" He would get the question wrong because, before people had lots of formal schooling, they had a utilitarian mentality, and they were fixated on the concrete world and using it to advantage. You've been raised in a scientific world where you think classifying things is an obvious prerequisite for understanding them. To you, a dog and a rabbit are just mammals; you are not interested in whether it is a beagle and good for hunting rabbits. So IQ gains over time are totally fascinating if you know how to interpret them and don't just run around saying: \"Are we getting more intelligent?\"</p><p></p><p><strong>So these observations show that IQ is determined by environment rather than genes?</strong><br />At the individual level, genes are important, as they are for other qualities such as height.</p><p>It's very different, however, to use IQ to compare groups and say that, because one group has a lower mean IQ, that shows that it is genetically inferior. For example, if you look at developing nations, there are six for which we have good IQ data. Three of these are making gains faster now than we Europeans are. These are Turkey, Brazil and Kenya and I predict that eventually all three of them are going to match us for IQ. As for the three other nations, there is nothing the matter with their genes but with their circumstances. You have Sudan, where they keep having civil wars; you have Saudi Arabia, where most of them are sitting around feather-bedding on oil wells; and you have the Dominican Republic, where they have their infrastructure wiped out every 10 years by hurricanes, tsunamis and tornadoes. There is nothing the matter with their genes, but if Britain had all of its infrastructure destroyed every 10 years, it wouldn't be doing so well.</p><p></p><p><strong>You have also described something you call the \"bright tax\".</strong><br />It has always been thought that bright people's minds deteriorated less after the age of 65. I found that that was true for verbal abilities, but the brighter you are the faster your analytical abilities deteriorate after 65, all the way down the scale. Even the average person deteriorates more quickly than the below-average. That sets an interesting question. Is the good analytic brain, like a high-performance sports car, something that requires more maintenance in old age than the body can give it – that would be a physiological hypothesis. Or is it that we mainly use our analytic ability at work, so that if you are bright you have a cognitively demanding job and when you retire you are like an athlete who has lost his exercise advantage.</p><p></p><p><strong>How would one mitigate this cognitive decline post-65: do crosswords, take up running, learn a new language?</strong><br />Mental exercise will do you good at any age. Even if your brain is deteriorating, it will deteriorate more slowly if you use it. Just as while I can't run 10k anything like [as fast as] when I was young, if you are really out of shape, even at 78, I could give you a hard time.</p><p><strong>Are you going to tell me your time for 10k?</strong><br />When I was young it was 32 minutes, and in those days the world record was around 29. When I was 66, I could still run it in 45½. My ability to run at under 50 minutes has receded since I have entered my 70s.</p><p></p><p><strong>Other than the obvious physical benefits, why do you run?</strong><br />There is no doubt that the blood supply to the brain, due to a cardiovascular system that is efficient, helps intelligence in the pre-frontal lobes; that is true. I don't do it for that reason, but I am sure that I get the benefit.</p><p>There was a wonderful study by the OECD where they gave a test of working memory – what a pity it wasn't a test of analytical ability, but it wasn't – and they divided the countries into those like France, where 80% of people retired between 55-65, and those like Sweden and Switzerland, where 80% were still in work, and the loss on working memory in France for that age was twice as great. Which tells us that, if you kept exercising your brain at work, your working memory held up better.</p><p></p><p><strong>You have written four books this year, including one about climate change.</strong><br />I kept the book under 100 pages, it is called <em>Climate Change and the Environment</em> – I'm looking for a publisher. I guarantee anyone can read it in less than four hours and learn what they need to know.</p><p>My conclusion is that, yes, we are making a contribution. At one time, the climate sceptics had a case, but their case is now falling apart. Keep your eye on the west Antarctic ice shelf: we are in trouble. It looks as if it's going to go, and, even if half of it goes over the next century, that will raise sea levels by three metres, and your beloved London is going to be in a fix.</p><p>Laser fusion is probably the best long-range hope for clean energy: that is where you bombard heavy hydrogen with fusion to try to set up an interaction that would actually generate more energy than you put into it. But that research is probably about 70 years away from being dominant. Before then we are going to need a stopgap.</p><p>Are We Getting Smarter?<em> by James R Flynn is published by Cambridge University Press (£16.99)</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348073572169/james-flynn-iq-scores-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/23/james-flynn-iq-scores-environment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2012/sep/23/james-flynn-iq-scores-environment","sectionName":"Science"},{"webTitle":"Religious restrictions index: how do countries compare?","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-20T15:56:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2012/sep/20/religious-restrictions-index-intolerance-rise","fields":{"body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/20/religious-intolerance-on-rise-worldwide?newsfeed=true\">Religious intolerance is on the rise</a> according to research out today, with restrictions on religion increasing in each of the five major regions of the world.</p><p>The report published by <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Government/Rising-Tide-of-Restrictions-on-Religion-findings.aspx\">Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion and Public Life</a> looks at the extent to which governments and societies around the world impinge on religious beliefs and practices.

The share of countries with high or very high restrictions on religious beliefs and practices has also risen - from 31% in the year ending mid-2009 to 37% the year ending mid-2010.</p><p>Also published in the report is a religious restrictions index with scores by country. In the latest year, ending mid-2010, 18 countries recorded very high government restrictions on religion including countries such Egypt, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. </p><p>The report states that the </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"rising tide of restrictions in the latest year studied is attributable to a variety of factors, including increases in crimes, malicious acts and violence motivated by religious hatred or bias, as well as increased government interference with worship or other religious practices.\"</p></blockquote><p>The percentage of the global population living where levels of restriction are high or very high has risen from 68% in year ending mid-2007 to 75% in year ending mid-2010.

Researchers spoke to over 550 women and men across the five countries being analysed. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/julianborger\">Julian Borger </a>writes today:</p><blockquote><p>The survey of the five countries found that women and girls had a tendency to form groups and coalitions to deal with problems and got on with resolving conflicts up to the point when the process became formal, when the men took over. The higher and more formal the level of peace-building, the smaller the degree of female participation, the study found.</p></blockquote><p>The report also highlights some key indicators such as education levels, labour force participation and the percentage of parliamentary seats held by women. A study by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and UN Women, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/mar/07/women-representation-in-politics-worldwide\">published earlier this year</a> showed slow advances in the political landscape - the number of lower houses hosting more than 30% women having risen slightly from 25 to 30 in 2011. </p><p>Of the five countries studied, Nepal holds the highest percentage of women in parliament at 33% with Afghanistan following at 28%. Sierra Leone records the lowest percentage with only 13% of all parliamentary seats being held by a woman. Click on the chart above to see the data for each country.</p><p>Only 6% of the female population aged over 25 years old are educated to secondary education level, this rises slightly to 10% in Sierra Leone. Pakistan has the highest percentage of all the countries surveyed at 25%.</p><p>The table below shows how the five countries compare by indicators such as life expectancy, labour force participation and maternal mortality rate. Thanks to Unifem, we also have a table of women's participation in 24 peace processes between 1992 and 2008.</p><p>The spreadsheet, which can be downloaded, also contains data on women's participation in justice and security.

In the valley below, a woman pulls a jacket from the rubbish and holds it up, appraising it with a critical eye.</p><p>At Nairobi's Dandora rubbish dump, the working day is in full swing. Men and women pick through a newly arrived truck, looking for plastic, food, clothes, paper and bottles – anything they can sell on or take home to use.</p><p>Robert Ondika, 27, straightens from sifting through the rubbish with an iron hook. He has been working in Dandora, one of Africa's largest rubbish dumps, for three years and earns between 50 and 500 Kenyan shillings a day (between $0.60 and $6). \"We come here to earn our daily bread,\" he says in Kiswahili. \"Here, we touch different things, we could step on something sharp. It is only God who is helping us here.\"</p><p>For these foot soldiers in Nairobi's unregulated rubbish business, the work is perilous and the rewards paltry, to say nothing of the discomfort of spending the day in a smoky, stinking wasteland. But for those who live in the neighbourhoods around the dump, it offers survival.</p><p>That is Dandora's paradox – it is source of life, but also of illness and, occasionally, death. In a <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">report released on Tuesday</a>, <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en\" title=\"\">Concern Worldwide</a>, Italian development group <a href=\"http://www.cesvi.org/\" title=\"\">Cesvi</a> and church group <a href=\"http://www.kutokanet.com/\" title=\"\">Exodus Kutoka</a> say  the dump is \"one of the most flagrant violations of human rights\" in Kenya.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">report</a> says the city council of Nairobi, local government departments and the <a href=\"http://www.nema.go.ke/\" title=\"\">National Environment Management Authority</a> (Nema) bear legal responsibility for the hazardous living conditions in the slums nearby.</p><p>The dump, which lies 8km (5 miles) from the city centre, was declared full in 2001, and since then campaigners, including Concern, have sought to have it decommissioned.</p><p>The report, <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">Trash and Tragedy: The Impact of Garbage on Human Rights in Nairobi City</a>, says the rubbish had polluted the soil, water and air, affecting more than 200,000 people, including up to 10,000 who spend the day seeking treasure from it.</p><p>Most of them do not wear gloves or masks and many suffer from respiratory ailments, such as asthma. Other conditions that have affected workers include anaemia, kidney problems, cancer and frequent miscarriages.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=519&amp;ArticleID=5679&amp;l=en\" title=\"\">2007 study</a> by the United Nations Environment Programme found that at least half the children in surrounding neighbourhoods had heavy metal concentrations in their blood that exceed the minimum level set by the World Health Organisation. Some estimates say around half the workers on the dump are under 18.</p><p>A site for a new dump was earmarked near Nairobi's international airport, but that idea stalled this year when the Kenya Airports Authority said birds attracted by the rubbish could endanger planes.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">Trash and Tragedy report</a> says many workers do not support plans to close the dump, where 850 tonnes of waste are deposited each day.</p><p>Father John Webootsa, who lives nearby in Korogocho slum, understands this. \"It brings money and it brings death,\" says the Comboni priest, who has campaigned for years to have the 30-acre dump relocated. He organises vocational training and loans for scavengers to help them escape.</p><p>\"We believe this is not a life that human beings should live,\" he says. \"Many [people] have died and others are dying. Others have been burned by the acid, the 'boilers' [contaminated industrial waste barrels] that are there. Beneath that garbage, there are boiling chemicals, and people may be burned if they step on them by accident.\"</p><p>Korogocho, which means \"crowded shoulder to shoulder\" in Kiswahili, appears to have been forgotten by the government. On one of the narrow streets, pigs snuffle among piles of rubbish, just yards from the body of a dead dog. Webootsa says people here feel rejected by society and by the government. \"Social amenities are not provided, the government is not here. We do not have a public health facility … there are only two schools, and they were built by us,\" he says.</p><p>But the dump is a source of wealth and power for the men at the top of an informal cartel that runs the site. With no government control, there is plenty of room for gangsters to wield their influence. Visitors must organise and pay for \"security\" to walk around the site and to take photographs.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\"></a>report says powerful business interests have rallied communities against the decommissioning process. \"Most of the anti-decomissioning forces have deeply vested business interests that thrive in the prevailing chaos,\" it says.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">report</a> argues that any solution requires a sea-change in Nairobi, a city of more than 3.5 million people where recycling is non-existent, or ad hoc. \"Residents of Nairobi must take responsibility for their waste … a key step is to demand urgent delivery of a safe and comprehensive waste management system, with a functional sanitary landfill,\" the <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\"></a>report says.</p><p>Concern and its co-authors urge the government to use modern technology to isolate toxic waste in Dandora, and identify a site to build a sanitary landfill.</p><p>Webootsa stresses that any solution must take into account the thousands working as scavengers. \"They don't need the dump. They need the job,\" he says. \"They don't need the rubbish. They will be happy to have a clean environment, they will be happy to breathe clean air, and of course, there has to be a proper livelihood.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/9/13/1347547669793/Dandora-dump-in-Nairobi-K-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/18/money-misery-nairobi-dandora-dump","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/sep/18/money-misery-nairobi-dandora-dump","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"The power within to embrace contentment","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-18T13:00:06Z","sectionId":"theguardian","id":"theguardian/2012/sep/18/guardian-weekly-notes-queries-21-september","fields":{"body":"<h2><strong>If God is good and all-powerful, why didn't he/she make everyone always happy?</strong></h2><p>God is an able psychologist among his/her attributes and knows that to experience happiness one has to know misery and pain.

The cancellation notice stated that the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/\" title=\"\">state department</a> \"intends to conduct additional market research and re-examine its requirements for this programme\".</p><p>The U-turn was an embarrassment for the state department, which spends close to $40m a year on spreading English language skills around the world. But it is also a tacit acknowledgement that e-readers may not be a quick fix for raising learning achievement and that more needs to be done to learn how to exploit them effectively.</p><p>The reasons behind the withdrawal remain unclear. One factor may have been the US's <a href=\"http://www.nfb.org/\" title=\"\">National Federation of the Blind</a>'s (NFB) claim that Kindles are not fully accessible to the visually impaired and therefore the <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/97451466/Mauer2clinton-Nfb\" title=\"\">project was illegal</a>. \"This agreement would violate US law regarding access to information by the blind,\" NFB president Marc Maurer said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the apparent commitment to conduct further research  has been welcomed by many education experts. Mobile learning has a relatively short history, but there is much to learn from both the successes and failures of early projects.</p><p>The agreement with Amazon would have involved a purchase of 35,000 Kindles over five years, with pre-loaded content and access to further material online. The anticipated value of the contract was $16.5m with the state department aiming to: \"Create a global e-reader programme that introduces aspects of US society and culture directly to young people, students, and international audiences in new ways and expands English language learning opportunities worldwide.\"</p><p>While Amazon's input into the project was clearly outlined in <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=8232e06b4c4af4bb54f90e706b5e9ebc&amp;tab=core&amp;tabmode=list&amp;=\" title=\"\">US Federal Business Opportunities</a> documentation, there appeared to have been little focus on exactly how the Kindles would be integrated into current education programmes. Yet a concentration on technology over pedagogy has become a critical factor in determining the success of English language programmes that combine ICT and traditional teaching, also known as blended learning.</p><p>Kindles have already been used to support large-scale education projects. The nonprofit organisation <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/\" title=\"\">Worldreader</a> aims to improve literacy and language skills of school children in developing countries by providing digital libraries on Kindle devices. With current projects in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda, encouraging results have been reported in evaluation studies. Worldreader is also developing its <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/what-we-do/our-app/\" title=\"\">Book App</a> that can be accessed on mobile phones, with further details on new funding partners for this scheme expected to be announced shortly.</p><p>However, putting in funding and providing hardware for a blended learning project is not enough by itself. The US-based <a href=\"http://one.laptop.org/\" title=\"\">One Laptop Per Child</a> (OLPC) project has distributed more than 2m low-cost laptops since 2007 to children globally, but a report by the <a href=\"http://www.iadb.org/en/research-and-data/publication-details,3169.html?pub_id=IDB-WP-304\" title=\"\">Inter-American Development Bank</a> into OLPC in Peru sparked widespread debate when it appeared in February. It stated that, 15 months after implementation, there appeared to be no significant increase in language test score levels or the quality of teaching in classrooms. The report suggested that the amount of training that teachers received on how to use the technology with their students could have been a factor in the disappointing results.</p><p>When large numbers of expensive and delicate electronic devices are involved, research and training on how to maintain them is key. Over 40% of the Kindles broke during Worldreader's initial pilot in Ghana. According to <a href=\"http://worldreader.org/uploads/Worldreader%20ILC%20USAID%20iREAD%20Final%20Report%20Jan-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">USAid's final evaluation report</a>: \"[the] high breakage rates were primarily a result of the device's fragile screen and vulnerability to&nbsp;dust.\"  Worldreader claims that the breakage rates have been reduced to almost zero in the latest project, following the introduction of a more robust screen and better training for users on care and maintenance.</p><p>Working on ways to ensure that the technology is valued by the students, teachers and administrators is also of crucial importance in ensuring that the devices do not end up being discarded.</p><p>As UK-based ELT learning technologies specialist <a href=\"http://www.psa.eu.com/\" title=\"\">Pete Sharma</a> states: \"Both teachers and students need to hold positive attitudes towards technology. While many teachers are happy to incorporate digital learning, others are less so. If the teacher does not believe in the pedagogical soundness of the digital component, there is a real chance of failure.\"</p><p>The content that is available for use via the devices must also be closely matched to the existing curriculum.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/english\" title=\"\">British Council</a>'s English projects manager David Pardoe has been working on bringing English language audio content to resource-poor schools in sub-Saharan Africa. British Council-produced podcasts and radio programmes are loaded onto solar-powered, portable devices with integrated speakers, known as <a href=\"http://lifelineenergy.org/lifeplayer.html\" title=\"\">Lifeplayers</a>. These are being distributed to rural schools in eight countries in southern Africa.</p><p>\"A lot of people get excited when they see the device and that is good, but the initial enthusiasm can quickly be lost if it's not linked to curriculum,\" Pardoe says. \"I would say that right now, matching content is almost more important than the device, because if it's not then it's quite difficult to convince a teacher to use it in lessons.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/\" title=\"\">Unesco</a> is currently drafting policy guidelines for the development of m‑learning initiatives. According to its programme specialist Steve Vosloo, \"[Our] research has found that there is a dearth of policy related to mobile learning at the national level. [The guidelines will] try to fill that vacuum by helping policy makers understand the benefits and challenges related to mobile learning and to offer guidelines for creating an enabling policy environment in which mobile learning can grow.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/18/ereader-education-challenge","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2012/sep/18/ereader-education-challenge","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"University Awards: judges","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-11T13:27:00Z","sectionId":"higher-education-network","id":"higher-education-network/2012/sep/11/university-awards-judges","fields":{"body":"<h2>Professor Janet Beer, chair, <strong>University Alliance</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-401212386'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/3/1346680805291/Janet-Beer-005.jpg' alt='GUA speakers: Janet Beer' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Professor Janet Beer took up her role as vice-chancellor of Oxford Brookes University in 2007.

The 66-year-old Big Issue founder tells yet another anecdote then bursts into Fings Ain't What They Used T'Be.</p><p>So much has changed since Bird launched the Big Issue 21 years ago tomorrow. So much and so little.</p><p>In 1991, Britain was in the grip of a homelessness crisis when the magazine asked on its debut front cover, \"Why Don't The Homeless All Go Home?\". Fast-forward to 2012, and Britain has recorded the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/mar/08/homelessness-jumps-repossession-unemployment\" title=\"\">biggest rise in nine years of people officially classed as homeless</a>, and the number of rough sleepers in England has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/23/number-rough-sleepers-rises-fifth\" title=\"\">grown by a fifth since autumn 2010</a>, to 2,181 people.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Big Issue has had to weather its own storms, largely due to changes in the media. The internet has hammered print advertising and a wave of free titles have moved on to British streets. The weekly Big Issue now faces competition from rival free papers and magazines including Metro, the London Evening Standard, ShortList, Stylist – and soon Time Out.</p><p>\"It is hard times. It's hard for me and hard for the vendors because people are looking for leadership,\" Bird says. Average weekly sales of the Big Issue have plummeted 66% since 2002, to 105,743 in the year to December 2011. The magazine sells nearly 150,000 fewer copies a week than during its heyday in 2001, but still boasts a bigger circulation than big names including Nuts, Vanity Fair and Four Four Two.</p><p>Bird says the fall is down to two factors: Tony Blair, who helped reduce the number of homeless people at the turn of the millennium; and the 9/11 and 7/7 terror attacks, which, he says, have made Britons far more guarded in public and less likely to buy his magazine from a street vendor.</p><p>Like many of its rivals, the Big Issue has responded by tightening its belt. Editorial budgets have been pared back and its cover price has risen.</p><p>In 2002, Bird faced a mini revolt as several senior staff, including the then editor, Matthew Collin, took voluntary redundancy in protest at cuts to staffing.</p><p>The magazine now sells for £2.50, with the vendor keeping £1.25 from each sale.</p><p>\"We're morphing like everyone else, but we're morphing a bit slower,\" Bird admits. Editorially, the title needs to be \"more leaderly\" and \"more chatty\", he says. \"We're not standing still but I don't think there are any easy business answers.\"</p><p>Bird, an ex-rough sleeper and ex-offender, speaks from vivid experience when he says the Big Issue must always be financially self-reliant, even in these straitened times. He is proudest when pointing out that it has never taken a penny of government money or outside investment. He says it would be \"highly profitable\" if it did not run a national network of distribution offices, staffed by outreach workers who help motivate and recruit 2,900 vendors.</p><p>The Big Issue business still makes money. It reported a pre-tax profit of £374,000 in the year to March 2011 on a £6.5m turnover, according to the latest financial results available at Companies House. Bird reckons the year to March 2012 will bring a £350,000 profit – a return that pleases him, but not the accountants.</p><p>He says, cheerfully: \"Some accountant came and looked at the business and said, 'Fucking crap business. There's no way of making money, not unless you double the price of the paper. Fucking crap business but it's a great charity'.\"</p><p>Bird has not lost any of his brutish charm down the years. He talks intensely and at length about the plight of the poor, and his various run-ins with politicians, homeless groups and the unions. Now 66, he lives six miles outside Cambridge with his third wife and their two young children.</p><p>Arriving for the interview, he rides along the city's elegant Kings Parade on a tatty black bike with a punctured tyre; we sit at an outside table of a cafe near King's College, where he swigs from an unfinished bottle of water left by a previous customer.</p><p>The self-styled \"middle-class geezer\" is not short of ideas on how to grow the Big Issue franchise. He has inspired the launch of several spin-off titles around the world, with Big Issues now available in Namibia, Kenya and Malawi. Recently, he started a venture capital arm and a new digital publication is being developed, known as <a href=\"http://www.answersfrombigissue.com/\" title=\"\">Answers From Big Issue</a>, where vendors will act as roving correspondents.</p><p>Other planned ventures are straight out of an Alan Partridge sketch. \"Bag Issue\" is a canvas bag-cum-paper allowing the owner to carry their things and read articles in printed lettering on the outside. The name was inspired by a trip north of the border, where a vendor was heard shouting \"Bag Issue!\" in a thick Glaswegian accent. Another idea, he says, is \"Bog Issue\". No prizes for guessing where that would be read.</p><p>\"We launched Big Issue as a way of decriminalising the poor, especially the homeless, so if they had a [drug] habit they didn't have to rob anybody to feed their habit,\" he says. \"We're not sitting back writing books about how bad capitalism is. We're saying 'let's make a better job of the pig's ear that is capitalism'.\"</p><p>In conversation, Bird meanders from one unfinished argument to the next and reels off a series of bawdy anecdotes. The self-described \"ex-Marxist, Leninist, Trotskyist\" avoids direct criticism of David Cameron's coalition government, the royal family or the Labour party, but reserves his ire for the current breed of self-ambitious politicians.</p><p>\"Why is it that whenever you meet a politician you wonder what they were like in the playground? They're all failures. I've never met any one of them that's impressive,\" he says. But he adds that he likes Ed Miliband and one of his favourite MPs was the late Mo Mowlam. \"I'm sure, back in the old days, Churchill was a very impressive guy, but I bet it's '  cos he couldn't get his leg over. They're kind of masturbatory people, aren't they? It's unfortunate, you meet them and think they're empty.\"</p><p>Although Bird is every inch the chippy provocateur he was in 1991 – when co-founder Gordon Roddick (husband of the late Anita) and the Body Shop asked him to help launch an ambitious street paper for the homeless – large chunks of his time are now spent flying around the world giving talks about poverty and other topics. He recently spoke at <a href=\"http://www.tedxoxbridge.com/speakers/\" title=\"\">TEDx Oxbridge</a>, then delivered a speech in Germany and will soon fly to China to discuss the impact of modern technology.</p><p>\"After 21 years you would have thought someone would have offered me £30,000 or £40,000 to sit on a board every now and then,\" he says, only half joking. \"If I was in politics or business I'd have another £100,000 a year by now.\"</p><p>But what next for the Big Issue? Bird wants to turn its sellers, who brave fair weather and foul to pocket £1.25 from each copy, into modern-day town criers. Some of the 2,900 vendors have sold the magazine since September 1991, others have only recently found themselves needing to rebuild their lives. The weekly, meanwhile, returns to the streets on its 21st birthday with the same \"a hand up, not a handout\" mantra it carried on its very first front page.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/7/1347032693719/John-Bird-interview-Big-I-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/09/interview-john-bird-big-issue-at-21","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/2012/sep/09/interview-john-bird-big-issue-at-21","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"Shooting for glory at the Olympics","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-04T12:59:01Z","sectionId":"theguardian","id":"theguardian/2012/sep/04/weekly-notes-queries-olympic-shooting","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Where is the sport in Olympic shooting events?</strong></p><p>It is just a change in technology.

Now figures are about 5% but, for us to deal with youth unemployment, we need to grow by 10%. It takes everyone's commitment.

He's been a politician for 27 years, vice-president for five years, and has served in ministerial positions – including foreign affairs minister – under Kenya's former president, Daniel arop Moi, and the incumbent Mwai Kibaki. After two terms in office, Kibaki is not eligible to stand for a third. \"We are prepared, mentally, to succeed,\" Musyoka said.</p><p></p><p>Kenya will be anxious to avoid the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/dec/31/kenya.haroonsiddique\" title=\"\">violence that marred the 2007 elections</a>, when Kibaki declared himself winner amid accusations of vote rigging and intimidation. Hundreds of people died or were injured in clashes. The government is pushing hard for the <a href=\"http://www.iebc.or.ke/\" title=\"\">Independent Electoral Boundary Commission</a> to implement a biometric voter registration system to avoid ghost voters, although <a href=\"http://www.biometricupdate.com/201207/problems-plague-kenyan-electoral-biometrics-contract/\" title=\"\">questions have been raised about the tendering process</a> being used to acquire registration kits, and plans appear to have been put on hold.</p><p></p><p>Musyoka believes the <a href=\"http://www.kenyaembassy.com/pdfs/The%20Constitution%20of%20Kenya.pdf\" title=\"\">country's new constitution</a> (pdf), enacted in 2010, will ease any tensions. The constitution, which he describes as the best in the world, was hard won, emerging only after 20 years of failed attempts. When he came to power in 2002, President Kibaki promised a new constitution within 90 days. Three years later, in 2005, a referendum rejected draft proposals. Musyoka voted no, resulting in a split with Kibaki. It was the election violence in 2007 that made constitutional reform more urgent.</p><p></p><p>As well as outlining people's economic and social rights, such as those related to healthcare, education and land, and calling for more women and people from marginalised groups to be included in all tiers of government, the constitution urged major reform of the executive and legislative, devolving some power away from the president to 47 local counties. Alongside a focus on calming ethnic tensions, the constitution aimed to reduce corruption, which is endemic in Kenyan politics and which, Musyoka believes, has dragged the country down economically.</p><p></p><p>Musyoka is optimistic that the constitution will make a difference. \"The ball game has changed,\" he said. \"It can never be business as usual when it comes to corrupt practices.\"</p><p></p><p>One possible test of whether the game really has changed will be how the country manages its new oil wealth. Musyoka said he is anxious to avoid the so-called \"resource curse\" that has beset many other African states. \"It is very clear in my mind we cannot allow recent oil discoveries to be a curse,\" he said, adding that he recently had discussions with Ghana's new president about the possibility of comparing notes on the management of their respective oil deals. \"There is a need for both countries to have a hard look at them [deals] so the benefits can be seen by the majority of the population. People must own what is in their country.\"</p><p></p><p>With a new constitution and the oil discovery, Musyoka is optimistic about Kenya's future. \"I think Kenya is going to be a very exciting country going forward,\" he said.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/8/31/1346428504666/MDG--Republic-of-Kenya-Vi-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/03/kalonzo-musyoka-technology-city-kenya","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/sep/03/kalonzo-musyoka-technology-city-kenya","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"London 2012 Paralympic athletes: the full list of competitors and disciplines","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-30T16:51:00Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"news/datablog/2012/aug/30/every-paralympic-athlete-and-their-sport-data","fields":{"body":"<p>More than 4,000 athletes from 164 teams will compete over the next ten days at the 2012 Paralympics.

On the same website, Matere found that the cure for his potato disease was to sprinkle wood ash on the crop. Two months later, his potatoes were back to shape and Matere knew it was time to invest in the internet. Online, he found a local buyer for his rescued crop. He now uses an internet-enabled phone to get real-time potato prices. All this happened in a region that only five years ago <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/9660077\" title=\"\">the <em>Economist</em> referred to as the \"dark continent</a>\" because of its lack of electricity.</p><p>Technology started to influence the way Africa develops in a big way with the introduction of GSM services in the late 1990s. A mobile revolution has positioned Africa as the fastest growing region on Earth for the telecoms industry, and with it has come a significant shift – a recognition among African governments and people that an opportunity exists to leap the development gap through the implementation of technological solutions to some of the challenges facing the continent.</p><p>For many people in the rest of the world, life without the internet is hard to imagine. In Nigeria, many still remember queuing to use the Nitel (the country's national operator) phone in the village. In 2001, a sim card cost approximately $100 and local calls cost 33 cents per minute. By 2009, you could buy a sim card for $1.33 (a 98.6% reduction) and calls had reduced to 24 cents per minute. Billions of dollars of investment flooded in and, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ncc.gov.ng/\" title=\"\">Nigerian Communications Commission</a> (NCC), active subscriber numbers in Nigeria exceeded 100m lines earlier this year.</p><p>This explosion in mobile telephony preceded, and in many ways caused, an explosion in the number of Nigerians using the internet as a tool to communicate and to do business. The GSMA (Groupe Spéciale Mobile Association) has estimated that, in 2009, more than 31 million Nigerians accessed the web, with 30% or more doing so via mobile phones. From free instant messaging services that removed the relatively high cost of sending an SMS to the development of local applications to solve local problems, the internet and its access platforms are at the heart of emerging&nbsp;businesses.</p><p>New technology has the power to influence economic development as well as political accountability in numerous ways. As the experience of Zack Matere demonstrates, simple access to information can be fundamental to development. Likewise, in Ethiopia, the launch of a revolutionary new commodities exchange in 2008 was designed to provide real-time information to the country's smallholder farmers, who constitute 80% of the population and who were generally only aware of the price of their commodities at local markets. An&nbsp;automated toll-free telephone service now provides updated prices by the minute.</p><p>Businesses are also beginning to tap into the desire of millions of its consumers to access entertainment online. One of the best examples is in Nigeria, where the stunning success of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/realnollymovies\" title=\"\">Real Nolly Movies</a> provides&nbsp;a&nbsp;benchmark for budding technology entrepreneurs across the&nbsp;continent.</p><p>Launched as a YouTube channel in March, Real Nolly has the digital distribution rights to hundreds of Nigeria's hugely popular Nollywood films, making them available to viewers&nbsp;free of charge. Already the channel is receiving millions of views&nbsp;and generating considerable monthly advertising revenues while helping to promote legal distribution of Nigerian content.</p><p>Technology is contributing, too, to Africa's growing presence on the global&nbsp;stage. The Egyptian uprising succeeded in part because the web allowed people to organise inside the country and attract support from outside. The recent deaths of prominent African leaders, such as Malawi head of state Bingu wa Mutharika, Ghanaian president John Atta Mills and, most recently, Ethiopian&nbsp;prime minister Meles Zenawi, made headlines worldwide, and Twitter played a major role in disseminating information about them globally. If technology can help Africa&nbsp;gain a greater share of global news coverage and improve awareness&nbsp;of what is happening on the&nbsp;continent, interest and development will follow.</p><p>But we are only standing on the bottom rung of the ladder in terms of the potential new technology offers. Despite a flurry of activity in the development of infrastructure to improve internet connectivity across the continent, bandwidth remains relatively low and distribution is a problem, especially in Nigeria. If we take Real Nolly Movies, for example, a&nbsp;large part of its audience is in the west (among the Nigerian diaspora), where bandwidth is quicker and cheaper. Imagine its potential for growth as internet access and speed continues to improve.</p><p>George Bernard Shaw once said: \"You see things and you say, 'Why?' But&nbsp;I dream things that never were and&nbsp;I say, 'Why not?'\" This relentless pursuit of the impossible lies at the heart of the internet's success and is what will drive its growth in Africa. The continent has only recently started&nbsp;to harness the power of technology and is already seeing significant dividends. How it exploits the internet over the coming years will&nbsp;be one of the defining contributions to its long-term&nbsp;development.</p><p><em>Juliet Ehimuan is Google Nigeria country manager</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345744196669/Discover-column-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/26/new-technology-farming-films-africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/aug/26/new-technology-farming-films-africa","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Africa innovations: 15 ideas helping to transform a continent","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-25T23:05:00Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2012/aug/26/africa-innovations-transform-continent","fields":{"body":"<h2><strong>1 HIPPO WATER ROLLER</strong></h2><p><strong>Idea: </strong>The <a href=\"http://hipporoller.org/\" title=\"\">Hippo water roller</a> is a&nbsp;drum that can be rolled on the ground, making it easier for those without access to taps to haul larger amounts of water faster.</p><p><strong>Problem: </strong>Two out of every five people in Africa have no nearby water facilities and are forced to walk long distances to reach water sources. Traditional methods of balancing heavy loads of water on the head limit the amount people can carry, and cause long-term spinal injuries. Women and children usually carry out these time-consuming tasks, missing out on educational and economic opportunities. In extreme cases, they can be at increased risks of assault or rape when travelling long distances.</p><p><strong>Method: </strong>The Hippo roller can be filled with water which is then pushed or pulled using a handle. The weight of the water is spread evenly so a full drum carries almost five times more than traditional containers, but weighs in at half the usual 20kg, allowing it to be transported faster. A steel handle has been designed to allow two&nbsp;pushers for steeper hills. \"Essentially it alleviates the suffering people endure just to collect water and take it home. Boreholes or wells can dry out but people can still use the same roller [in other wells]. One roller will typically serve a household of seven for five to seven years,\" said project manager Grant Gibbs.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Around 42,000 Hippo rollers have been sold in 21 African countries and demand exceeds supply. Costing $125 each, they are distributed through NGOs. A mobile manufacturing unit is set to begin making them in Tanzania. Nelson Mandela has made a \"personal appeal\" for supporting for the project, saying it \"will positively change the lives of millions of our fellow South&nbsp;Africans\". <strong>Monica Mark</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><h2><strong>2 THE iCOW APP </strong></h2><p><strong>Idea: </strong>To harness the power of mobile phones to encourage best practice for dairy farmers and increase milk production.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Small-scale dairy farmers often living in remote areas don't have access to valuable information about latest prices of milk or cattle, and they may not keep accurate records of important details such as their cows' gestation periods or their livestock's lineage – often resulting in inbreeding and disease.</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> Created by Kenyan farmer <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wD8pzIcCJk\" title=\"\">Su&nbsp;Kahumbu</a>, <a href=\"http://www.icow.co.ke/\" title=\"\">iCow</a> is an app that works on the type of basic mobile phones farmers own. Each animal is registered with the service, which then sends SMS reminders to the farmer about milking schedules, immunisation dates and tips about nutrition and breeding or information about local vets or artificial insemination providers. UK-based foundation the <a href=\"http://indigotrust.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Indigo Trust</a> helped fund iCow's development. Its executive Loren Treisman says: \"It's exciting to see a technology-driven project targeting such an unexpected constituency. Farmers have been empowered to improve their own lives through accessing critical agricultural information as opposed to depending on aid. What particularly excited us is that as a social enterprise, the iCow team have a sustainable business model which will enable them to expand rapidly and maximise their reach and impact without dependence on ongoing&nbsp;funding.\"</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> \"The wonderful thing with iCow is that by the time you have used the app and adhered to all the instructions, your cows end up healthier, bigger and stronger. They can easily fetch you more money in the marketplace. Every smart farmer will use iCow,\" a small-scale  farmer based in the cental highlands of Kenya told <em>Forbes </em>magazine. <strong>Ian Tucker</strong></p><h2><strong>3 FARMER MANAGED NATURAL REGENERATION </strong></h2><p><strong>Idea:</strong> Farmer managed natural regeneration (FMNR), which restores existing trees on drought-stricken land, to improve Senegal's dwindling harvests.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Senegal is suffering its third drought of the decade, resulting in reduced crops and inflated food prices. The World Food Programme assisted more than 9 million people in the Sahel region of West Africa this year, including 800,000 in Senegal.</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> Attempts to tackle the resulting problem of soil fertility have largely flopped so far. Trees planted as part of reforestation schemes have seen only a 5% success rate and fallowing is not an option, with 80% of African farmers owning under two hectares of land, which need to be utilised year in, year out. This puts the emphasis on reinvigorating the stumps of nitrogen-fixing  trees, which were formerly cleared to maximise crop space. Farmers are thus encouraged to prune the stems and branches of trees like <em>Faidherbia albida</em>, giving new life to the vegetation already there.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> FMNR is an inexpensive way for farmers to make improvements with the resources they already have, increasing millet harvests from 430kg to 750kg a hectare, and saving money on fertilisers, with restored trees producing leaf litter (forming humus) and giving shade to livestock (for manure). It gives the ecosystem a holistic boost, encouraging wildlife like bush pigeons and rabbits to return, and providing welcome human benefits such as wood cuttings&nbsp;for cooking and new food sources such as tamarind. <strong>Mina Holland</strong></p><h2><strong>4 PORTABLE WATER PUMPS </strong></h2><p><strong>Idea:</strong> Portable irrigation technology  helping sub-Saharan smallholder farmers grow crops out of season.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> When it comes to food supply, Africa faces enormous instability due to unpredictable climate and poor resources. Only 6% of Africa's cultivated land is irrigated, limiting the volume of crops that can be grown out of season, but increased access to irrigation systems stands to increase food productivity by up to&nbsp;50%.</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.kickstart.org/\" title=\"\">Kick Start</a>, a not-for-profit organisation that specialises in irrigation technology, is making portable water pumps accessible to farming communities across Africa – most significantly in Kenya, Tanzania and Mali. These cost anything from $35 to $95 but, putting the emphasis on entrepreneurship, Kick Start are selling the pumps to farmers rather than giving them away.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Kick Start told <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Atlantic</em> </a>that, since 1991, their pumps have lifted 667,000 people out of poverty, helping to \"create an entrepreneurial middle class, starting with the family farm\". They have pumped new revenues equivalent to 0.6% of the GDP in Kenya&nbsp;alone. <strong>MH</strong></p><h2><strong>5 THE CARDIOPAD </strong></h2><p><strong>Idea: </strong>A computer tablet diagnoses heart disease in rural households with limited access to medical services.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Cardiovascular diseases kill some 17 million worldwide annually. In many African countries, those at risk often have to spend huge amounts of money and travel hundreds of miles to reach heart specialists concentrated in main urban centres. The Cameroon Heart Foundation has noted a \"sharp spike\" in heart disease among its 20 million-strong population, which is served by fewer than 40 heart&nbsp;specialists.</p><p><strong>Method: </strong>A program on the Cardiopad, designed by 24-year-old Cameroonian engineer Arthur Zang, collects signals generated by the rhythmic contraction&nbsp;and expansion of a patient's heart. Electrodes are fixed near the patient's heart. Africa's first fully touch-screen medical tablet then produces a moving graphical depiction of the cardiac cycle, which is wirelessly&nbsp;transmitted over GSM networks to a cardiologist for interpretation and diagnosis. \"I&nbsp;designed the Cardiopad to resolve a&nbsp;pressing problem. If a cardiac exam is prescribed for a patient in Garoua in the north of the country, they are&nbsp;obliged to travel&nbsp;a distance&nbsp;of over 900km to Yaoundé or Douala,\" Zang says.</p><p><strong>Verdict: </strong>At the Laquintinie, one of the country's biggest hospitals, cardiologist Dr Daniel Lemogoum said that, in a recent survey, three in every five persons who uses&nbsp;the Cardiopad has been&nbsp;diagnosed as hypertensive, or at risk of heart diseases. \"These are people who&nbsp;would not necessarily have been aware they are hypertensive. It means sudden&nbsp;deaths might be&nbsp;preventable.\" <strong>MM</strong></p><h2><strong>6 NIGERIAN  COMPUTER TABLET</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p> <strong>Idea: </strong><a href=\"http://enciphergroup.com/products/pre-order-inye-tablet/\" title=\"\">The Inye computer tablet</a> that can connect to the internet via a dongle surmounts the price and infrastructure barriers in one go.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Tech-savvy youths, who make up the bulk of the continent's population, face being left behind by a growing \"digital divide\". While much of Africa has skipped the desktop internet era and gone straight to mobile tech, big name brands retail in price ranges that remain out of reach for a majority in sub-Saharan Africa. Infrastructure is also straining under rapid population growth, and wireless and broadband technology is not yet widely available in many public places.</p><p><strong>Method: </strong>Co-founders Saheed Adepoju and Anibe Agamah, aimed to plug a gap in affordable mobile devices with the Inye tablet in Nigeria. They say its strongest selling point is its price – currently around £200. Run on Android systems, it can be connected to the internet via widely used dongles rather than wirelessly. IT provider <a href=\"http://enciphergroup.com/\" title=\"\">Encipher</a> also offers add-on bundles from games to specifically tailored apps. Local developers are designing apps that address issues such as HIV, water and sanitation and education.</p><p><strong>Verdict: </strong>The group is now retailing its <a href=\"http://enciphergroup.com/products/inye2/\" title=\"\">Inye 2 model</a> to popular demand. Long-term, there are plans to expand beyond Africa's most populous country. <strong>MM</strong></p><h2><strong>7 ETHANOL COOKING  OIL PLANT</strong></h2><p><strong>Idea: </strong>Refining locally sourced cassava into ethanol fuel to provide cleaner cooking fuel.</p><p><strong>Problem: </strong>Forests in Africa are being cut down at a rate of 4m hectares a year, more than twice the worldwide average rate. Some of this is fuelled by demand for wood and charcoal, which the UN estimates is still used in almost 80% of African homes as a cheaper option to gas. The smoke from cooking using these solid fuels also triggers respiratory problems that cause nearly 2 million deaths in the developing world each year.</p><p><strong>Method: </strong><a href=\"http://www.cleanstarmozambique.com/\" title=\"\">CleanStar Mozambique</a>, a partnership between CleanStar and Danish industrial enzymes producer <a href=\"http://www.novozymes.com/en/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Novozymes</a>, has opened the world's first sustainable cooking-fuel plant in Mozambique. CleanStar has steered clear of monoculture crops in favour of sustainable farming methods. One-sixth of the final yield comes from locally harvested cassava, which requires farmers to plant in rotation with other edible crops to keep the soil fertile. A Sofala Province-based plant transforms the products into ethanol, which is sold on the local market along with adapted cooking stoves also produced by the company.</p><p><strong>Verdict: </strong>\"City women are tired of watching charcoal prices rise, carrying dirty fuel, and waiting for the day that they can afford a safe gas stove and a reliable supply of imported cylinders,\" CleanStar marketing director Thelma Venichand said. \"They are ready to buy a modern cooking device that uses clean, locally made fuel, performs well and saves them time and money.\" The plant aims to produce 2m litres of fuel annually, and reach 120,000 households within three years. <strong>MM</strong></p><h2><strong>8 REFUGEES UNITED</strong></h2><p><strong>Idea: </strong>Danish brothers David and Christopher Mikkelsen founded <a href=\"http://www.refunite.org/\" title=\"\">Refugees United</a> in 2008 after they helped a young Afghan refugee in Copenhagen search for lost family members. Realising the futile paper trail that many refugees were faced with when looking for missing relatives, the brothers wanted to find an easier way that refugees could trace their families.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> There are 43 million forcibly displaced people worldwide with hundreds of thousands of refugee families scattered across the globe. Before 2008 all family tracing was done by refugee agencies, which still rely on paper forms and postal systems to try to locate people. There was no online global data bank that could be accessed or used by refugees themselves.</p><p><strong>Technique: </strong>Refugees United is an online search tool, where refugees can create a free profile and start their search for family via an online database using the internet or a mobile phone. It works through an open-source model, partnering with not-for-profit refugee organisations including the Red Cross and the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)</a> as well as corporate tech partners such as Erickson and Google.</p><p><strong>Verdict: </strong>More than 100,000 people are registered on the Refugees United family tracing platform. It is available in dozens of different languages and contains searchable information on refugees from more than 82 countries. It is currently helping 15,000 people trace family in the Kakuma refugee camp, home to 80,000 refugees and asylum-seekers, in Kenya. The main challenge is actually reaching the refugees, often the poorest of the poor, who don't have ready access to computers or mobile phones. <strong>Annie Kelly</strong></p><h2>9 <strong>DIY AID SUPPLIES</strong></h2><p><strong>Idea:</strong> To make Africa self-sufficient in emergency relief supplies.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> For a continent so in need of quick, affordable emergency relief, not to mention so riddled with unemployment, there's a cruel irony about the provenance of emergency supplies. Smaller African manufacturers have traditionally been unable to compete with Chinese prices, or to meet the vast demand for emergency goods within Africa. As a result, aid agencies such as <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Unicef</a> have forged links with foreign producers better able to produce these supplies at the scale, cost and quality required. Yet this inevitably requires longer lead times and higher transportation costs than sourcing goods locally – and Africans lose out on the work.</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.advanceaid.org/\" title=\"\">Advance Aid</a> is an organisation that wants to make aid destined for Africa available within Africa, from blankets and mosquito nets to basic cooking equipment and hygiene kits. The organisation acts as an intermediary between large aid agencies and African producers, putting together packages of aid supplies sourced locally. This has been very effective in Kenya, where <a href=\"http://www.advanceaid.org/\" title=\"\">Advance Aid</a> have supplied 5,000 locally sourced emergency kits to <a href=\"http://www.worldvision.org.uk/\" title=\"\">World Vision</a> and another 14,000 jerry cans to <a href=\"http://crs.org/africa/\" title=\"\">Catholic Relief Services</a>, who distributed them in Dadaab, the refugee camp near the Somalian border.</p><p>Founder <a href=\"http://www.advanceaid.org/david-dickie/\" title=\"\">David Dickie</a> says: \"Aid is not working. I'm trying to turn the market on its head by creating jobs in Africa. Building this capacity in Africa will make a real difference to agencies, to the beneficiaries of the aid and to local businesses… [It] is a very efficient way of bringing together the development and humanitarian agendas.\"</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Advance Aid's work in Kenya in 2011 marks the first time that emergency relief goods produced in Africa have been provided for an African emergency, with 80% of goods sourced within the country. It put $1.5bn into the Kenyan economy and brought orders to 12 local manufacturers. <strong>MH</strong></p><h2><strong>10 SICKLE CELL  DISEASE RESEARCH</strong></h2><p><strong>Idea:</strong> To carry out scientific research on sickle cell disease (SCD) and show that large-scale, cutting-edge genomic studies are possible in Africa.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Every year, 300,000 children worldwide are born with SCD, a genetic blood disorder that can result in severe anaemia. Seventy percent of these children, or 210,000, are born in Africa. Tanzania has one of the highest annual birth rates of SCD in the world and without treatment up to 90% of these children will die in early childhood. However, many of these deaths could be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. A better understanding of the genetic and environmental mechanisms of the&nbsp;disease will lead to improved diagnosis and therapies.</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/julie-makani\" title=\"\">Dr Julie Makani</a> from Muhimbili University in Tanzania is working with the <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Wellcome Trust</a> to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in order to better understand the genetic and environmental factors affecting SCD. The Muhimbili Wellcome Programme originally aimed to follow 400 children but is now following 2,500, making it one of the largest, biomedical SCD resources in the world. Dr Makani says that the work \"provides validation that it is possible to conduct genomic research in Africa\".</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/people/lorna-casselton/\" title=\"\">Professor Lorna Casselton</a> from the <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/\" title=\"\">Royal Society</a> says: \"SCD has a severe toll on Africa, and high-quality research to lessen the burden is much needed. Dr Makani stands as a role model for other young African scientists wishing to make a difference.\" <strong>Olivia Honigsbaum</strong></p><h2><strong>11 M-PEPEA</strong></h2><p><strong>Idea:</strong> To offer emergency credit through mobile phones to people who don't have access to credit cards or bank loans.</p><p><strong>Problem: </strong>Credit cards are still rarely available to Kenyans and bank loans are only authorised for large amounts of cash or as investments for buying homes or starting businesses. Often the only source of emergency cash is loan sharks, increasingly big business in Kenya, with borrowers signing ambiguous photocopied contracts and tying themselves into interest rates of 50% or more. <a href=\"http://raven.co.ke/mpepea%20services.html\" title=\"\">M-Pepea</a> was launched to try to bridge this gap.</p><p><strong>Method: </strong>M-Pepea, set up in late 2010, provides its customers with emergency funds within a few hours. It partners with Kenyan businesses, with employees then able to use M-Pepea to get immediate loans of up to 20% of their monthly salary. The money is accessed through their mobile phones, with M-Pepea sending a special pin code to be used in cash machines. Money can also be collected at branches of <a href=\"https://www.safaricom.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Safaricom</a>, one of Kenya's largest mobile phone operators, and then deducted from the borrower's pay packet at&nbsp;the end of the month. M-Pepea charges around 10% interest rates on the loans, which are paid in full at the end of the&nbsp;month.</p><p><strong>Verdict: </strong>M-Pepea has currently partnered with 20 businesses and has around 300 subscribers, and is hoping to have increased this to 20,000 by the end of 2013. Its partnership with Safaricom is encouraging but the company has run into problems with businesses defaulting. \"We're still in our initial phase, but we've seen how positively people have responded to the service,\" says David Munga, M-Pepea's 33-year-old founder. \"If, like&nbsp;many Kenyans, you've found yourself at the side of the road with a broken car, no credit card and no money in the bank, it's a way of getting yourself that money without having to get into trouble.\" <strong>AK</strong></p><h2><strong>12 THE TUTU VAN </strong></h2><p><strong>Idea:</strong> The brightly coloured <a href=\"http://www.desmondtutuhivcentre.org.za/page/prevention:%20tutu%20tester%20mobile%20unit/\" title=\"\">\"Tutu Tester\" van</a> is a mobile clinic that incorporates screening for tuberculosis (TB) and HIV into a general health check-up in order to overcome the stigma associated with these diseases.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> South Africa is at the centre of an epidemic of TB/HIV co-infections. An estimated 5.7 million people are infected with HIV and, fuelled by HIV, the country's rate of TB has increased over the last 20 years to the point where it now has the third highest TB burden in the world. In the case of HIV, <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/publications/irc-pub01/jc379-vct_en.pdf\" title=\"\">voluntary counselling and testing (VCT)</a> is vital for preventing and treating the disease. However, data from the <a href=\"http://www.desmondtutuhivcentre.org.za/\" title=\"\">Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation</a> conducted in communities most affected by HIV shows that VCT is often inaccessible or inadequately performed. This results in missed opportunities for prevention and increased morbidity and mortality – hence the need for new control strategies to keep the epidemic in check.</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> The Tutu Tester is a mobile clinic that takes sophisticated testing equipment and trained staff (including a nurse, a counsellor and an educator) into areas without adequate health facilities. By framing TB and HIV screening within a battery of other healthy living tests, including pregnancy, diabetes and hypertension, people are encouraged to get tested for the diseases. Dr Linda-Gail Bekker, a leading scientist working with the foundation, says that data from these screens shows that \"the increase in TB has quite clearly tracked the increase in HIV&nbsp;rates\". Further, the introduction of <a href=\"http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/treatment/en/\" title=\"\">Antiretroviral therapy (ART)</a> for HIV has also led to a decline in the incidence of TB. This suggests that ART programs, if sufficiently implemented, may greatly assist in reducing TB mortality.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> There is still a stigma attached to HIV and TB. But as Liz Thebus, a healthcare worker at the Tutu Tester says: \"The outside world does not know whether someone wants to be screened for HIV or diabetes. They are in that respect much more&nbsp;anonymous.\" <strong>OH</strong></p><h2><strong>13 ORANGE SWEET POTATO</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Idea: </strong>Breeding sweet potatoes to contain betacarotene, to help in the fight against childhood blindness.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> More than 3 million children in Africa suffer from blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency; in Uganda it is estimated that 28% of children are deficient. Currently aid agencies combat this problem by giving children vitamin A supplements, but addressing this issue with a locally grown food would be more sustainable.</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> A new strain of sweet potato was conventionally bred which contains between four and six times as much betacarotene as a regular sweet potato – betacarotene is converted by the body into vitamin A. The <a href=\"http://www.harvestplus.org/content/orange-sweet-potato-makes-case-biofortification-works\" title=\"\">OSP (orange sweet potato)</a> was distributed to 10,000 farming households in Uganda; at the end of the two-year study vitamin A deficiency in non-breastfeeding children aged between 12 and 35 months fell from nearly 50% to 12%. Dr Christine Holz from the <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/\" title=\"\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> who led the project said: \"Overall, these results add to the growing evidence base that OSP provides large amounts of vitamin&nbsp;A in the diet.\"</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Similar results were obtained from a sister project in Mozambique; now the scheme is being scaled up to reach 225,000 households by 2016. <strong>IT</strong></p><h2><strong>14 SPEAKING BOOKS</strong></h2><p><strong>Idea:</strong> A range of easy-to-use audio books designed to get potentially life-saving health messages out to millions of isolated people struggling with depression and mental health problems.</p><p><strong>Problem: </strong>In 2003, Zane Wilson, the founder of the <a href=\"http://www.sadag.org/\" title=\"\">South African Depression &amp; Anxiety Group</a> (Sadag), the country's largest mental health initiative, was horrified at how suicide rates among young South Africans were spiking. Mental health carries a huge social stigma across Africa and information booklets designed to help people with depression or mental health problems simply weren't working, especially in remote communities with high illiteracy rates.&nbsp;People weren't getting the help they needed – a 2009 study showed that only a quarter of the 16.5% of South Africans suffering from&nbsp;mental health problems had received any kind of treatment.</p><p><strong>Method: </strong>Speaking Books created a range of free books with simple audio buttons talking the user through each page. The first Speaking Book, voiced by South African actress and celebrity Lillian Dube, was called <em>Suicide Shouldn't Be a Secret</em> and focused on how depression is a real and treatable illness, encouraging people to get help when they need it.</p><p><strong>Verdict: </strong>Speaking Books have now produced 48 titles in 24 different languages and are now used in 20 African countries across the continent. The books now tackle a number of critical healthcare issues outside of suicide prevention such as HIV and Aids, malaria, maternal health and clinical trials. Speaking Books has also expanded to China, India and South America. \"The situation we face in rural South Africa is the same in any other African country – low literacy compounded by lack of access to services and affordable healthcare,\" says Wilson. \"This means that patients are often not able to get help for many health problems. We believe that this interactive, durable, high-quality, hardcover book engages the user or patient, and allows them to build self-confidence and skills with a simple action plan\". <strong>AK</strong></p><h2><strong>15 NARRATIVE EXPOSURE THERAPY</strong></h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Idea:</strong> Narrative exposure therapy (NET) for Uganda's former child soldiers, encouraging storytelling to help&nbsp;come to terms with their experiences.</p><p><strong>Problem: </strong>Abducted and forced into conscription by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/08/joseph-kony-lords-resistance-army\" title=\"\">Lord's Resistance Army</a> (LRA), over 25,000 Ugandan children were pushed into violent atrocities during a civil war that lasted 22 years, often killing their own families. The majority were left with severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – with symptoms including depression, flashbacks and suicidal thoughts. Moreover, hostility from their former communities has left countless child soldiers alienated, making PTSD a longer, lonelier battle.</p><p><strong>Method: </strong>NET was introduced to Ugandan child soldiers as a means of making conscious their deeply repressed traumas. The technique highlights the importance of story, creating a kind of fiction from real-life experience as a vehicle for coming to terms with it. <a href=\"http://www.nicktaussig.com/about\" title=\"\">Nick Taussig</a>, co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.mtaala.org/Mtaala_Foundation.html\" title=\"\">Mtaala Foundation</a> – a charity that sets up educational communities in Uganda, empowering Ugandans to help their own youth – says that narrative exposure, though not a new concept, appeals to Ugandan culture, \"There's a strong oral tradition in Uganda, and these treatments build on that by committing the children's stories to paper, investing them with added meaning.\"</p><p><strong>Verdict: </strong><a href=\"http://www.preventionaction.org/research/power-storytelling-treating-trauma-child-soldiers/5833\" title=\"\">A study of 85 former child soldiers</a> conducted by Bielefeld University, Germany, demonstrated that 80% of those who underwent NET showed clinical improvements. <strong>MH</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/8/24/1345809856937/Su-Kahumbu-founder-of-iCo-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/26/africa-innovations-transform-continent","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/aug/26/africa-innovations-transform-continent","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"New Africa: the Kenyan internet nerd reshaping a nation","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-25T23:00:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2012/aug/26/new-africa-kenya-activist-internet","fields":{"body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/08/juliana-rotich-100-women\" title=\"\">Juliana Rotich</a> chuckles down the line from Nairobi at the suggestion that she is one of the people helping to shape a new image of Africa. \"Well, I'm a big nerd,\" she says. \"So if a nerd can be part of the future, let's do this.\"</p><p>In 2008, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/28/kenya.international\" title=\"\">political and ethnic violence broke out in Kenya after disputed elections</a>, Rotich was trapped at home in the western city of Eldoret, where <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/03/kenya.topstories3\" title=\"\">some of the worst fighting</a> was taking place.</p><p>A blackout on live news broadcasts had left Kenyans unable to get basic information about what was going on. So Rotich and a group of friends created a website, called <a href=\"http://ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi (\"testimony\" in Swahili)</a>, that used updates from ordinary people, via emails and text messages, and plotted these on an interactive map.</p><p>\"We did something which was pretty natural for us but it was very cathartic,\" Juliana explains. \"It was important to share what I knew.\"</p><p>Within days, Ushahidi was providing information about the spread of fighting to thousands of Kenyans across the country. And throughout the conflict and its aftermath, it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2011/apr/07/ushahidi-crowdmap-kenya-violence-hague\" title=\"\">helped to document the scale of the violence</a>, despite the attempts of politicians to play it down. Since then, the Ushahidi model has been adapted for humanitarian crises worldwide – it was credited  with locating survivors under the rubble<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jan/29/haiti-crowdsourcing\" title=\"\">following the Haiti earthquake</a> – and also found a variety of other, less dramatic uses – a recent application mapped small UK businesses keen to promote themselves during the Olympics.</p><p>The 35-year-old Rotich bubbles with excitement when talking about its global reach: \"The platform has been translated into 20 languages. Can you imagine?' But she's cautious of the kind of breathless post-Arab-spring rhetoric about the power of information-sharing technology to bring sweeping political change. For Rotich its primary role, at least in Africa, is a more prosaic one: helping people get better and cheaper access to basic goods and services rather than inspiring revolution. \"Democracy is an alluring idea,\" she says. \"And we do hope that our technology plays a role but I want to keep that in the context of some of the challenges that are on the ground and the opportunities for technology to help with some of the inefficiencies.\"</p><p>She's proud of the way Ushahidi gave a voice to ordinary Kenyans to explain what was happening in their own communities. \"Africans tell their story better and represent the reality that they live better. When you have a view on a situation from on the ground, it can complicate the narrative in an important way. It wasn't easy for the rest of the world just to say, oh that's another genocide happening'.\"</p><p>As a regular speaker at global technology events, she is all too conscious of how Africa is perceived by the outside world. \"I usually dive straight into the technology and people are shocked, because they are thinking, 'She's an African woman, I expected her to talk about how things are terrible or tell a sad story.'</p><p>\"But in my world, the reality is very exciting.

What the team has done now is combine them all into one index. </p><p>Says Anagnostopoulos:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The more objective view which we propose here attempts to explain as well as possible the number of medals won per country on the basis of its population and GDP per capita. We employ GDP per capita rather than GDP, since we are already taking population into account in this approach. </p></blockquote><p>Each country is then scored based on the number of extra medals it would win if those medals were weighted according to our new ranking - this is known as a residual in statistical jargon). </p><p>\"We propose this as a purer measure of athletic skill. For countries that underperformed, this number can be negative,\" says Anagnostopoulos.</p><p>So, the final ranking is:</p><p><strong>1. Russia      <br />2. UK          <br />3. China       <br />4. Hungary     <br />5. South Korea <br />6. Ukraine     <br />7. Australia  <br />8. Cuba        <br />9. Jamaica     <br />10.

So Team GB has moved way up the table.</p><p>As we know, the UK is ahead of Russia on golds, but it did better on other medals. If this statistical model only measured gold medals, Team GB would come top.</p><p>And Anagnostopoulos poses some words of warning for UK celebrants:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Although the UK has every right to be proud of its performance, this enthusiasm must be somewhat moderated against the fact that past Olympics have shown a clear presence of a home advantage effect.</p></blockquote><p>In 2008, the home team came top. In 2004, Greece ranked 12th according to this model. \"A far superior performance to both before and after it hosted the Olympics.\"</p><p>Which was the best indicator? Says Anagnostopoulos: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The team size indeed proved to be a fairly good predictor of performance in the Games. However, we do not allow this factor to affect a country's ranking here, since in principle a poor, small country can still produce a relatively large team size, and should not be penalized for that. </p></blockquote><p>The full data is published below.

He's also ahead India, Taiwan, Portugal, Nigeria and Thailand. In terms of golds, he's ahead of North Korea.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>He has more than the previous top scorer, gymnast <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larisa_Latynina\">Larisa Latynina</a>, who competed for the USSR and won 18 medals including nine golds. </p><p>He now has 18 gold medals, two silvers and two bronze.

While immense progress has been made on other fronts in the past decade – with millions more children in school and rates of child mortality falling rapidly – progress on malnutrition remains stubbornly slow.</p><p>The reasons for this are complex: although it is the underlying cause of more than 2m child deaths annually, it does not appear on death certificates, so it remains a hidden killer. Similarly, unless there is a strong national plan across government, the responsibility for tackling the problem often falls between departments – agriculture, social services, health – meaning co-ordinated, effective action is difficult, and all too often non-existent. It also mostly affects children – those least able to speak up for themselves.</p><p>With the hunger summit, the prime minister continued his record of global leadership, using the Olympic spotlight to inject fresh impetus into the issue. He brought together leaders from the developing world – including the next Olympic host, Brazil – and from the private sector and international development, to chart a new course of action.</p><p>It felt like a dynamic gathering, and we hope it will be the start of something much bigger. Among the measures announced was investment in research for new drought-resistant and vitamin-enriched crops as well as a major private-sector alliance involving GlaxoSmithKline and Unilever, to make nutritious food available to the poorest families; and support for pioneering programmes such as the one that Save the Children is planning in Kenya, using mobile telephone technology to track hunger hot spots and allocate resources accordingly.</p><p>But if the commitment to help cut the number of children affected by stunted growth by 25 million is to be reached by the Brazilian Olympics in 2016, this must be just the beginning. In 2013 the UK will assume the G8 presidency, and we can use our global leadership to dramatically reduce the numbers dying from malnutrition. We must lead efforts to fix our broken food system. With the right collective effort, it's not too far-fetched to imagine that we could make the current generation the last to experience severe malnutrition.</p><p>To do so, the plan for 2013 must be set out early. We will need to push for commitments from the highest levels of government, including from those countries that carry the highest burden of malnutrition, such as India, Pakistan and Nigeria. We need new programmes to build the resilience of poor communities and we must scale up key interventions like breastfeeding and fortification of basic foodstuffs.</p><p>Political action should be combined with greater investment from both the private sector and international donors, and we must also address some of the underlying causes – from land use, to the lack of transparency in the food system that helps keep costs high.</p><p>We are not the only ones for whom this is a top priority. Save the Children is working with dozens of other aid agencies to push these issues higher up the agenda next year. We can't afford to wait: research shows that acute malnutrition is actually on the rise for the first time in a decade. Meaningful action on hunger, kick-started here in London in 2012, could be the real legacy of our Olympics; that prize would be worth its weight in gold.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/8/12/1344781223632/Protesters-in-London-call-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/12/2012-hunger-summit-legacy-games","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/12/2012-hunger-summit-legacy-games","sectionName":"Comment

Olympics? The traditional way is to just count up the number of medals won. And the result? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/jun/25/olympic-medal-winner-list-data\">The biggest countries always come top</a>: the Olympic 'superpowers' of the US, China, Russia, UK, Australia and Germany.</p><p>But what if the <a href=\"#total\">totals</a> took account of factors that must have an influence, such as the size of a country's population or its economic power, or compared it to the size of the athletic team in London?</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.rss.org.uk/\">Royal Statistical Society</a> and the Datablog have teamed up with four statisticians at Imperial College, London, to help us work out how those key factors might change the league table. By 'weighting' the medals, what happens to the results?</p><p>The team, <a href=\"http://www.canagnos.com/\">Christoforos Anagnostopoulos</a>, <a href=\"http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~gmontana/\">Giovanni Montana</a>, <a href=\"http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/\">Axel Gandy</a> and <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.mortlock\">Daniel Mortlock</a>, looked at previous olympics and traditional indicators such as the output of a country's economy (GDP), the size of its population - and also ways to weight the score by the size of each country's Olympic team.</p><p>What's the rationale? Take the 2008 results. The Bahamas had a population of approximately 334,000 in 2008, whereas the USA had 304,000,000 - almost 1,000 times larger. And yet the Bahamas won two medals, whereas the US 110 – 55 times as many. \"Taking <a href=\"#pop\">population into account</a>,\" says Anagnostopoulos, \"It no longer seems obvious that the US should rank higher than the Bahamas. The intuition is that the US had a larger pool of possible athletes to choose from, and consequently it makes sense that it should do better, too\".</p><p>So, what will the results look like? Says Anagnostopoulos:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The simplest approach is to divide the number of medals by the population of each country. We will however look at other types of indices that might be harder to interpret directly. Consequently, to make the league table interpretable without reference to the underlying index, we express the results as a (weighted) medal count. As the Games progress, for each medal type (Bronze/Silver/Gold), we redistribute the medals that have been already won, taking into account the country's population: for a small country, one medal will be worth more than for a larger country, and it may therefore end up with 2 or 3 medals, whereas the larger country \"loses\" some of its medals in order to correct for the advantage afforded to it by way of its larger population. The resulting medal count will depend on the relative sizes of the countries of the medal winners, and may change as more medals are added onto the database. We do the same for silvers and golds, as well as for total medal count</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"#gdp\">GDP</a>, is another obvious one to re-size on, particularly when you consider how expensive sport equipment and training is. Moreover, since GDP also grows with population size, it implicitly also takes into account population size.</p><p>Although penalising larger wealthier countries may seem intuitively \"fair\", our statistical team invites us to think harder about the potential arbitrariness of penalties and how they can be selected objectively. Anagnostopoulos explains:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We have been thinking of GDP (or population) as an \"advantage\" that needs to be \"corrected for\" by penalising. This however involves an arbitrary decision of how much to penalise by. A statistician would take a different, more objective view, where GDP is a factor that can, to some extent, explain the performance of various countries. A different, more objective view, would interpret GDP as a factor that can, to some extent, explain the performance of various countries. Once this explanatory potential is exhausted, what 'is left' (the statistical jargon for this is 'residual') can be interpreted as 'GDP-corrected' athletic skill - a purer measure. Crucially, we may then rely on sound principles of statistical modelling to determine fairly conclusively which index is the one that maximises the explanatory power of GDP (and/or population) in this context. The resulting measure is no longer a simple ratio, but a variant of a log scale, which carefully balances the numbers in a fairly complicated way. When the games are over, we will be able to analyse the results based on this work</p></blockquote><p>Reassuringly, however, the main qualitative conclusion of the earlier league tables seems to persist: for instance, in 2008, Cuba comes top, with 24 medals but a small population and GDP. Not all \"superpowers\" are banished, but some are: Australia, China, and Russia maintain their positions in the top 20, whereas the UK and the US are no longer featured.</p><p><a href=\"#team\">Team size</a> is also a factor - and one which our team says may be a better indicator than either GDP or population as it has already taken that into account by team selection.</p><p>And this is what those results look like for for population and GDP, compared to team size: \"A sharper linear relationship is evident after taking logarithms. Further analysis can fine-tune the index to capture as much as possible the effect of GDP and/or population on performance.\" says Anagnostopoulos.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The full data is <a href=\"#data\">below</a> - and we will update it throughout the Games.

If all these people are going to have enough to eat, increases in food production and changes in consumer patterns of behaviour will both be needed. But what will these look like? And what's the best way to make them happen?</p><p>To discuss these questions, Guardian Sustainable Business brought together a range of experts from across the food security and sustainable agriculture debate. The online panel included Richard Perkins, senior commodities adviser at environment charity WWF; Dawn Rittenhouse, director of sustainabilty for US chemicals firm DuPont; Louise Fresco, a sustainability expert at the University of Amsterdam; Justin Smith, head of sustainability at South African retailer Woolworths; Santiago del Solar, an Argentine agronomist and farmer; and Jan Kees Vis, global director sustainable sourcing development at consumer goods firm Unilever. Here's a summary of the six main themes:</p><h2>Sharing knowledge</h2><p>There's no one \"right\" model for farming. Farmers need to respond to local conditions, argued Louise Fresco of the University of Amsterdam. \"Farmers and business should liaise with communities to orient … production\", she pointed out. By the same token, farmers have a lot to learn from one another. Knowledge gaps are especially significant in the developing world, where tomorrow's hungry mouths will mostly be found. Why are rice yields so much lower in India than China, for example? So there's a strong case for sharing best practices. Yet warnings were voiced against imposing outside recommendations wholesale. As debate participant Robynne Anderson observed: \"scaling up in a farmer context is often best done through farmer organisations and extension services.\"</p><h2>Measuring performance</h2><p>Okay, so it might not sound like the most thrilling solution, but data matters. We can't analyse the problem without the right numbers. DuPont's Dawn Rittenhouse pointed towards a US programme called <a href=\"http://www.fieldtomarket.org/\">Field to Market</a> that has devised comparable outcome metrics for agricultural improvement projects. Woolworths is rolling out a similar approach across its agriculture suppliers. Farming for the Future operates within an 80-point audit protocol based on soil health. It's proven effective at \"reducing inputs, driving water efficiency, protecting biodiversity and maintaining or even growing yields\", Justin Smith remarked. A word of caution, however: adding to producers' paperwork won't be welcomed down on the farm. There's a multitude of certification schemes out there already: Tesco Nurture, Leaf, Organic, Freedom Food, and so forth. \"Too many standards, too many questions to farmers\", noted Unilever's Jan Kees Vis. Better to have one harmonised standard – albeit it's difficult to draw up.</p><h2>Keeping it local – or not</h2><p>The trope of our times - Think global, Act local – drew mixed responses. Received wisdom is that food miles are bad news. If we need to feed the world, we need to grow what we need on our doorsteps. Yet analysis by Unilever suggests only 2-3% of the global carbon footprint of your average food product comes from transport. WWF's Perkins conceded that the case for going local isn't as easy as it sounds. Sure, we want to avoid air-freighting food around the globe, but we also don't want to be growing carbon-heavy, out-of-season greenhouse crops just so that they are local. Instead, he suggested that it made sense to \"grow things where they grow best … and trade them\".</p><h2>Reducing waste</h2><p>Feeding 9 billion people by 2050 doesn't necessarily mean a revolution in agricultural productivity. Simply stopping waste in the food chain will get us a good way towards where we need to be. There's much to be done at the producer end, particularly with respect to post-harvest loses. DuPont's Dawn Rittenhouse cites the example of dairy farming in Kenya. Her company co-developed a new enzyme that slowed the spoilage of milk, thus preserving milk during transportation from the farm. Information technology can also play a role. Participants cited IT innovations like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23phones4farmers?q=%23phones4farmers\" title=\"\">#phones4farmers </a>and <a href=\"http://www.icow.co.ke/\" title=\"\">iCow</a>. Not all solutions need be high tech. Grain farmer Santiago del Solar noted how producers in his home country use huge plastic storage bags to make up for missing silos. \"It's an Argentinean solution\", he said, \"cheap and clean\".</p><p>Reducing waste at the other end of the food cycle is equally important. Unilever's Jan Kees Vis argued that food should be affordable, not cheap, as \"cheap food leads to waste\". Business has a key role to play here. The new<a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/hospitality-and-food-service-wraps-work-0\" title=\"\"> UK Hospitality and Food Service Agreement</a> offers a prime example of an industry sector linking with government and non-profits to tackle the problem. Getting consumers to think about food use is the primary concern, however. That requires food retailers to get involved. \"I guess our role is also to focus on not promoting bulk purchases where this is unnecessary\", said Woolworth's Justin Smith. Discounting \"normal\" sized portions could be one solution. Information on production methods is also helpful, said Louise Fresco, but only if it's easy to understand.</p><h2>Engaging youth</h2><p>Food security is an issue that today's young people will become only too aware of. So engage them now in sustainable consumption, the panel agreed. On the consumer side, several participants called for more work in schools. UK supermarket Sainsbury's was cited for its work promoting gardening in schools. Don't forget tomorrow's farmers either. Young people need to be persuaded that farming can provide a viable future. For that to happen, it requires them to have the skills to farm efficiently, as well as the incentive of being paid fairly. Companies can contribute in both cases.</p><h2>Collaborating together</h2><p>If there was one message that rang our throughout the discussion, it was the need for collaboration. \"For emerging market businesses, much of the focus needs to be on creating partnership opportunities that bring more small scale farmers\", said Justin Smith. Matching small-scale suppliers with well-resourced primary suppliers is the kind of solution he had in mind. Jan Kees Vis had a word for the big players too: cooperation, not competition, has to be the watchword going forward. It's time to reaffirm sustainable agriculture as a \"pre-competitive issue\", he said. The time is also right to start \"re-connecting\" in supply chains: e.g. linking end users to primary producers. \"I have taken Unilever Board members to tea estates in Africa, to oil palm plantations in Malaysia, to tomato farms in Italy ... [This is] a necessary step to get to more collaboration.\"</p><p>To read the whole discussion, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/feeding-world-nine-billion-population\" title=\"\">please click here</a>.</p><p><em>This article forms part of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/series/letstalksustainableliving\" title=\"\"><em>Let's talk sustainable living</em></a><em>, a series of thought provoking conversations around the big challenges facing companies in making sustainable living mainstream.

Click image to explore it</figcaption></figure><p><strong></strong></p><p><a name=\"age\"></p><h2>Age</h2><p></a><br />If you imagine that all Olympic athletes are young, then you would be wrong – while the average is 26, there are 187 athletes over 40 at this year's games, including the eldest, <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/hoketsu-hiroshi-1026976/\">Hiroshi Hoketsu</a>, 71 years old, who competed in the dressage for Japan. There are two 65 year-olds: <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/kuzmins-afanasijs-1088425/\">Afanasijs Kuzmins</a>  is a Latvian shooter and <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/millar-ian-1076634/\">Ian Millar</a>, a Canadian show jumper. Most over-50s are competing in equestrian and shooting but there is a 52 female rower, Canadian <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/thompson-willie-lesley-1076889/\">Lesley Thompson-Willie</a>  who has won silver in the women's eight – and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/06/london-2012-olympics-day-10-live-blog\">Britain's oldest gold medal winner, 54-year-old Nick Skelton</a>. </p><p>Look at each sport and there's a lot of variation too: rhythmic gymnastics has an average age of 19 – while for the equestrian events it's 38. But within that there are still some surprises: mountain bike cycling for instance, has an average age of 33 and for beach volleyball it's 29. The youngest Olympian is a Togan women's 50m freestyle competitor, <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/kpossi-adzo-259469/\">Adzo Kpossi</a>, who is just 13, one of 33 Olympians aged 15 and under. </p><p>And it varies by country too – with the caveat that this probably reflects the sports they are entering. The French team average is 27 – a year above the overall figure. For Germany it's the same, and the Danish team has an average of 28. Overall, the youngest team is Laos, but it only has three members, two of whom are aged 16 or under. Of the teams with over 100 members, China's is the youngest at an average of 24.3 and Sweden's is the oldest – with an average age of 28.4. </p><p><a name=\"height\"></p><h2>Height</h2><p></a></p><p>Height and weight are dependent on sex. Taking a look at men's heights, the tallest male athlete stands at 2.21m is Chinese basketball player <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/zhang-zhaoxu-1070360/\">Zhaoxu Zhang</a>  but a close second is 23-year-old Russian volleyball player, <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/muserskiy-dmitriy-1013464/\">Dmitriy Muserskiy</a> at 2.18m. The shortest is a 21-year-old Tuvaluan weight lifter standing at 1.40m tall, <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/lapua-lapua-1116789/\">Lapua Lapua</a>.  The tallest female athlete is a basketball player from China, <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/wei-wei-1070387/\">Wei Wei</a> who is 7cm over the 2m mark. The shortest is Jamaica's 4 X 100 relay runner <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/calvert-schillonie-1020557/\">Schillonie Calvert</a>, standing at just 1.35m.</p><p>Serbia, with 108 athletes, is the tallest of the bigger teams – standing at a proud average of 1.86m, nearby Croatia is just behind at 1.85m. Iceland's 25 athletes are the tallest though – towering over the rest at an average of 1.9m. The smallest big team are the Japanese – at 1.7m, although the successful North Korean team has an average height of 1.62m.</p><p><a name=\"weight\"></p><h2>Weight </h2><p></a><br />Weights were a bit trickier in that certain sports (Boxing, Gymnastics, Synchronised swimming, Taekwondo and Trampoline) did not give weights for their athletes. Taking this into account, the heaviest male athlete is <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/blas-jr-ricardo-1023625/\">Ricardo Blas Jr</a>, a Judo competitor from Guam. The lightest is China's <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/cao-yuan-1072164/\">Yuan Cao</a> who won a gold in the Men's Synchronised 10m Diving. The heaviest woman is an American weightlifter, <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/mangold-holley-1134179/\">Holley Mangold</a>, weighing in at 157kg. The lightest woman is <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/hu-yadan-1072149/\">Yadan Hu</a> from China. Weighing just 36kg she competed in the 10m Diving.</p><p>Croatia – one of the tallest teams – is also one of the heaviest: its average weight is 84kg, just above Serbia. The lightest large team is Colombia's group of 106 athletes at an average of only 63.4kg, followed closely by Japan at 64.2kg.</p><p><a name=\"bmi\"></p><h2>Body mass</h2><p></a><br />An interesting find in the data is that even though height and weight is dependent on sex, the sports which have the highest/lowest average weight/heights are the same for both sexes. We even checked for average BMI. The sport with the highest average height is of course basketball with an average of 2m for men and 1m 87cm for women. The sport with the shortest athletes is Artistic Gymnastics with an average height of 1m 67cm for men and 1m 55cm for women. The sport with the highest BMI is weightlifting and the sport with the lowest is the Triathlon.</p><p><a name=\"compared\"></p><h2>Team GB v Team USA</h2><p></a></p><p>Britain and the United States have the largest two teams in the Olympics with over 1,000 athletes between them – but how do they compare?</p><p>Well, team GB is younger, lighter and smaller than their trans-Atlantic counterparts. Its average age is 26.3, compared to 27.1 for the US – a gap of 3%. It is also 2% lighter at an average of 74.5kg, compared to 75.9kg.</p><p>The full data is <a href=\"#data\">below</a>.

It includes John Podesta, former White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, Yingfan Wang, a Chinese career diplomat on the advocacy group that promotes the implementation of the MDGs, and Andris Piebalgs, the EU's development commissioner. Twelve of the panellists are women.</p><p></p><p>Amina Mohammed, special adviser of the UN secretary general on post-2015 development planning, will serve in an ex officio capacity on the panel.</p><p></p><p>Representing academia on the panel are Abhijit Banerjee, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the co-author of <a href=\"http://pooreconomics.com/\" title=\"\">Poor Economics</a>.</p><p></p><p>Representing the private sector will be Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever.</p><p></p><p>\"I have asked my high-level panel to prepare a bold yet practical development vision to present to member states next year,\" said Ban. \"I look forward to the panel's recommendations on a global post-2015 agenda with shared responsibilities for all countries, and with the fight against poverty and sustainable development at its core.\"</p><p></p><p>The panel's task is to come up with recommendations for a post-2015 development agenda, building on the MDGs and with a view to ending poverty. The agenda will be built on economic growth, social equality and environmental sustainability. The panel is expected to work closely with an intergovernmental group on the sustainable development goals, as agreed at the Rio+20 conference. The reports of both groups will be submitted to member states for their deliberations.</p><p></p><p>Andrew Mitchell, the UK's international development secretary, welcomed the naming of the panel, praising its expertise and diversity. \"The prime minister will work with his two co-chairs and the panellists to lead an inclusive and transparent process which draws on the views and experiences of citizens, businesses, aid agencies and countries across the world,\" said Mitchell.</p><p></p><p>\"This will need to build on the success of the millennium development goals, but also respond to the new global challenges of the 21st century by helping economies and societies to flourish and to free the poorest countries from poverty for good.\"</p><p></p><p>Not everyone was so enthusiastic. John Hilary from <a href=\"http://www.waronwant.org/\" title=\"\">War on Want</a>, the anti-poverty group, criticised the panel for being unrepresentative. \"Ban Ki-moon has put together a panel of career diplomats, business leaders, politicians and professors,\" said Hilary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/24/david-cameron-un-development-panel?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">who strongly criticised the appointment of Cameron as co-chair</a>. \"Why is there no one at all from social movements, trade unions or people who are actually engaged in the struggle against poverty? Was there genuinely no room for a single representative from civil society? This is like having a panel to take forward women's empowerment composed entirely of men.\"</p><p></p><p>Brendan Cox, director of policy and advocacy at Save the Children, welcomed the appointment of the panel, but warned against a weak outcome. \"The major danger that the panel must avoid is agreeing a watered-down framework containing no specific targets,\" he said. \"To avoid this, the panel must ensure an open process that considers the views of people living in poverty and builds political support right from the start. It must also build on the successes of the MDGs, continuing to set and work towards measurable goals that mobilise commitment and ensure accountability, while taking into account emerging challenges, such as sustainability and the growing inequalities of the world.\"</p><p></p><h2>The panellists</h2><p><strong>Fulbert Géro Amoussouga (Benin)</strong> Heads Benin's economic analysis unit of the president of the republic of Benin.</p><p></p><p><strong>Vanessa Petrelli Corrêa (Brazil)</strong> President of the Institute for Applied Economic Research, which conducts research to support the design and implementation of governmental policies and development programmes in Brazil.</p><p></p><p><strong>Yingfan Wang (China)</strong> Member of the secretary general's MDG advocacy group and a career diplomat.</p><p></p><p><strong>María Ángela Holguín (Colombia)</strong> Foreign minister of Colombia.</p><p></p><p><strong>Gisela Alonso (Cuba)</strong> President of the Cuban agency of environment.</p><p></p><p><strong>Jean-Michel Severino (France)</strong> Former director general of the French development agency.</p><p></p><p><strong>Horst Köhler (Germany)</strong> President of Germany 2004-10.</p><p></p><p><strong>Naoto Kan (Japan)</strong> Former prime minister of Japan.

It made it easier for the teachers.\"</p><p>On one occasion, Mabuse reprimanded one of his classmates for answering a mobile phone during a lesson.</p><p>He said: \"She blurted out at the top of her voice. I was livid, I said you can't disturb a class just to talk to someone outside. I said I'm old fashioned, I believe in showing respect, we should turn all phones off. She understood and apologised as well.\"</p><p>The effort paid off as Mabuse passed the secondary school leaving exam known as matric in English, history, geography, business economics, accounting, technology and Sesotho (a Bantu language).</p><p>His reaction? \"I'm elated,\" he said. \"I'm just over the moon. I had set out to do this thing and the joy is indescribable. I really wanted to do it for myself and my late parents. They would be pleased, wherever they are.\"</p><p>Mabuse, who is divorced, said his six children encouraged him. \"They said you can't expect us to be educated so much when you're not. I felt I had to lead by example and they're very proud of me.\"</p><p>One of children is the singer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPHO\" title=\"\">Mpho Skeef</a>, who was brought up in London by her mother and stepfather.</p><p>Mabuse also has the support of \"big brother\" Hugh Masekela, a South African trumpeter.</p><p>South Africa president Jacob Zuma joined the chorus of praise. \"On behalf of the government and the people of South Africa, we extend our sincere congratulations to Mabuse for achieving this amazing milestone at his age,\" he said.</p><p>\"You are indeed an inspiration to all of us by showing us that one is never too old for education.</p><p>\"We admire your tenacity, discipline and your zeal to succeed and wish you well in all your future endeavours.\"</p><p>South Africa's education system is in strife. Fewer than half of all school leavers pass matric.

Remember we came from the apartheid system.</p><p>\"I'm not saying blame apartheid for the incompetence of government ministers, but we have to be aware of where we've come from.\"</p><p>Now considering studying music at university, he feels that his experience demonstrates the intrinsic value of education.</p><p>\"The best empowerment you can give to people is to give them an education.

We deal with country flags and names all the time so we perhaps have  more sympathy than most when it comes to country names and details. At the Guardian, we call North Korea just that. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) calls it DPR (which stands for Democratic People's Republic of) Korea and South Korea just Korea. Confusingly South Korea's official name - <a href=\"http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes/country_names_and_code_elements_txt.htm\">according to the ISO, which makes rules about these things </a>- is Republic of Korea.</p><p>And we're not talking about language differences: even in English, countries have different names.

He worked for the National Basketball Association public relations department through the 2008 Olympics, and the experience stoked a passion for FIBA hoops. The passion for PR was quite abating, if it ever existed at all. So he quit his job, and devoted his full time to making a public spectacle of his basketball obsession. So far, the decision has paid off emotionally and monetarily, but mostly because his standards are so low for both thresholds. Strauss has written for <a href=\"http://ESPN.com\">ESPN.com</a>, <a href=\"http://Salon.com\">Salon.com</a>, The Classical, Dime Magazine, Free Darko. He's quite thrilled at the prospect of  speaking to a broader international audience, because \"\"basketball as a unifying force\"\" is the kind of touching trope that wrings water from his oft-rolled eyes. He's rooting for the United States in theory, but his intellectual vanity is hoping that Spain shows them up.

At 13 she joined Horsham Ladies and by 14 she was moved up to the Horsham Ladies Senior team where her coach moved her to centre half and she quickly made her mark and an impact in the FA National Southern Division.  Two seasons later in September 1995, at just 16 she became the first ever player outside of the FA National Premier League to be selected for a England training session. Word spread quickly and she was scouted by Arsenal Ladies and joined them in 1996. In her first full season for the Gunners she was voted FA National Player of the Year in 1996/97. Over the next 15 years Faye has gone on to win a total of 34 major trophies with Arsenal Ladies including 3 Domestic trebles, 10 League championships, 9 FA Cup  and the biggest prize of all, the UEFA Champions League in 2007 (formally named Uefa Womens Cup).  She was named Club captain in 2002 and still remains it to this date. Faye made her debut for England against Scotland as a sub in 1997 and in 2002 Faye achieved the biggest honour of all when she was named England Captain. She went on to lead her country at four major tournaments, including 2 World Cups and 2 European Championships, where in 2009 they reached the European Final and ended up as silver medallist to Germany in Finland.  After 16 long years Faye announced her international retirement this year after the news that she is expecting her first child. As Captain of both club and country Faye has worked tirelessly at promoting and raising the profile of the women's game and one of her biggest passions is being a positive role model for future young female players.  In 2006 Faye was awarded an MBE for her services to Football. Off the pitch Faye has also gained a lot of experience working with the media and appears regularly as a pundit for the women's game on the BBC, Sky and ESPN.

Andrew has written for the UK's leading hockey magazine 'Push' on the diverse topics of gender equality, professionalisation and sausage rolls. Despite an international hockey pedigree Andrew's relative lack of ability has meant that the closest he came to selection for 2012 was when his moustache was self-appointed to the Great Britain Hockey squad's Movember team. Other notable achievements include playing national league hockey both in goal and outfield, holding the Durham University all time top  scoring record, and missing two penalty strokes in one game. In his time away from the hockey field Andrew eats, sleeps and occasionally works as a digital media consultant - advising brands on how to make friends on-line.

golden moments to look out for at London 2012","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-20T22:03:17Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/blog/2012/jul/20/10-olympic-moments-to-watch","fields":{"body":"<h2>1. Men's 100m final, <strong>Sunday 5 Aug 9.50pm</strong></h2><p>To understand just how special this 100m final is likely to be, you need to cast your mind back to the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008. It was there, in the Bird's Nest, that Usain Bolt reinvented the 100m, smashing his own world record – despite slowing down to celebrate 10m from the finish line – and obliterating the rest of the field. In his own words he \"blew the world's mind\". As he celebrated his extraordinary achievement, 9.69seconds on a go slow, the young Jamaican danced the \"Nuh Linga\" barefoot, his arms intertwined with the Jamaica flag, spikes in his huge hands. It is easy to forget that the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, criticised him at the time for showboating. Since then Bolt's antics have become the sport's biggest selling point.</p><p>Over the following four years that magical moment in Beijing has become legendary. And since then Bolt has, for the most part, looked invincible. Three more world records followed at the world championships in 2009. In five years Bolt has been defeated only three times. That is quite a record.</p><p>For a long time it seemed that no one would ever beat him in a major championship final. This year, though, it may happen. Bolt's training partner, Yohan Blake, inherited the 100m world title after Bolt false-started in the final last year. Some dismissed that victory as a fluke but at the Jamaican Olympic trials this summer Blake confirmed his pedigree. Blowing away the rest of the field, including Bolt, the 22-year-old posted the fastest time of the year to set up a thrilling contest in London. With USA's Justin Gatlin and Tyson Gay also coming into form the men's 100m is no longer just a phenomenal one-man show.</p><p>In Stratford the most competitive final in years is likely to unfold. Even if you are not lucky enough to have a ticket, even if you hate sport, if you watch one Olympic event, make it this one. <strong>Anna Kessel</strong></p><h2><strong>2. </strong>Women's 400m freestyle, Sunday 29 July 8.15pm</h2><p>The British press and public get so excited about Rebecca Adlington, goodness knows what they will make of Federica Pellegrini. The Italian, only 23, is Adlington's main rival for the 400m freestyle. She has won four world titles since Beijing, beating Adlington over 400m in both 2009 and 2011. She is implausibly glamorous, improbably beautiful and a complete diva. In 2009 she posed naked for Vogue, her body spray-painted gold. And earlier this year she did another nude shoot for Vanity Fair, flaunting her tattooed body in a series of snaps that showed her sharing hugs and kisses with her boyfriend in bed. Before she settled down with her current partner, the former world 100m freestyle champion Filippo Magnini, Pellegrini was in a relationship with another Italian swimmer, Luca Marin. He had been engaged to her French freestyle rival Laure Manaudou but he left her for Pellegrini. Two year's later Pellegrini took Manaudou's world title, too.</p><p>None of this has any bearing on Adlington, or the showdown between the pair in the pool, but it does all help make Pellegrini one of the most compelling personalities in her sport. She has more sprinting speed than Adlington, doubling-up the 400m with the 200m freestyle, while the Briton goes the other way and also swims in the 800m.</p><p>So their 400m contest is a battle between speed and endurance. Since Adlington defeated her in Beijing, Pellegrini has tended to get the better of her British rival, beating her in two world championship finals. This year both are behind France's Camille Muffat in the world rankings, so the 400m is going to be a three-way tussle.</p><p>Adlington will start as the favourite for the 800m freestyle title but she faces fierce competition from Pellegrini and Muffat in the 400m. If she can beat them, she will go down as one of the greatest Olympians in British history. <strong>Andy Bull</strong></p><h2><strong>3. </strong>Women's heptathlon, <strong>Friday 3 Aug 10.05am</strong></h2><p>Four years ago Jessica Ennis sat at home, her right ankle in a plaster cast, watching the Olympic Games on the TV and crying into a pillow. The Sheffield heptathlete had been the up-and-coming star expected to make an impact in Beijing. Instead she was sidelined by a potentially career-ending injury. Ennis was not a household name back then but fast forward to 2012 and the 26-year-old is the face of the Games, the nation's favourite athlete, with a stack of medals to her name including world indoor (pentathlon) and outdoor as well as European golds.</p><p>Until last summer it had looked as if Ennis would cruise to the Olympic title this year, such was her dominance. But at the world championships in Daegu everything changed. A terrible throw in the javelin – she was 21st out of 26 in her weakest event – left Ennis in dire straits and Tatyana Chernova, a 23-year-old Russian who won Olympic bronze in 2008, took the world title. Worse was to come in March this year as Ennis was again unable to defend her world title – indoors this time – with the defending Olympic champion, Nataliya Dobrynska, winning gold.Just as sceptics began doubting her chances, Ennis hit back in May, beating the world's elite in Götzis with a personal best of 6,906 points, making her the eighth best heptathlete ever. And she reckons she has only just begun to show her potential.</p><p>With Ennis in the prime of her life, the battle between her and Chernova is bound to be fascinating. While the Briton's compact stature helps her to excel in the 100m hurdles, the first event, and 200m dash, as well as assisting her to victory in the high jump – all on the first day of the competition – the 6ft 2in Russian comes into her own on day two in the long jump, javelin and the strength-sapping 800m, the seventh and final event at 8.35pm on Saturday.</p><p>The defending champion, Dobrynska, cannot be written off either, nor can the USA's Beijing silver medallist, Hyleas Fountain.</p><p>Whether Ennis' newest domestic rival, the Liverpudlian world youth champion, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who recently smashed Ennis's junior record, can make any impression on her Oympic debut will add further interest.<strong>Anna Kessel</strong></p><h2><strong>4. Men's individual platform diving, Saturday 11 Aug 8.30pm</strong></h2><p>Platform diving is one of the classic Olympic sports. For three years and 50 weeks of the cycle no one pays it much attention and most people could not be bothered to press the red button to watch it. But for the 14 days the competition lasts, everyone is a fan and a fair few start fancying themselves as experts too: \"Just look how little splash he made on that tucked four-and-a-half-somersault!\"</p><p>Even if Tom Daley were not competing, the diving would be worth tuning in for – it is breathtakingly beautiful, and mind-bogglingly athletic – but his participation means it is going to be one of the must-see events. It has been five years since Daley started making headlines as a 13-year-old. Since then he finished seventh at the Beijing Olympics, won the world championship, three BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year awards, two European titles and a Commonwealth gold. He has also had to do an awful lot of growing up in the public eye. He had a public falling out with his dive partner Blake Aldridge in Beijing, lost his father Rob to cancer in 2011 and had a spat with GB's performance director, Alexei Evangulov, who accused him of being too distracted by his commercial work. All the while his life seems to have been building towards the 2012 Olympics.</p><p>Daley is not favourite for the gold. That is Qiu Bo, the Chinese world No1 who is a level above and beyond everyone else. \"Nobody's going to beat him unless he drops a dive. If he doesn't drop, he won't be beaten,\" says Daley's coach, Andy Banks, of Bo.</p><p>But there is some cause for hope – in the past Bo has tended to crack under pressure. He did at Beijing in 2008 and again at the world championships in 2009. <strong>Andy Bull</strong></p><h2><strong>5. Women's match sprint, Tuesday 7 Aug 5.26pm</strong></h2><p>The two divas of sprint cycling, Anna Meares and Victoria Pendleton, between them have more history than Time Team but forget the wars of words, the difference in their approach and their temperaments. What makes their rivalry unique is how hard they can drive each other. If they meet in a semi-final the duel always leaves the winner emotionally and physically drained for the final.</p><p>Their contest for the world championship semi-final in Melbourne this year was the high point to date, including a crash for Pendleton and interventions by the judges as the pair pushed the rules of racing to the very limit. It swung first one way, then the other, with Pendleton coming out the unexpected winner for the sixth world title of her career.</p><p>Their rivalry goes back to 2006, when Meares cut her English rival up in a Derny-paced race. In 2008, in winning the Olympic final, Pendleton declared that she had wanted to humiliate the Australian rather than merely beat her. Since then there has been much debate over whether the pair actually detest each other or would really like to go out for a beer or three.</p><p>The far more muscular Meares uses her sheer strength and qualifying speed to establish an advantage from the start of a sprint tournament, whereas Pendleton, mentally more fragile as well as physically susceptible to injury, is a slower qualifier who relies on her superior pedalling speed. Recently Meares has looked to have the upper hand, winning last year's world title and two gold medals at the world's this year, but Pendleton now has momentum on her side and has gained in self-belief. The ultimate twist, however, is that Pendleton will quit after London. This time round it is not just personal; it is final. <strong>William Fotheringham</strong></p><h2><strong>6. Women's pole vault, Monday 6 Aug 7pm</strong></h2><p>A more contrasting pair could not be imagined: Yelena Isinbayeva, the pole vault world indoor and outdoor record holder and known for being one of the most glamorous female athletes on the circuit, versus Preston's Holly Bleasdale, a down-to- earth Lancashire lass, aged  20, who began pole vaulting only in late 2008.</p><p>In a remarkable rise Bleasdale has progressed from a bronze medal at the world junior championships in 2010, Britain's first global medal for a female pole vaulter, with a then career best that ranked her 62nd in the world to the second-highest indoor jump in history after clearing 4.87m in January this year.</p><p>Meanwhile Isinbayeva, a regular magazine cover star, has struggled for form in recent years. The Russian, who has set 28 records in the event, even prompted speculation that she might retire after a series of difficult years – posting three no-jumps at the 2009 world championships and failing to gain any sort of medal at the world indoor championships in 2010 and again at the worlds in 2011. It was there, in Daegu, that Bleasdale rued missing her chance to capitalise on the most recent failure and burst into tears after she failed to register a height in the final.</p><p>This season, however, both women are on form to make this an intriguing and compelling contest. Isinbayeva won the world indoor title in March, where Bleasdale finished third. Then the Briton broke her own national record in poor weather at the Olympic trials in June, propelling her to fifth in the world rankings for this, her breakthrough, season. <strong>Anna Kessel</strong></p><h2><strong>7. Men's 10,000m, Saturday 4 Aug 9.15pm</strong></h2><p>Less than two years ago the notion that Mo Farah would challenge for Kenenisa Bekele's Olympic titles at 5,000m and 10,000m would have seemed bonkers. Back in 2010 Farah's double victory at the European Championships had been impressive but it certainly did not position him as a serious contender on the global stage . He was not even in the world top 10.</p><p>Bekele, by contrast, was – and still is – one of the most astonishing distance runners that ever lived. Unbeaten in the 10,000m between 2003 and 2011, the Ethiopian has three Olympic, five world track and 11 world cross-country titles. He is also the world and Olympic record holder for both events.</p><p>But a major change for Farah – moving to Portland, Oregon, to work under the idiosyncratic coach Alberto Salazar – has seen the Somalia-born Briton pick up a world title over 5,000m, a world silver medal over 10,000m and top the current world rankings. Suddenly the 29-year-old Londoner is looking more and more like the man to beat.</p><p>Key to Farah's success seems to be his ability to embrace knowledge and expertise from two sides of the globe – east and west – in his quest to become the Olympic champion. After living with a group of Kenyan runners during his student days – and observing their near monastic lifestyle of ugali (maize porridge), running and religious TV – Farah has adopted these austere principles. While the rest of the west moaned about East Africans dominating distance running Farah simply beat the opposition at their own game, spending months at a time training at altitude in Kenya, living in basic conditions. At the same time, under Salazar, Farah embraced western technology to improve his training – including an underwater treadmill to prevent injury and a cooling chamber that blasts liquid nitrogen at –300C at his body.</p><p>Who wins may depend on which Bekele starts the race: the one who has struggled with injury of late – dropping out of the 10,000m world championships final last year – or the sensational runner who still set the world's fastest time last year over the distance. <strong>Anna Kessel</strong></p><h2><strong>8. Men's 400m individual medley and 200m individual medley, Saturday 28 Jul 7.30pm &amp; Thursday 2 Aug 8.16pm</strong></h2><p>For Michael Phelps the Beijing Olympics were a procession but London 2012 will be a battle. For the first time Phelps faces a genuine rival to the title of the greatest swimmer in the world – his team-mate Ryan Lochte. The fight between the two of them is going to be one of the defining contests of the Games. Phelps is certain to swim in seven events, Lochte is likely to do six and each expects to win gold in every one. At least one of them is going to be disappointed. Lochte and Phelps, both 27, will go head-to-head in the 200m and 400m medleys, an all-round test of stamina, technique and speed in which the swimmers have to perform all four strokes.</p><p>At the US trials in Omaha, Nebraska, Phelps and Lochte went head-to-head in four events. Phelps won three – the 200m IM, the 200m freestyle and 100m butterfly – while Lochte took the 400m medley. But Phelps's combined margin of victory was a mere three-tenths of a second. Lochte's winning margin was 0.83sec. Of the 16 50m splits the two rivals swam in finals, Phelps was faster in eight, Lochte in seven and there was one tie. Lochte is the world record holder for the 200m medley, Phelps in the 400m. All of which is another way of saying that there is almost nothing between them.</p><p>Phelps has already won more gold medals than any Olympian in history – eight in Beijing, six in Athens. He needs three more medals, of any colour, to overtake the Russian gymnast Larisa Latynina as the most decorated Olympian ever. The Aquatics Centre should see his coronation as the greatest competitor in Olympic history but it could also see him lose his crown as the best swimmer in the world. <strong>Andy Bull</strong></p><h2><strong>9. Men's four final, Saturday 4 Aug 10.30am</strong></h2><p>There is only one Olympic sport, away from the swimming pool, in which the winners cross the line backwards. It means the leaders can see their pursuers gaining on them, one of the reasons why top-class rowing can be such a compelling spectacle. Think of Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell and Tim Foster chasing down the Italians in Sydney in 2000, judging their surge to perfection. A similarly epic contest beckons in perhaps the flagship race of the 2012 Games, the men's four.</p><p>In the red, white and blue will be the quartet of Alex Gregory, Andrew Triggs-Hodge, Pete Reed and Tom James. Determined to ruin everything is the Australian crew of William Lockwood, James Chapman, Drew Ginn and Joshua Dunkley-Smith. It will have the crackle of Lord's on the first morning of an Ashes Test, albeit on a slightly damper pitch.</p><p>The rivalry between the two crews is already intense. Great Britain won the first two World Cup events in Belgrade and Lucerne this year, establishing a new world-best time in the latter race. Subsequently, though, the British quartet suffered two defeats in Munich last month. The Poms started poorly in the final and duly finished second. The spur of competing on home water should make a difference and the British four are also the reigning Olympic champions. Last time in Beijing – with Steve Williams in the boat rather than Gregory – they saw off Australia and France in a thrilling finish, coming from behind over the final 220 metres to pip the Aussies.</p><p>Triggs-Hodge and Reed, a naval officer, subsequently opted to row as a pair before reverting to their original boat. Gregory, from Worcestershire, and James, a proud Welshman, were born on the same day in March 1984. If the quartet can win again, it will be a triumph of competitive will as much as anything else. British rowing is hoping for a memorable Games and this race could be the thrilling pinnacle. <strong>Robert Kitson</strong></p><h2><strong>10. Men's road race, Saturday 28 July 10am</strong></h2><p>A potential thriller on day one of the Games with a true British sporting great in centre stage, the twist being that crossing the line first will be the biggest ask of Mark Cavendish's career. Taking the gold medal is by no means a given and may prove beyond him but he has embraced the challenge wholeheartedly.</p><p>The Manxman is legendary as the fastest sprinter in the world on a flat course, with a massive tally of stage wins in the Tour de France and a world road race title to his name. But the circuit over Box Hill is a different proposition – to have a chance of getting over the long, steep climb nine times at race speed he has had to lose half a stone in weight, sacrificing a little of his famous sprint velocity, and he has trained specially over the climb behind a motorbike to simulate race conditions. A one-day race over this kind of circuit is impossible to predict, will be hard to read on the day and, with only five riders per team, will be the devil itself to control. It is a lottery but the dream scenario for Cavendish is that the field is in one big group when the race arrives for the finish on The Mall.</p><p>All the other nations in the race will know that, if that is the scenario, he is likely to win, so they will spend most of the 250km trying to burn him off and his four team-mates will try to prevent them. It should be a full-blooded spectacle. What is at stake for Cavendish – a gold medal at home, on top of the world road race title he won last year – is what makes this one enthralling but the uncertainty makes it unique. <strong>William Fotheringham</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/7/10/1341915037562/Olympics---Jessica-Ennis-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/20/10-olympic-moments-to-watch","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/20/10-olympic-moments-to-watch","sectionName":"Sport"},{"webTitle":"Britons in trouble abroad: where are you most likely to be arrested?

the FCO handling more than 20 assistance cases for every 10,000 Britons living or visiting the islands in 2011/12.</p><p>Thailand and Jamaica sit second and third, and are the only two other countries with rates of more than ten cases per 10,000 Britons.</p><p>Despite accounting nominally for more cases than any other country worldwide, Spain fares better with this measure, given the enormous volume of Britons who either reside or holiday there.</p><p>The FCO received more than 5,000 requests for assistance in 2011/12 from people in Spain, but spread across the 13 million Britons spending

action\" is required if countries in sub-Saharan Africa are to meet UN targets on cutting HIV infections in children.</p><p>The 140-page <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/en/\">UNAids report</a> said seven out of 22 countries identified as a priority – Angola, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania and India – were in danger of not reaching the target of cutting child HIV infections by 90% from 2009 levels by 2015.</p><p>The report, published in Washington on Wednesday ahead of the 19th international Aids conference, said a further seven priority countries – Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Lesotho, Malawi and Uganda – could reach the target if the decline in new HIV infections among children is accelerated.</p><p>Eight countries – Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe – will reach the goal if current progress is maintained through 2015.</p><p>Among the 21 priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the number of children newly infected with HIV fell from 360,000 in 2009 to 270,000 in 2011, UNAids said, and with increased effort the target can probably be met.</p><p>The world as a whole is \"close to being on track\" to hit targets of treating 15 million people who are living with HIV. Progress has been especially impressive in sub-Saharan Africa, the report said, where nearly 6.2 million people were receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2011 – up from only 100,000 in 2003.</p><p>The improved treatment level has saved lives – with the estimated life-years saved in the region increasing more than fourfold between 2008 and 2011. The number of deaths from Aids-related causes in the region has declined from a peak of 1.8 million a year in 2005 – to 1.2 million in 2011.</p><p>The 21 priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa account for 90% of pregnant women living with HIV worldwide – making their progress crucial in hitting the target of halving the number of pregnant women dying from Aids-related causes.</p><p>Among those countries and India, the number of pregnancy-related deaths among mothers with HIV fell from 41,500 in 2005 to 33,000 in 2010.</p><p>Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAids, said: \"With the momentum being generated by the global plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections among children by 2015 and keeping their mothers alive, the international community has set a strong course to achieve an Aids-free generation.\"</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/en/\">UNAIDS</a></p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/en/\">UNAIDS</a></p><h2>Data summary</h2><p><strong> </strong></p><p><a name=\"data\"></p><h2>Download the data</h2><p></a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhORuxOwZhGydFNELXRxVm5ISVF3X1dCOXF0NUxZSWc\">DATA: download the first spreadsheet</a><br />• <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhORuxOwZhGydDRjVG1GZng5cDNBQTVILVQ4WGlsWnc\">DATA: download the second spreadsheet</a></p><h2>More data</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p><h2>World government data</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p><h2>Development and aid data</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p><h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2><p>• <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br />• Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2010/9/18/1284823402979/The-mother-of-a-young-chi-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2012/jul/18/sub-saharan-africa-child-hiv-infection-unaids","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/datablog/2012/jul/18/sub-saharan-africa-child-hiv-infection-unaids","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Which are the laziest countries on earth?","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-18T11:24:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2012/jul/18/physical-inactivity-country-laziest","fields":{"body":"<p>This may be an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/series/london-2012-olympics-data\">Olympic summer</a>, but the majority of Britons are more likely to watch the athletes rather than try and emulate them. </p><p>Research <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)60816-2/abstract\">published in the Lancet today</a> shows that the UK, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jul/18/uk-inactive-population-europe\">Sarah Boseley writes</a></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>has the third most slothful population in Europe, with two-thirds of adults failing to take enough physical exercise to keep themselves healthy, according to research.

He added: \"Not only is the document base vast, it is very high quality.\"</p><p>The veterans' lawyers also argue that some potential witnesses who could give evidence on behalf of the government are still alive.</p><p>The lawyers have retained a number of historians who argue that the claimants could not have brought a case before now because of the manner in which the abuses were systematically denied and concealed, not only by colonial officials in Kenya but by senior civil servants and government ministers in London.</p><p>One of them, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/caroline-elkins\" title=\"\">Caroline Elkins</a>, a Pulitzer prize-winning Harvard professor, submitted a statement to the court on Monday which said the wide-scale destruction of documents was part of \"an explicit effort to shape an archival record and British colonial legacy in Kenya\".</p><p>The documents that survived were held for decades amid strict security at Hanslope Park, the home a <a href=\"http://www.hmgcc.gov.uk/technology-research.aspx\" title=\"\">government research centre</a> that provides technical help to the security and intelligence agencies.</p><p>Once the FCO acknowledged the cache's existence and allowed the veterans' lawyers to see its contents, it became clear, according to Elkins, that both Whitehall officials and the colonial administration in Nairobi sanctioned the abuse of detainees and then suppressed the evidence, and that the British army had been responsible for the \"creation, maintenance and application of systems of abuse\".</p><p>Another historian, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/anderson-david\" title=\"\">David Anderson</a>, professor of African politics at Oxford, said the files showed that one European settler, Jack Hopcraft, painstakingly documented the abuses perpetrated against his employees and that colonial officials chose to ignore him.</p><p>The newly obtained documents show that colonial officials and police officers were aware that prisoners were being raped, beaten, whipped and subjected to summary execution. Even children were killed. Eight white officers accused of \"roasting detainees alive\" were granted an amnesty.</p><p>One letter from 1953 shows that the colony's attorney general, Eric Griffith-Jones, expressed concern that the treatment of detainees was \"distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia\".</p><p>Despite this, he drafted legislation that sanctioned a form of beatings known as \"dilution technique\", and then warned the then governor, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Baring,_1st_Baron_Howick_of_Glendale\" title=\"\">Evelyn Baring</a>, of the need for complete secrecy, because \"if we are going to sin, we must sin quietly.\"</p><p>Senior officials in both countries were aware that this dilution technique could result in serious injury or death. But the previously secret archive makes clear that in 1959, when 11 detainees were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hola_massacre\" title=\"\">beaten to death at a camp at Hola</a> in south-east Kenya, the then UK attorney general, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Manningham-Buller,_1st_Viscount_Dilhorne\" title=\"\">Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller</a>, worked to shift the blame from London to Nairobi.</p><p>Although senior Red Cross officials visited Kenya and witnessed the dilution technique being applied, no mention was made of the beatings in their final report. Its author, Henri Junod, a friend of Baring, even confessed to being \"impressed by the work\", and told British officials that they were \"angels of mercy\" compared with the French in Algeria.</p><p>While an estimated one to one-and-a-half tonnes of documents were destroyed in Kenya, those that did survive and were archived at Hanslope Park include copies of correspondence generated at the Foreign Office in London which have not been transferred to the National Archive. This is raising concerns among historians that civil servants in London – as well as colonial officials – may have destroyed key documents.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/7/16/1342452591008/Group-of-people-detained--003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/16/mau-mau-veterans-secret-documents","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jul/16/mau-mau-veterans-secret-documents","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Olafur Eliasson produces cheap solar lamp for developing countries","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-12T16:48:18Z","sectionId":"artanddesign","id":"artanddesign/2012/jul/12/olafur-eliasson-cheap-solar-lamp","fields":{"body":"<p>In 2003, his swollen, hazy, sodium-coloured sun brooded over the vast volume of the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern.

His latest project, conceived as part of the London 2012 festival, is a solar-powered lamp that he and his engineer partner, Frederik Ottesen, have designed and developed. Plans are already in motion for the lamp to be widely distributed in the developing world, in partnership with NGOs including <a href=\"\" title=\"\">Plan International</a>.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-393018051'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/10/10/1255196620359/Olafur-Eliassons-art-inst-003.jpg' alt='Olafur Eliasson's art installation 'The Weather Project' in the Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern' width='220' height='132' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Eliasson's Weather Project installation in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. Photograph: Dan Chung for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>For the one in five of the world's population who live off the electricity grid, Eliasson hopes that it will change lives, allowing people to read, work and interact at a fraction of the cost, over time, of using kerosene lamps.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.littlesun.com/\" title=\"\">Little Sun</a>, as the lamp is called, has risen out of the ashes of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/apr/12/olafur-eliasson-olympic-art\" title=\"\">Eliasson's Cultural Olympiad project, Take a Deep Breath</a>, which the Olympic Lottery Distributor (OLD) declined to fund after details of the proposal were leaked to a newspaper. The project would have asked participants to inhale and exhale on behalf of a cause or idea, and then capture the thought on a \"breath bubble\" on a website. The \"negative publicity\" showed that the work was \"contentious\", found the OLD's board, according to <a href=\"http://www.olympiclottery2012.org.uk/docs/content/summary_minutes_41st_board.pdf\" title=\"\">its March 2012 minutes</a>, and they \"struggled to justify the £1m sought\".</p><p>Explaining why he had developed a social project, the Berlin-based Danish artist said: \"Art is always interested in society in all kinds of abstract ways, though this has a very explicit social component. The art world sometimes lives in a closed-off world of art institutions, but I still think there's a lot of work to show that art can deal with social issues very directly.\"</p><p>The fact that the lamp – with its cheery petalled face – had been designed by an artist was important, he said. \"People want beautiful things in their lives; they want something that they can use with pride … everyone wants something that's not just about functionality but also spirituality.\"</p><p>The lamps will also have a life at the Tate, where they will be on sale at a developed-world price of £16.50. And, starting on 28 July, and for every Saturday night until 23 September, the surrealism rooms at Tate Modern will be plunged into darkness after normal opening hours, and visitors invited to visit them by the light of Little Sun lamps. It will be a conscious echo of an act of the artist Man Ray who, at the opening of the seminal International Surrealist Exhibition of 1938 in Paris, supplied visitors with torches to illuminate the artworks. \"It is a way of experiencing having no light,\" said Eliasson, \"but also a way of using the Little Sun to guide yourself, as if it were an eye.\"</p><p>Eliasson and Ottesen have met the initial costs of the lamp themselves, and have developed what they hope will be a successful business model through which the lamps can be sold locally, initially in Kenya, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe, at both a worthwhile profit for local retailers and an affordable sum for consumers. The price to the eventual users in Africa will be around $10 (£6.40). \"If we don't sell 400,000 quite quickly, I will personally lose a lot of money,\" said Ottesen. Revenue raised will be put back into the project to help make it sustainable.</p><p>According to Ottesen, the lamp, during its initial three-year battery life, will give 10 times more light than using a kerosene lamp and at a 10th of the cost. The battery can also be replaced, doubling the lamp's lifetime. Eliasson insists that the lamps are sturdy and should not break: \"You can drop it from a third-floor window and it still works. You can put it through the washing machine – I don't recommend it, but we've tried it – and it still works.\"</p><p>The design incorporates elements that help keep the battery cool and uses the most recently developed LED technology. In order, however, for the lamp to be sufficiently robust to withstand African heat, it is not made from recycled plastic.</p><p>Left in the sun for five hours, it will provide five hours' worth of light. The money saved by families, the duo hope, will help free more time for children to devote to their education.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/7/12/1342111267681/Girl-holding-two-Little-S-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/12/olafur-eliasson-cheap-solar-lamp","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/12/olafur-eliasson-cheap-solar-lamp","sectionName":"Art and design"},{"webTitle":"Food security index: why does the UK have the worst record of Western European countries?","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-10T20:50:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2012/jul/10/food-security-index","fields":{"body":"<p>Today a food security index that ranks individual countries on food affordability, accessibility, availability, nutritional value and safety was <a href=\"http://foodsecurityindex.eiu.com/\">published</a> for the first time.</p><p>A food security index is becoming increasingly important given the growing world population (expected to swell from 7 billion to 9 billion people by 2050) and the potential limits on our ability to provide food in coming years.

Essentially security is measured under three criteria: quality and safty, affordability and availability. The different measures for each criteria are weighted first to neutralise them and then weighted according to the expert panel deciding the significants of each of the measures.  </p><p>The results show that the U.S., Denmark, Norway, France and the Netherlands are the most food-secure countries in the world.</p><p>The five most impoverished nations at the bottom of the Index, indicating they are have extensive food security problems, are Madagascar, Haiti, Burundi, Chad, and Congo.  </p><p>Interestingly the United Kingdom ranks the lowest among the Western European countries assessed in the study.

Having used it as my main machine for the past fortnight, in a few hours' time I'll have to wipe the hard drive, find the cables, and send it back to Apple.</p><p>The world is going to go fuzzy again. Is this what it's like for people who wear glasses when they lose them?</p><p>OK, I'm back on my old machine now - with its standard display resolution of 1280x800 on a 13\" screen. That works out to about 104 pixels per inch.</p><p>Know what? It's pathetic. </p><p>Here's the fact of it: with the \"retina\" display on the \"new iPad\" (aka iPad 3, aka the version released in January of this year), you had to put it side-by-side against another one to see the difference (something Gawker exploited wonderfully by giving people an old one and telling them it was a new one and filming their delight… and then telling them the truth).</p><p>The difference on this display leaps out at you. It shouts at you. \"Retina-optimised\" programs (especially browsers, but text and film and picture editing too) leap out at you, and demonstrate the precision. It has 220 pixel-per-inch precision, and wow, it's really stunning. Pictures on websites can't do it justice, because they're on websites, and those are only 72ppi, typically. Even TV can't really show you.</p><p>So here's what we'll look at...<br /><a href=\"#nomac\">Appearance</a><br /><a href=\"#appearance\">TAG-1</a><br /><a href=\"#flash\">Flash drives: because you're going there anyway</a><br /><a href=\"#processing\">Processing: there's fast, and 'already there'</a><br /><a href=\"#thunderbolt\">Thunderbolt</a><br /><a href=\"#usbthree\">USB 3.0</a><br /><a href=\"#ethernet\">No Ethernet?</a><br /><a href=\"#lights\">No lights?</a><br /><a href=\"#windows\">Good news, Windows users!</a><br /><a href=\"#downsides\">Downsides (there's a few)</a><br /><a href=\"#unfixable\">User-unfixability</a><br /><a href=\"#webready\">Unready web</a><br /><a href=\"#price\">Price</a><br /><a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></p><p>You may have seen the photos and the TV pictures and shrugged. Nothing special, you think. Consider yourself lucky that you haven't used it for any length of time and then reverted to something older. I have. It hurts. Displays with a quarter of the resolution look as if they're smeared with butter. (Or margarine, health fans.)</p><p>Ironically, I can't show you any screenshots demonstrating the difference effectively, because we only do pictures at 72dpi - not the 144dpi that the \"Retina MacBook Pro\" (RMBP from here on) offers. Well, I can contrast how it appears on a browser (Google Chrome) that doesn't take advantage of the RMBP's text rendering, against another browser (Google Chrome Canary - the bleeding-leading edge version of Google Chrome; I found it very solid).</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-392850239'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/7/6/1341589567513/troll-comparison-460.png' alt='Retina MacBook Pro site comparison' width='460' height='199' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Comparing the same site in a \"retina-ready\" browser and one which is not.

(Optimsed one on right.)</figcaption></figure><h2><a name=\"nomac\">No Mac? No problem, for a while</a></h2><p>Now, you might not use a Mac, and have no interest in doing so. Even so, you're likely in the next few years to benefit from Apple's decision to showcase high-resolution screens on its high-end laptops, because there's a high probability that that will first start appearing on more high-end laptops in the Windows world, and then - let's hope - on the cheaper ones.</p><p>But that's not the only way that the RMBP is leading the pack. It's basically a showcase by Apple for all the best things in laptops today. The display is the standout feature (obviously, since it's what you deal with), but that's not the only thing that's attractive about this machine. </p><h2><a name=\"appearance\">Appearance</a></h2><p>In terms of thickness, it's nearer to the MacBook Air (and \"true\" ultrabooks, hard though those are to find) than the MacBook Pro. In heft, it's not significantly heavier (2.02kg, 4.46lb) than an older MacBook (2.99kg). Again, it's in between the \"standard\" MacBook Pro laptop and the MacBook Air (1.35kg).</p><p>The 15in screen, though, is bigger than you can get on a MacBook Air (only 11in and 13in there). And when you open the lid, the screen seems to fill the entire space; the glass reaches to the edges, and though the bezel is obvious once it's illuminated, the feeling of being immersed in the screen is very powerful. It's also bright. </p><p>Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, introduced it to an eager room of developers at WWDC in June by saying that the company had tried to imagine an \"ultimate\" machine, the sort of thing that will be commonplace in the future. That turns out to mean Flash drives only (not even an option of a spinning drive), no DVD drive, Thunderbolt and USB 3.0 connectors, an SD card slot, surprisingly powerful (and bassy) speakers. And that display. \"The pixels are so small you can't distinguish the individual pixels,\" he said. \"It's the world's highest-resolution notebook display.\"</p><h2><a name=\"flash\">Flash. Because you're going that way anyway</a></h2><p>Flash drives are what you'll have in your computer in five years or so. Per-gigabyte prices are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/jun/22/ssd-prices-fall\">dropping precipitously, while those of hard drives have actually risen</a> over the past year because of last year's floods in Thailand. Apple offers three configurations - 256GB, 512GB, and 768GB. It also says that the throughput is three times faster; I asked whether this was due to its (rumoured, but pretty much confirmed) purchase of Israel's Anobit last year. As is the Apple way, I got a blank stare, rather like someone who'd just had their memories wiped in Men In Black; they wouldn't say. It seems a good bet, though. </p><h2><a name=\"processing\">Processing: there's fast, and there's already there</a></h2><p>I never managed to stress the machine; the Ivy Bridge CPU and NVidia GeForce GT 650M graphics card simply laughed at my simple text ways. Really it's built for heavy-duty pixel-pushing such as video editing, and I did demonstration machines simultaneously running four HD video streams, and switching between them. If you wanted to do real-time editing in the field, this would be the machine to do it on. The fact that it also uses a Flash drive means you'll get a far faster throughput. </p><h2><a name=\"thunderbolt\">Thunderbolt</a></h2><p>Other laptop manufacturers have been reluctant so far to adopt Intel's Thunderbolt technology, which allows you to chain displays and hard drives together - rather like Apple's proprietary Firewire did (with hard drives and disc burners). It has a throughput of up to 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) and can drive multiple displays. </p><h2><a name=\"usbthree\">USB 3.0</a></h2><p>Finally, Apple is offering this. (It's now also on its lower-end MacBook Pro models.) Nice to have caught up with the Windows fraternity - or majority. Apple seems to have ignored USB 3.0 so that it could focus on Thunderbolt. Now the latter is settled, it's catching up elsewhere.</p><h2><a name=\"ethernet\">No Ethernet</a></h2><p>Wired connections are a thing of the past, apparently, or should be. You can buy a Thunderbolt-Ethernet adaptor/connector, but the idea that you'd connect your professional-class laptop to a wired Ethernet is apparently too retro. Ethernet jacks are too fat and old; only slim Thunderbolt jacks (able to shift up to 10Gbp/s, mind you) count here.</p><h2><a name=\"lights\">No lights</a></h2><p>There are no lights on this machine. Since about 1999, Apple laptops have had a little light on the front which, when the lid is closed, indicate whether it is \"sleeping\" (in the Suspend state) by pulsing slowly. If there's no light, the machine's off. </p><p>Here, though, no lights. (OK, there is a light on the power cord connector, to indicate whether the machine is charged or charging.) The assumption seems to be that you'll always put it to sleep, and it will never run out of battery before being reconnected to a power point. Apple suggests it'll get up to <em>30 days</em> standby time. </p><p>The lack of a light makes no difference to everyday use - unlike spinning drive machines, where you needed to wait for the drive to spin down before moving it (in case you caused a head crash), Flash drives don't care about movement, so you can shut the lid and the \"suspend state\" data gets written whether or not the machine is moving.</p><p>This difference is really interesting, especially when you compare it to many Windows laptops, which have blue lights, green lights, red lights - it's like the Las Vegas strip once the hard drive gets working. Perhaps we needed reassurance that the hard drive hadn't died in the old days, hence the lights. Now, it's lights-out.</p><h2><a name=\"windows\">Good news, Windows users!</a></h2><p>Although you can install Windows 8 on this device, and it will run perfectly well, and the Windows 8 elements will be sharp, the text itself doesn't get the fine-grained sub-pixel rendering, according to PC Pro, who have been trying it out. </p><p>But, equally, now that Apple has shown the way it's very likely that other PC manufacturers will follow, and try to push high-end machines with these capabilities. If they want to keep any clients in the photographic business they will, because once any of those use one of these for any period, they'll not go back to a normal screen. </p><p>Well, it worked (eventually) with the MacBook Air, imitations of which (with Flash drives) are busting out all over in the form of ultrabooks. High-res displays are sure to follow as manufacture gets cheaper.</p><h2><a name=\"downsides\">Downsides: there's a few</a></h2><p>If you're buying this machine and you haven't yet got Thunderbolt, you'll need to buy new display adaptors. If you've got an old MacBook laptop which uses the MagSafe connector (it attaches using magnets, rather than a socket, so if the power cord gets yanked nothing gets harmed), you won't destroy the computer.</p><p> • <strong><a name=\"unfixable\">User-unfixability</a></strong>. This is the big one, actually. You can't upgrade the RAM because it's fixed in place, so buy the maximum you can bear. You can't swap the battery, because it's almost moulded into place. Over at iFixit, Kyle Wiens has <a href=\"http://feeds.ifixit.com/~r/ifixit/blog/~3/Xl4qlWTRT_M/\">written at length about this</a> - and not just as a critique of the machine itself, but of the <a href=\"http://feeds.ifixit.com/~r/ifixit/blog/~3/e5VVdRSLPXU/\">general trend towards unfixable appliance-ness</a>, which he says is \"leading humanity down a perilous path\". You can think that he's being hyperbolic, but I agree with him. We've got plenty of landfill, and too much of it taken with gizmos sealed so tight they can't be recycled without melting them down - which uses energy we should be sparing.</p><p>Suggesting that Wiens is just trying to preserve his third-party repair business falls, to me, is to miss the point. Computers don't always go wrong in times and places where you have the time, money or transport to get them to an Authorised Apple Repair Centre. These laptops are intended to be used by video editors in the field (as their processor punch indicates). Hell, what if a cat knocks your drink over your keyboard? And what if that happens while you're in the bush in Kenya making a documentary? </p><p>We can hope that the SSD won't go wrong - but are we sure? SSDs can fail suddenly. When travelling, I carry a backup drive and the tools to fit it (thankfully minimal on the four-year-old MacBook I use) <em>just in case</em>. Laptops have never been easy to repair, but Apple did seem for a while to be heading towards standard connectors and fittings. No more.</p><p>One could discuss whether the trend towards non-fixability is a reflection of our modern consumer society to become appliance-fixated, ignoring what happens to products after they've fulfilled their usefulness to us. But that's probably one for another time.</p><p>• <strong>Battery life</strong>. Apple claims seven hours. Well, there are lies, damned lies, and battery lives. I didn't do a strict \"let's see how long we can string it out\" challenge; I simply used it with Wi-Fi running, and usually got battery lives of up to three hours. That's with a lot of applications (and Wi-Fi) running; quitting applications, turning the screen down and turning off Wi-Fi all increase the potential life. Three or so hours isn't terrible, but we still haven't reached the era when a computer will last all day. (It's those damn display pixels sucking up juice.)</p><p>• <strong><a name=\"webready\">Web ain't ready for it</a></strong>. Especially for the photographers who will be oohing and aaahing over this, visiting many websites will incur the feeling web designers get when you say \"Hey, can we have a blinking sign that says 'Enter' on the home page of our website?\" Most sites aren't doing 144dpi pictures, and likely won't be for some time; all the \"legacy web\" (ie everything pretty much up to this point) is going to be in grotty old 72dpi. I'm not sure much of it will ever get updated to a DPI requiring four times as much storage. </p><p>Equally, the pleasure of using something that renders text so well is huge. (And Google will roll the text-rendering part of Canary into its main Chrome line in time, if that's your main browser; Safari already does. Firefox… well, that's not clear.) </p><p>• <strong><a name=\"price\">Price</a></strong>. Well, yes, this stuff doesn't come cheap. In the UK, the <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_pro/select\">starting price</a> is £1,799 (15in screen, 8GB, 256GB Flash, 2.3GHz processor) while that for the non-retina, non-Flash 15in screen version is £1,499 - although for 8GB RAM and 750GB of spinning storage you'll pay £1,799. Frankly, you'd do better with the RetinaBook.</p><p>It's that combination of price and user-unfixability (especially the latter) that really takes the star off. Mostly, the unfixability. Say all you like about how it's modular and great and how car engines all look like one single moulded piece of plastic when you open the bonnet - but this is meant to be for professionals. They have problems in the field, and they made need to solve them there.</p><h2><a name=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</a></h2><p>It's an amazing machine, and it's got every technology you're likely to need, and a screen to die for, and a price to gulp at. </p><p>Personally, my heart says yes. My head says no - apart from my eyes, which say definitely, absolutely yes. My insurance broker says no. </p><p>I guess I'll get a piggybank and start saving.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/7/6/1341582724855/Apple-MacBook-Pro-001.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/jul/06/apple-retina-macbook-pro-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2012/jul/06/apple-retina-macbook-pro-review","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Army cuts: how have UK armed forces personnel numbers changed over time?","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-05T12:17:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/sep/01/military-service-personnel-total","fields":{"body":"<p>The British army is facing huge cuts, in the latest round of spending details. <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/263D5F71-30CE-45BC-9442-398B1DC12C93/0/futurereserves_2020.pdf\">This report, from the MoD</a>, talks about cuts of 20,000 in regular forces.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/05/thousands-soldiers-compulsory-redundancy\">Nick Hopkins writes today</a> that</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>With the army needing to axe 20,000 posts because of budget cuts, commanders are pushing to downsize as quickly as possible rather than prolong the process.

Early reports suggested a price of £800m for the business although a recent poll by Swedish news agency SME Direkt came up with an average price of £635m and a high of £770m. Credit Suisse analysts said the deal could be financed mainly with debt, along with a placing to raise 25% of the price, and could add around 3% to 2012 earnings.</p><p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished down 3.26 points at 5684.47, but there was little real activity. A disappointing set of UK service sector figures did little to inspire enthusiasm ahead of Thursday's central bank decisions. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p><p><blockquote>Volumes were thin today and the market drifted sideways not only because the US markets were closed for Independence Day, but also because many people were glued to their televisions watching Bob Diamond's testimony to the Treasury Select Committee.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Diamond's testimony had little overall effect on <strong>Barclays </strong>shares, apart from a brief spike higher after the first hour or so. They closed down 1.05p at 166p.</p><p>Elsewhere merger partners <strong>Glencore</strong> and <strong>Xstrata</strong> recovered after recent falls on concerns about whether the deal would be approved by shareholders. Glencore rose 8.3p to 312.05p and Xstrata added 14.4p to 820.8p.</p><p>But <strong>Tesco</strong> fell 3.8p to 315.95p after analysts said the supermarket's prices were too expensive compared to rivals. ING said:</p><p><blockquote>We believe measures taken in the UK are not enough to put Tesco back on track to ensure top-of-the-pack like for like growth and potential market share gains. We think the real problem of the price gap with Asda has still to be properly addressed. In our view, Tesco needs to undertake deeper and broader price cuts to boost volumes. While this may be an unpopular decision in the short term, we believe it will pay off longer term. As such, we downgrade our rating to sell (from Hold) and cut our target price from 320p to 285p.  </blockquote></p><p></p><p>Chip designer <strong>Arm</strong> lost 5p to 512p on renewed concerns about competition from Intel. In a sell note, Janardan Menon at Liberum Capital cut his target price from 500p to 440p and said:</p><p><blockquote>Power consumption and performance of the Intel and Arm architectures are currently similar for smartphones, with Intel having a process technology advantage until 2014. We, therefore, expect Intel to steadily take share from Arm in smartphones and tablets in coming years. Arm is also expected to take share from Intel in the notebook and server segments, but at a slower rate than Intel's smartphone gains till 2014-15. Arm's share price remains expensive compared to its medium and longer term outlook. </blockquote></p><p></p><p><strong>Tullow Oil</strong> was 29p lower at £15.02 on profit taking after a trading update, which showed a record first half revenue of $1.15bn. Investec issued a hold recommendation, saying:</p><p><blockquote>An inline trading statement. Clearly, the Kenya play (worth 150p a share, we think) has been a major first half positive, but offset by disappointments in west Africa. Whilst the exploration outlook is promising, Tullow prices in around $6bn or almost 500p of drillbit upside over the next 18 months.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Canaccord Genuity said:</p><p><blockquote>Although production guidance has not been reduced, we retain concerns about production for 2012. Balancing this, Tullow is entering an exciting exploration period in Kenya, French Guiana and Guyana, which given its track record has the potential to add resources.</blockquote></p><p></p><p><strong>Imperial Tobacco </strong>edged up 1p to £25.65 ahead of a new round of price rises, adding 25p a packet with effect from 10 July. This comes on top of the 37p budget increase. Analysts at Societe Generale said it was an unusually large rise from the company, a significant step-up from last September's 14p rise led by Japan Tobacco.</p><p>Soc Gen said the move would add 4% inflation on an average retail price of 680p a pack, which could put off more smokers. UK cigarette market volumes since the budget have slipped by around 5% to 6%, and Soc Gen estimated this could worsen by another 1% or so.</p><p>But overall the move could boost Imperial's UK profits, analyst Chas Manso said, by around 5% and its group profit by 1%, if the new price increases stuck.</p><p></p><p>Hedge fund group <strong>Man</strong> closed 3.3p lower at 67.55p after JP Morgan Cazenove cut its price target from 100p to 45p:</p><p><blockquote>[Key fund] AHL's investment performance in the second quarter has again been disappointing, requiring us to further reduce our earnings estimates. Our EPS estimate for the current year falls to 5c from 9c. While in percentage terms the decline is clearly material, in large part this reflects just the decline in absolute levels of profitability, with the reduction in the current year equivalent to approximately $80m. That said, we have also now reduced our dividend expectations for 2013 to reflect much lower expected income.<br /><br />Once again it appears that earnings expectations have reduced to fully match the lower share price, leaving the stock no cheaper than it was at considerably higher levels.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Debt laden insurer <strong>Phoenix</strong>, which ended bid talks in February with CVC Capital, jumped 13.4p to 489.3p on renewed talk it could be a takeover target. Analyst Matthew Preston at Berenberg said:</p><p><blockquote>We believe that one of two catalysts will materialise during the remainder of 2012 – either Phoenix will refinance its debt, or it will once again step into the limelight as a bid target. It has minimal exposure to eurozone risks, a dividend yield of around 9% and two potential catalysts looming on the horizon. We upgrade Phoenix to buy from hold, retaining our 695p price target.</blockquote></p><p></p><p><strong>Halfords</strong> was one of the day's biggest fallers, leading the FTSE 250 midcap index lower with a near 9% decline.</p><p>The car parts and bicycle retailer lost 20.4p to 208p. Around 14p of this is attributed to the company's shares going ex-dividend, but it has not been helped by a couple of analyst downgrades ahead of a trading update later this month.</p><p>Just days after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/jul/02/ftse-disappointing-data-soco-vietnam?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Panmure Gordon cut its rating from buy to hold</a>, both Seymour Pierce and Barclays (yes, business goes on as usual at the bank despite liborgate) have become more negative, partly due to the recent poor weather. Kate Calvert at Seymour said:</p><p><blockquote>We have revisited our Halfords forecast in light of competitor discounting and the recent negative weather impact on trading. We expect first quarter UK retail like for like sales to be down 6% when the company updates the market on 19 July. In addition, we have reassessed the cost base as we believe more investment is needed in staff and service. Consequently, we have cut our 2013 pretax profit estimate by 15% to £70m, 2014 profits by 18% to £71.3m.<br /><br />The key concern for the equity story is whether Halfords is experiencing cyclical or structural decline. We believe the business faces maturity issues and has enjoyed supernormal profits over the last two years, benefiting from advantageous product trends and 'staycation' shopping habits. We also feel management has historically squeezed the cost base too hard to try and meet expectations. Unless an improvement in trading occurs soon, we expect change to happen either from corporate activity or within management.<br /></blockquote></p><p>At Barclays, Christodoulos Chaviaras cut its price target from 385p to 350p, although it kept its overweight rating.</p><p>Housebuilder <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong> came under pressure, slipped 1.26p to 48p on concerns about the outlook for the UK housing market.</p><p>The company said the market remained stable in the first half, despite the uncertainty in the eurozone and the rest of the global economy. It sold 5083 homes, up from 4707 the same time last year, with average selling prices up from £168,000 to £175,000.</p><p>Mortgage lending continues to be restricted, although the company said it was encouraged by the introduction of the NewBuy scheme.</p><p>But Robin Hardy at Peel Hunt said:</p><p><blockquote>While the statement points to improving metrics for the first half, the tone is a little less upbeat than we have seen here earlier in the year and elsewhere in the sector.<br /><br />The wider housing market remains soft with mortgage approvals still very materially below any kind of norm and while there is apparently stability in pricing it is something of false image with the distortion from London. National house builders including Taylor Wimpey do not really benefit from this and we still see a long slow deflation in selling prices.</blockquote></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/jul/04/ftse-dow-diamond-gkn","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/jul/04/ftse-dow-diamond-gkn","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"IT entrepreneurs find surprise success in Kenya's Dadaab refugee camps","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-04T12:38:45Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2012/jul/04/entrepreneurs-kenya-dadaab-refugee-camps","fields":{"body":"<p>Mohammed Bashir Sheik was four when he arrived at Dadaab refugee camp with his mother and sister 18 years ago. The family, along with tens of thousands of others, had fled the civil war in Somalia, looking for refuge over the border in north-east Kenya. His mother died when he was 14 and he grew up in the care of his sister.</p><p></p><p>\"Survival in the camp was particularly tough after my mother died. The ration of 6kg of maize, 300g of oil and 400g of beans to last each person for 15 days was hardly enough,\" he recalls.</p><p></p><p>So far, Sheik's story chimes with the typical picture of a refugee. But that is where it ends. Meet Sheik aged 22. He has never left Dadaab, the world's largest refugee complex, but that has not stopped him learning how to create and host websites, set up a small business and teach others how to use computers.</p><p></p><p>When he is not out interviewing people for a newspaper produced in the camp, he can usually be found in the Hag youth information and communications technology (ICT) laboratory, in a corner of Ifo2 camp, an extension of Hagadera, one of the three camps that make up the sprawling Dadaab complex.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two girls clad in <em>buibui</em> (the black shawl Muslim women wear to cover their heads) type on a mobile phone as they engage with friends on Facebook. The scene could be straight from downtown Nairobi, east Africa's ICT hub, except that this camp is 500km from the capital. The nearest town, Garissa, is 120km away – a three-hour journey on off-track roads. Visitors driving to the camp are asked to hire armed security guards for the final leg from Garissa, to ward off possible attacks from the Islamist al-Shabaab insurgency.</p><p></p><p>But for now worries are banished as three young boys tap happily on the keyboard while Sheik teaches them how to navigate the computer. The lab is the culmination of his passion for technology. He learned how to use computers through mobile clinics brought to the camps' schools by NGOs. Unable to study beyond form four (the final year of secondary school), Sheik found computers offered him access to further education.</p><p></p><p>He learned fluent English by chatting online, and friends he made across the world taught him further computer skills. One friend from Australia taught him basics via Skype. \"It's funny that I have not met my friend in person,\" he says.</p><p></p><p>A visiting journalist suggested that Sheik get a dotcom domain to enable him to design websites and earn a living. His clients have included community groups, schools and international organisations.</p><p></p><p>\"I borrowed $300 from a friend to buy a domain from a US-based company and was soon in business,\" he says. For web design he earns about $800 per project, while web hosting can bring in up to $300 per month. He receives this in cash, usually through third parties such as community leaders and NGOs. He has also set up a shop in a makeshift canteen in the camp, where he sells groceries and stationery.</p><p></p><p>Computers have given Sheik – now a father of four – a means to support himself and his family. Now, he is passing on these 21st-century survival skills to the next generation. \"I'm happy today that my life is testimony to how knowledge can transform whole communities not just individuals,\" he says.</p><p></p><p>Sheik set up the internet hub two years ago with friends after a Danish NGO invited youth groups in the camp to submit business proposals, with a $12,000 prize for the best one. \"Ours was the winning proposal, and we decided to invest the money in the project to help young people acquire computer skills.\"</p><p></p><p>The UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), which manages the complex, set up the first camps in 1991 and 1992 following the civil war in Somalia. The camp was meant to host 90,000 refugees. Today, more than 463,000 people live there, including around 10,000 third-generation refugees. The situation is exacerbated by the civil strife in Somalia and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13944550\" title=\"\">the worst drought in the horn of Africa in 60 years</a>, which has led to more refugees pouring into the camp to escape chronic food shortages.</p><p></p><p>Kenyan politicians have been calling for refugees to be repatriated and the camps to be closed, saying Dadaab and others are a drain on the economy. Yet a 2010 study commissioned by the Kenyan, Danish and Norwegian governments claims the Dadaab camps bring about $14m into the community each year, partly through sales of livestock, milk and other goods to the camps. Dadaab generates an annual turnover of around $25m in refugee-run businesses.</p><p></p><p>Sheik's example shows how refugees can boost the Kenyan economy rather than acting as a drain. \"The refugees' human capital is immense,\" says Dominik Bartsch, the UNHCR's head of operations in Dadaab. \"The fact that the majority of the refugees now owe their allegiance to Kenya more than Somalia should be a motivation for the authorities to institute structures to enable the country to tap into the refugees' potential for development.\"</p><p></p><p>However, because of Kenyan labour laws, refugees like Sheik cannot hold permanent jobs. He can only earn basic wages – \"incentives\", rather than salaries, paid to refugees with professional skills who cannot legally work in Kenya. The amounts range from between 2,500 Kenyan shillings ($30) to KSh5,000 per month, paid mainly in cash. Since the refugees do not have permanent identification documents, it is impossible for them to open bank accounts. Neither can refugees travel. There is a strict curfew every evening and refugees can only leave the camps with special passes. Anyone caught without a pass can face arrest, detention or expulsion.</p><p></p><p>\"It seems quite unfair that I should be treated this way in a country that I consider as my second home. It is as though I am being made to pay for the sins I did not commit, by being isolated,\" Sheik says. The refugees feel like second-class citizens, unable to contribute fully to the economy or to create their own future beyond the camps, and it can leave a bitter taste in their mouths.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/6/26/1340705764009/MDG--Dadaab-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/04/entrepreneurs-kenya-dadaab-refugee-camps","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/jul/04/entrepreneurs-kenya-dadaab-refugee-camps","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Healthcare spending around the world, country by country","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-30T15:20:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2012/jun/30/healthcare-spending-world-country","fields":{"body":"<p>How do we fund our healthcare? As the US reacts to the latest supreme court ruling on President Obama's proposals, and the media's attention turns to how individual states will enforce the new proposals, we thought it would be interesting to take a step back and see how the US compares to other countries across the world.</p><p>The US system of health insurance for those who can afford it and state aid for those who can't is very different to the UK's National Health Service - which nonetheless has a strong reliance on private healthcare. In turn, compare this to Cuba, which has some of the highest of spending in the world, compared to its economic size.</p><p>But who spends the most? We took these statistics from the World Health Organisation, which measure spending and medical infrastructure in nearly 200 countries across the globe. They how huge variations in health funding, depending on where you live, although for most countries, people have to pay for healthcare direct. </p><p>The data shows that </p><p>• The US has the highest health spending in the world - equivalent to 17.9% of its gross domestic product (GDP), or $8,362 per person. And it's not all private - government spending is at $4,437 per person, only behind Luxembourg, Monaco and Norway</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>• Under half of all US health spending is by private companies - 46.9%. But it has the highest rate for health insurance in the world - 67.8% of all private spending. Which means the rest comes from out of pocket expenses, ie paying for health as you go</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>• In many countries 'pay as you go' health care is all that's available. Some of them are very poor, such as Congo or Eritrea<br />• Cuba has some of the highest government health spending in the world - 91.5% of all health spending. The result is 67.23 doctors per 10,000 population, the highest of any major country<br />• But it's beaten by the UK on nurses - it has 101 per 10,000 people, only behind countries like Norway and Germany. The UK also spends $3,480 per year on health - 9.6% of health spending - with government spending making up 83.9% of all health spending<br />• Qatar has the lowest health spending in the world, 1.8% of GDP, followed by Burma (Myanmar) and Pakistan at 2.2%. The WHO says Burma's government spends only $4 per person on healthcare</p><p>What would make this data even more interesting is mashing it up with health outcomes, to get some sense of which approach is most effective.

But to no avail. He learned the hard way how poor farmers are risk averse for a good reason. Crop failure for farmers is not merely a financial setback but a disaster that could push families into abject poverty.</p><p></p><p>\"The risk architecture is fundamentally different for these poor farmers and their behaviour was completely rational,\" Kuper said in a recent interview in London. \"The idea of creating springboards for such people, where micro effects could have big differences became an obsession for me.\"</p><p></p><p>Kuper's experience in Rajasthan 14 years ago planted the seed for the idea to replicate for microinsurance what Muhammad Yunus and Fazle Abed did for microcredit at <a href=\"http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=114\" title=\"\">Grameen Bank</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jun/14/bangladesh-brac-aid-uk-australia?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Brac</a> – a Bangladeshi NGO – respectively. Kuper founded LeapFrog in 2007 to provide insurance for \"millions of people who lie awake at night fearing they will lose everything in the event of a fire or flood or other adverse event\". It sought to raise $100m but managed to attract $135m from the likes of the Soros Economic Development Fund, the US pension fund Tiaa-Cref, the investment bank JP Morgan, and the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private-sector finance arm.</p><p></p><p>LeapFrog, which describes itself as a \"profit with purpose\" company, is not in the microinsurance business itself, but invests in those that are, such as <a href=\"http://www.shriram.com\" title=\"\">Shriram</a>, an Indian financial services company that offers life insurance to people with an average annual income of $2,500. The company is reaching people whom other financial services groups have not reached.</p><p></p><p>According to Kuper, 98% of Shriram's customers acquired financial services for the first time. In two years, Kuper said, LeapFrog's investments have allowed 8.7 million people to obtain microinsurance, 6.5 million of whom have a low income, including 5 million women and children. \"That is unprecedented, there is no way that NGOs can reach that number,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Asked about companies that sell dubious financial products – mis-selling of financial products in the UK has been a recurring problem – Kuper says he is aware of the pitfalls. He stressed that LeapFrog looks for companies selling products that are relevant, affordable, transparent and good quality.</p><p></p><p>\"There are bad, unscrupulous players taking advantage of the poor with policies of bad quality,\" he said. \"We find the quality and values-based players. We pick the good ones, and we want the good ones to win … we don't want to invest in companies that offer a funeral policy that takes two months to pay.\"</p><p></p><p>LeapFrog has entered the microinsurance business at a time when insurance companies also see opportunities in a hitherto untapped market. According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the <a href=\"http://www.munichre-foundation.org/StiftungsWebsite/\" title=\"\">Munich Re Foundation</a>, at least <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/press-and-media-centre/news/WCMS_177356/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">33 of the 50 largest commercial insurance companies in the world now offer microinsurance, up from only seven in 2005</a>.</p><p></p><p>The ILO estimates the number of people covered by microinsurance has increased almost 6.5 fold in five years, reaching nearly 500 million worldwide, with China and India leading the charge. The ILO says 60% of the people around the world who are covered by microinsurance live in India, followed by Latin America (15%) and Africa (5%).</p><p></p><p>Africa is a small but growing market for companies such as <a href=\"http://kilimosalama.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Kilimo Salama</a>. Based in Nairobi, Kenya, the microinsurance firm offers products for smallholder farmers. When Kilimo Salama made a payout of $309 two years ago in Embu, near Mount Kenya, the 100 farmers who had gathered in a field were incredulous when their mobile phones started ringing as their electronic payments came through. \"It was a big deal for us, as these farmers realised we were for real,\" said Rose Goslinga, co-founder of Kilimo Salama (Swahili for \"safe farming\").</p><p></p><p>Goslinga and a colleague, Wairimu Muthike, were in London recently where they won the <a href=\"http://www.ftconferences.com/sustainablefinance\" title=\"\">Financial Times award for technology in sustainable finance</a>. Kilimo Salama offers pay-as-you-plant insurance for Kenyan farmers to insure their inputs against drought and excess rain. The programme – a partnership between the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture, UAP Insurance and Safaricom – uses a low-cost mobile phone payment and data system linked to solar-powered weather stations to issue insurance policies. It compensates farmers for investments in seeds, fertiliser and other inputs that are lost due to insufficient or excessive rains. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/oct/26/kenyan-herders-reap-dividends-livestock-insurance\" title=\"\">Others have introduced similar schemes for livestock</a>.</p><p></p><p>Kilimo Salama, which has just completed one of the largest insurance payouts ever on the continent and has insured nearly 64,000 farmers for the next season, is now looking to expand in Rwanda.</p><p></p><p>George Mukkath, director of programmes at <a href=\"http://www.farmafrica.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Farm Africa</a>, a British NGO, believes microinsurance is a positive development, but is aware of hurdles. First the infrastructure, such as weather stations and software, has to be in place along with the need for data to be collected consistently and in a transparent way.</p><p></p><p>\"You need to collect the data on a daily basis, you need a person to collect the data and feed it into the system, then you have to arrive at a level of compensation. People are looking into cost effective ways of getting microinsurance, but it is not easy to set up,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Mukkath said microinsurance needs a wide base of customers to work. \"You need a certain volume of business for it to be viable, at least 20,000 farmers. That means educating those farmers on the value of insurance,\" he said, adding that government support is essential.</p><p></p><p>\"The government would have to have a policy framework to make all this work, to ensure that the industry is regulated properly and those that are selling financial products are not misleading customers. That is even more important in a developing country.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/6/28/1340879600816/TOPSHOTS-Indian-farmers-s-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/29/microinsurance-stable-future-small-scale-farmers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/jun/29/microinsurance-stable-future-small-scale-farmers","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Hewlett Packard: using IT to help revolutionise healthcare in Kenya","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-26T10:40:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/hewlett-packard-it-healthcare-kenya","fields":{"body":"<p>Computer science students at Strathmore University in Nairobi have developed coding for a database giving health workers online access to lab results for infants who have been tested for HIV.</p><p>The university is a partner in a project that has used information technology to revolutionise healthcare provision in Kenya. Instead of the many months it previously took for blood specimens to travel from a rural health clinic to government laboratories for testing, then for the paper results to go back out to the rural clinic before any treatment could begin, the process now takes less than 30 days.</p><p>Since the mortality rate for babies with HIV who remain untreated is 50%, many lives are being saved.</p><p>Paul Ellingstad, who works on social innovation at global technology company Hewlett-Packard, is proud of the <a href=\"http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/social-innovation/kenya.html\" title=\"\">Early Infant Diagnosis project</a>, to which HP has contributed five state of the art data centres, giving the Kenyan government a modern IT infrastructure for the first time. As a measure of its success, the programme is being replicated by the ministry of health in Uganda and another project is starting in Nigeria.</p><p>\"Technology isn't a silver bullet, but it is a key enabler that allows the government to have transparency of information so better decisions can be made and you can see better health outcomes,\" Ellingstad says.</p><p>This is the new face of corporate social responsibility, something HP calls \"social innovation\" stemming from Michael Porter and Mark Kramer's work on shared value: the move by companies to try to align their own growth with meeting societal needs.</p><p>In a survey of senior corporate managers last year, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbesinsights/philanthropy_csr_2011/index.html\" title=\"\">Forbes Insights found</a> that almost 80% agreed with the statement that \"demonstrating our social purpose is crucial to shareholder value\". HP points out that companies have a responsibility to be a force for social good. Of the world's 100 largest \"economies\", 51 are corporations.</p><p>The $51.5m (£32.8m) HP spent on social programmes last year has to be seen in the context of the $32bn in revenues it made in the latest quarter.</p><p>But is it really possible for any company, whose raison d'être is to make money for its investors and shareholders sitting in far off western boardrooms, to act for the greater social good in a country such as Kenya?</p><p>Ellingstad, who has just gained the new title of partnership and programme development director in HP's office of global social innovation, says it is possible, provided that companies closely focus their efforts, and work collaboratively. In the Early Infant Diagnosis project, HP is working with the <a href=\"http://www.clintonfoundation.org/what-we-do/clinton-health-access-initiative\" title=\"\">Clinton Health Access Initiative</a> (Chai), Swiss pharmaceuticals company <a href=\"http://www.roche.co.uk/portal/uk\" title=\"\">Roche</a>, local mobile phone network operator <a href=\"http://safaricom.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Safaricom</a>, the university and, critically, the health ministry.</p><p>\"Many times NGOs and private sector organisations, with the best of intentions, take a unilateral approach and parachute in a Swat team to try to solve a problem,\" says Ellingstad. \"We believe that when you are talking about health and education, the government needs to be at the centre of any ecosystem of partners.\"</p><p>While unilateral action is far quicker than collaboration, it is much less effective, Ellingstad says, \"We are more interested in long-term outcomes and sustainable progress. There's an African saying: 'If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go further, go together.\"</p><p>HP is working with Chai, and government health departments on other projects in Africa and Asia. It has created a cloud computing infrastructure in Nigeria and Ghana to allow people using basic mobile phones to find out whether the drug they are about to buy, most commonly to prevent malaria, is counterfeit.</p><p>In Botswana, healthcare workers use HP smartphones to send malaria information to a cloud database. They can tag the data with GPS co-ordinates, and issue SMS disease outbreak alerts. Ellingstad says huge leaps in technology have transformed fields like retail, IT and banking over the last 10 years, but health and education have been left behind.</p><p>\"We see that there's a role for technology to fundamentally improve access to health care.\" And the starting point is the mobile phone, to which 5.7 billion people around the world have some access, he says.</p><p>Ellingstad says HP's social programmes have opened up major market opportunities, worth billions of pounds, in countries where HP had previously been known only for its printers.  And they are appreciated by HP's 350,000 employees, who enjoy the \"halo effect\" to the company's reputation, and can even contribute their own skills. The company encourages employees to take up to four hours off a month to work as volunteers in community projects.</p><p>Other programmes use HP technologies to nurture entrepreneurs in developing countries, and to promote the teaching of science, technology, engineering and maths.</p><p>Which brings us back to the students in Strathmore University's computer science department, who, besides developing further applications for Kenya's health ministry, are involved in another HP project: a grid computing network that allows researchers from 20 universities to share computing power.</p><p>Ellingstad says students at Makerere University in Kampala improved on the work of the Kenyan students as they replicated the Early Infant Diagnosis project in Uganda, and fed their innovations back. \"It is,\" says Ellingstad, \"truly a virtuous circle of innovation and development.\"</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

More than 216 million people are infected every year and approximately 655,000 die from malaria, mostly children under five and pregnant women.</p><p>Effective medicines to treat the disease exist. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.novartis.com/\" title=\"\">Novartis</a>, a multinational healthcare company, delivers its antimalarial artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) Coartem® without profit to the public sector of malaria-endemic countries. Since 2001, the company has provided 500 million ACT treatments, impacting more than one million lives.</p><p>A key challenge in the fight against malaria is to ensure medicines reach those who most need them: patients living in remote rural areas with poor access to health services. Yet, stock-outs of medicines at the health facility level are a big and persistent problem in many sub-Saharan countries. Once drugs reach the country and enter the supply chain, there is little or no visibility on what happens. This makes it extremely difficult to manage the supply chain and to anticipate stock-outs of life-saving drugs.</p><p><strong>SMS for Life pilot in rural Tanzania yields positive results</strong></p><p>Using short messaging service (SMS) and mobile mapping technology, a public private partnership called <a href=\"http://malaria.novartis.com/innovation/sms-for-life/index.shtml\" title=\"\">SMS for Life</a> between Novartis, IBM, Vodafone, the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, and the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Tanzania developed and piloted a solution to this problem. The program has now been rolled out countrywide in Tanzania to all 5,097 health facilities with support from Medicines for Malaria Venture and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.</p><p>A 21-week pilot study was undertaken during 2009-2010 in three districts of rural Tanzania, involving 129 health facilities and covering a population of 1.2 million people. It confirmed the effectiveness of the approach in reducing stock-outs for ACTs. Stock data was provided in 95% of cases, and data was very accurate, with an error rate of 7.5%, most of which were corrected.</p><p>At the start of the pilot, 25% of all health facilities had no ACT in stock, but by the end, 95% had at least one ACT dosage form in stock. Furthermore, at the end of the pilot, 300,000 more people than at the beginning had access to ACTs.</p><p>SMS for Life simplifies the process of monitoring the availability of drugs in remote health centres. Vodafone and Greenmash, a UK-based company, are two technology suppliers that provide systems that use SMS to prompt healthcare staff in rural facilities to check the remaining weekly stock of medicines. Health facility workers reply with an SMS to a toll-free number, and are rewarded with free airtime for their responses to weekly stock requests. This information is then stored in a central database. The district management team can monitor stock levels remotely and in real-time via the Internet, a smart phone or e-mail and re-distribute existing medicines or schedule new drug deliveries when and where they are needed.</p><p><strong>Program is now being expanded to Ghana and Kenya </strong></p><p>The SMS for Life process is also now being piloted in Ghana and Kenya, and has expanded beyond malaria medicines, enabling the monitoring of rapid diagnostics tests for malaria, bed nets, antibiotics, leprosy and tuberculosis drugs. In addition, the system is being used in Kenya to collect weekly surveillance data on the total number of patients, total tested, total positive and total treated.</p><p>Authors of a recent article published in the Malaria Journal commented on the potential power of the Kenya implementation: \"It is hoped that in the era of imperfect drug supply, the package of interventions, including intense monitoring with high visibility at all levels of care and adequate local responses, may be sufficient to enable Kenya to eliminate stock-outs and achieve 2013 targets of universal and continuous availability.\" (Sudoi et al.

Within 30 days, between 50,000 and 70,000 people – about 10% of the total refugee population – died of waterborne diseases, cholera and dysentery among them.</p><p></p><p>Those deaths did not need to happen, says Nathan Jones, who works for Hydration Technology Innovations. What those refugees needed was reliable – and immediate – access to clean water, and Jones says his company has the technology that can deliver it.</p><p></p><p>Their invention is called the <a href=\"http://www.htiwater.com/divisions/humanitarian/about.html\" title=\"\">HydroPack</a>, and it has already been used in disaster situations across four continents. When empty, the 4in by 6in pouch looks like a paper-thin bit of plastic, but drop it into a water source – anything from a swimming pool to a rubbish-infested stream – and in eight to 12 hours you'll have 500 millilitres of water that is safe to drink. With its bright colouring and the little straw that comes attached, a swollen HydroPack looks surprisingly like a juice box, minus the glossy packaging.</p><p></p><p>The HydroPack works by forward osmosis, the same process by which plant roots extract water from the ground, and the water that ends up inside exceeds the clean-water guidelines set out by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The packs are fortified with sugar and salt to aid absorption, as well as flavouring to increase the appeal.</p><p></p><p>About 15,000 of the packs, which can be airdropped, were distributed in flood-ravaged western Kenya this year. They were also used in the aftermath of the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile in 2010, as well as after the tsunami in Japan last year.</p><p></p><p>\"It's a real paradigm shift in how you approach that initial phase [of disaster relief],\" says Jones, adding that aid agencies and NGOs have long relied on chemical tablets, or even flown-in bottled water, to provide safe drinking water in emergency situations. \"Bottled water is frequently used, but it comes with a really heavy cost, both financial in terms of the transport of it, but environmentally as well.\"</p><p>The HydroPack is just one of a number of new technologies that are helping the international community sharpen its response to humanitarian emergencies around the world. Jones and other innovators had the chance to sell their products to procurement experts during \"pitch tank\" sessions at the <a href=\"http://www.aidforumonline.org/\" title=\"\">Aid &amp; International Development Forum</a>, which was held last week in Washington.</p><p></p><p>The private sector is key to keeping aid agencies on their toes, says Maura O'Neill, the chief innovation officer at USAid. \"Increasingly, we are co-creating solutions [with private companies] around a big, difficult development problem,\" she says. \"A main part of their business objectives are overlapping increasingly with our development outcomes.\"</p><p></p><p>Other innovations that got an airing include Puralytics, a technology that uses sunlight to purify water, and pop-up greenhouses from a company called Got Produce? Its 300 square metre greenhouses, which double as water purification systems, can produce fruit and vegetables in only 30 days, operating completely off the grid.</p><p></p><p>Gigacrete, a Las Vegas-based company, makes easy-to-construct foam houses that can withstand winds of more than 300km/h, and the Leading Edge Group, which produces a brick-making machine that can churn out nearly a thousand blocks an hour, with clay-bearing dirt as the only input. Losberger, a German company, presented its hi-tech inflatable shelters that can be used to house hospitals in the field.</p><p></p><p>USAid is hoping to promote more of these kinds of advances through its <a href=\"http://idea.usaid.gov/organization/div/overview\" title=\"\">Development Innovation Ventures</a> fund, a government programme that operates like a venture capital fund for new ideas in development. So far, says O'Neill of USAid, the programme has received more than 1,200 applications and funded two-dozen projects, with many more in the pipeline. Any group or individual can apply for a grant, she says, whether they're based in the US or overseas.</p><p></p><p>The fund, which was launched in 2010 and is known as DIV, gave out its first grants last year. DIV divides its grantees into three stages: stage one projects are still in the proof-of-concept phase, and get up to $100,000; stage two projects are ready to scale up across an entire country, and receive up to $1m; while stage three projects are poised to have a multinational impact, and can get as much as $15m over several years.</p><p></p><p>The programme aims to fund \"solutions that are several times more cost effective than current practice\", USAid says on its website, and it is looking for innovations that can quickly be brought to scale: \"We recognise that development breakthroughs can come from anywhere – a lab in a university, a local person who has deep contextual knowledge, or a passionate entrepreneur. Perhaps it will come from you.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/13/1339605199634/Access-to-drinking-water-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jun/15/innovative-aid-drinking-water-polluted-stream","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jun/15/innovative-aid-drinking-water-polluted-stream","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Global peace index 2012: the full list","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-12T11:41:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2012/jun/12/global-peace-index-2012","fields":{"body":"<p>The world has become more peaceful for the first time since 2009 according to the annual <a href=\"http://www.visionofhumanity.org/gpi-data/\">Global Peace Index (GPI)</a> released today. Austerity-driven defence cuts creating gains in several indicators of militarisation and improvements in the Political Terror Scale have lead to changes in the annual rankings.</p><p>Published by the <a href=\"http://www.economicsandpeace.org/\">Institute for Economics &amp; Peace</a>, the index tries to measure peacefulness.

The Middle East is now amongst one of the least peaceful regions in the world, with the drop in rankings for the Arab countries refelecting the turbulence and instability created by the events of the Arab Spring.</p><p>Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Bhutan, Guyana and the Philippines are the top 5 risers on the GPI 2012. Including three of the top five risers, Asia Pacific region's overall score improved by the greatest extent from 2011. Steve Killilea of the IEP says: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Peacefulness has returned to approximately the levels seen in 2007, but while<br />external measures of peacefulness have improved, there has been a rise in internal conflict. This is particularly noticeable in the rise in fatalities from terrorist acts which have more than trebled since 2003.</p></blockquote><p>Now in it's sixth year, the GPI is made up of 23 indicators and ranks 158 countries. It gages the level of safety and security in society and also looks at the extent of domestic or international conflict.</p><p>The indicators range from a nation's level of military expenditure to its relations with neighbouring countries and the level of respect for human rights. The index has been tested against a range of potential \"drivers\" or determinants of peace—including levels of democracy and transparency, education and national wellbeing. </p><p>So what does the 2012 rankings show us? Below are some of the findings:</p><blockquote><p>• Somalia is the least peaceful country at 158th position and with a score of 3.392. Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq and the Democratic Republic of Congo make up the bottom five<br />    • There has been change for the the indicators as well. The top three largest improvements have been for the Political Terror Scale, terrorist acts and military expenditure as a % of GDP<br />    • Iceland has remained at the top spot as most peaceful country in the world, after dropping in the rankings in 2009 and 2010 because of violent demonstrations linked to the collapse of its financial system<br />    • Sub-saharan Africa is no longer the least peaceful region in the world, for the first time since the GPI began</p></blockquote><p><br />The index also finds the monetary value of peace: they estimate that if the world had been completely peaceful in 2011, the additional economic impact would have been an estimated $9tn - equal to the size of Germany and Japan's economies combined.</p><p>We have the data going back to 2007 below. It's one of a number of indicators available, such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/dec/01/corruption-index-2011-transparency-international\">Transparency International's

dreams to drones: who is the real Barack Obama? | Pankaj Mishra","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-04T20:00:03Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2012/jun/04/obama-presidency-cruellest-political-hoax","fields":{"body":"<p>Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/23/barack_oromney\" title=\"\">according to Foreign Policy</a> magazine, \"has become George W Bush on steroids\". Armed with a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">\"kill list\",</a> the Nobel peace laureate now hosts \"Tuesday terror\" meetings at the White House to discuss targets of drone attacks in Pakistan and at least five other countries. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/04/us-drones-attack-pakistan-targets\" title=\"\">latest of these killed 17 people</a> near the border with Afghanistan today .</p><p>Unlike the slacker Bush, who famously disdained specifics, Obama routinely deploys his Ivy League training in law. Many among the dozens of \"suspected militants\" massacred by drones in the last three days in northwestern Pakistan are likely to be innocent. Reports gathered by NGOs and Pakistani media about previous attacks speak of a collateral damage running into hundreds, and deepening anger and hostility to the United States. No matter: in Obama's legally watertight bureaucracy, drone attacks are not publicly acknowledged; or if they have to be, civilian deaths are flatly denied and all the adult dead categorised as \"combatants\".</p><p>Obama himself signed off on one execution knowing it would also kill innocent family members. He has also made it \"legal\" to execute Americans without trial and expanded their secret surveillance, preserved the CIA's renditions programme, violated his promise to close down Guantánamo Bay, and ruthlessly arraigned whistleblowers.</p><p>Not only <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/02/cornel-west-mitt-romney_n_1471061.html\" title=\"\">is Cornel West, Obama's most prominent black intellectual supporter</a>, appalled, but also the apparatchiks of Bush's imperial presidency such as former CIA director Michael Hayden. Perhaps it is time to ask again: who is Barack Obama? And how has Pakistan featured in his worldview? The first question now seems to have been settled too quickly, largely because of the literary power of Obama's speeches and writings. His memoir, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/aug/26/features.review4\" title=\"\">Dreams From My Father</a>, was quickened by the drama of the self-invented man from nowhere – the passionate striving, eloquent self-doubt and ambivalence that western literature, from Stendhal to Naipaul,  has trained us to identify with a refined intellect and soul. Not surprisingly, Obama's careful self-presentation seduced some prominent literary fictionists, inviting comparisons to James Baldwin.</p><p>Later biographies of Obama, published after he became president, have complicated the picture of him as the possessor of diversely sourced identities (Kenya, Indonesia, Hawaii, Harvard). <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/25/barack-obama-the-college-years\" title=\"\">David Maraniss's new biography</a> shows that at college the bright student from&nbsp;Hawaii's closest friends were Pakistanis, and he carried around a dog-eared copy of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Man\" title=\"\">Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man</a>.</p><p>But Obama also began early, as one girlfriend of his reported to her diary, to \"strike out\", \"shedding encumbrances, old images\". \"Do you think I will be president of the United States?\" he asked a slightly bemused Pakistani friend, who then witnessed \"Obama slowly but carefully distancing himself from the Pakistanis as a necessary step in establishing his political identity\".</p><p>\"For years,\" Maraniss writes, \"Obama seemed to share their attitudes as sophisticated outsiders who looked at politics from an international perspective. But to get to where he wanted … he had to change.\" Obama's Pakistani friend recalls: \"The first shift I saw him undertaking was to view himself as an American in a much more fundamental way.\"</p><p>In an incorrigibly rightwing political culture, this obliged Obama to always appear tougher than his white opponents. During his 2008 presidential debates with John McCain, Obama often startled many of us with his threats to expand the war in Afghanistan to Pakistan. More disquietingly, he claimed the imprimatur of Henry Kissinger, who partnered Richard Nixon in the ravaging of Cambodia, paving the way for Pol Pot, while still devastating Vietnam.</p><p>It can't be said Obama didn't prepare us for his murderous spree in Pakistan. It is also true that drone warfare manifests the same pathologies – racial contempt, paranoia, blind faith in technology and the superstition of body counts – that undermined the US in Vietnam.</p><p>The White House has been used before to plot daily mayhem in some obscure, under-reported corner of the world. During the long bombing campaign named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rolling_Thunder\" title=\"\">Rolling Thunder</a>, President Lyndon Johnson personally chose targets in Indochina, believing that <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon3/pent3.htm\" title=\"\">\"carefully calculated doses of force could bring about desirable and predictable responses from Hanoi\"</a>.</p><p>But of course \"force\", as James Baldwin pointed out during Kissinger and Nixon's last desperate assault on Indochina, \"does not reveal to the victim the strength of his adversary. On the contrary, it reveals the weakness, even the panic of his adversary and this revelation invests the victim with patience\".</p><p>The last US personnel in Vietnam had to be evacuated from the roof of the American embassy in Saigon, and this may yet be the fate of the western mission in Afghanistan. The Taliban, it is clear, won't be killed and mutilated into submission. A weak Pakistan, its rulers bribed and bullied into acquiescence, is the easier setting for a display of American firepower. In ways his Pakistani college friends couldn't have foreseen, their country now carries the burden of verifying Obama's extra-American manhood, especially at election time.</p><p>Obama was quick to say sorry to Poland last week for saying <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10265077\" title=\"\">\"Polish death camps\"</a> rather than \"death camps in Poland\" in a speech. But he refuses to apologise for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/23/pakistan-army-rejects-us-findings\" title=\"\">American air strikes that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers in November last year</a>. Widespread public anger has forced Pakistan's government to block Nato's supply routes to Afghanistan; any hint of infirmity on the sensitive issue of sovereignty is likely to strengthen some of the country's nastiest extremists. Thus, the few possibilities of political stability in a battered country are now hostage to Obama's pre-election punitiveness.</p><p>Certainly, Obama's political and personal journey now evokes less uplifting literary comparisons. For, nearly four years after his ecstatically hailed ascension to the White House, Obama resembles Baldwin much less than he does Kipling and other uncertain children of empire who, as Ashis Nandy writes in The Intimate Enemy, replaced their early identifications with the weak&nbsp;with \"an unending search for masculinity and status\". These men saw both their victims and compatriots \"as gullible children who must be impressed with conspicuous machismo\"; and who suppressed their plural selves \"for the sake of an imposed imperial identity – inauthentic and killing in its grandiosity\".</p><p>\"We're killin' 'em! We're killin' 'em all!\" Bush exulted, according to Bob Woodward, during his last months in office. And now another man sits in the White House, surveying his own kill lists&nbsp;and plotting re-election, after having already&nbsp;pulled off the cruellest political hoax of our times.</p><p><em>• Follow Comment is free on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/commentisfree\" title=\"\"><em>@commentisfree</em></a><em> is out in August</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/4/1338832492148/Barack-Obama-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/04/obama-presidency-cruellest-political-hoax","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/04/obama-presidency-cruellest-political-hoax","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Mobile phone boom in developing world could boost e-learning","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-30T10:29:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2012/may/30/mobile-phone-developing-world-elearning","fields":{"body":"<p>Globalisation, as defined by the rich, is a very nice thing, the former US president Jimmy Carter once reflected. \"You're talking about the internet, you're talking about cell phones, you're talking about computers,\" said Carter. \"This doesn't affect two-thirds of the people in the world.\"</p><p>That was in 2001; a lot has changed. In Kenya, mobile phones have become an integral part of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/19/cash-transfers-malnourished-children-kenya\" title=\"\">cash transfer schemes, enabling poor people in urban areas to buy food</a>. In remote rural areas of Peru, computers provided by the <a href=\"http://www.programaeuro-solar.eu/eng/programa_descripcion.php\" title=\"\">Euro-Solar programme</a> are fuelling an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/nov/28/rural-peru-gets-internet-access\" title=\"\">appetite for learning among children</a>.

Quite a lot, according to the authors of a report prepared by the GSMA mobile industry body and published to coincide with last week's <a href=\"http://www.elearning-africa.com/\" title=\"\">eLearning Africa conference in Cotonou, Benin</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/developmentfund/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mLearning_Report_230512_V2.pdf\" title=\"\">Shaping the future – realising the potential of informal learning through mobile</a> (pdf), explores mobile technology's potential to improve access to education for young people in developing countries. The study looks at Ghana, Morocco, Uganda and Maharashtra, in India, identifying young people's aspirations and priorities, exploring the education and employment challenges they face, and scrutinising their mobile phone use.</p><p>The endgame is to establish how the mobile industry and international development community can pool their expertise to create m-learning services that improve teaching and learning, and therefore promote long-term development.</p><p>\"It's a big step in the right direction in terms of putting the possibilities in front of the GSMA's members and raising awareness of the commercial and business opportunities education represents in the developing world,\" says John Traxler, professor of m-learning at the University of Wolverhampton in the UK. \"Clearly it's a small sample, covering only four countries, so it's indicative rather than representative. But if the networks get the message, it's a valuable piece of work. Networks don't need to hear it's virtuous, they need to hear it's profitable – just enough to encourage them to get out there and do something.\"</p><p>Mobile phones are increasingly ubiquitous in poor countries, which now account for <a href=\"https://www.wirelessintelligence.com/print/snapshot/101021.pdf\" title=\"\">four in every five connections worldwide</a> (pdf). As Elsie Kanza, of the World Economic Forum, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/10/africa-changing-for-the-better?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">recently said</a>: \"Regardless of social class, almost everyone [in Africa] has a mobile phone, or two or three. Even in remote villages, mobile phones have replaced the bicycle or radio as prized assets.\"</p><p>An obvious caveat is that voice-calls far outstrip data use in poor countries, which remain an emerging market for smartphones and other data-enabled devices. One reason is cost. A quarter of the young people surveyed – and almost half of those from Ghana – said a shortage of money was the biggest obstacle to accessing educational resources. Even so, the rapid spread of mobile technology offers clear possibilities for learning. Of the young people participating in the study who had accessed the internet, half had done so on a mobile device.</p><p>One female student from rural India told the GSMA researchers: \"In class, I sometimes record the lectures on my phone so I can listen to them later in case I forget or don't understand. I can use the calculator to help me with my maths. My favourite subjects are maths, science, history and economics. If you could get these on your mobile it would be good.\"</p><p>Enthusiasm for learning was a common thread in the feedback. Only family and health were felt to be of greater importance by the study's participants, 30% of whom said having a good career ranked higher among their priorities than marriage or home ownership.</p><p>Despite this aspirational outlook, however, only a quarter said the classroom was their principal source of information and education. Friends and family were identified as more important by 41%, while 43% gleaned most of their knowledge from TV programmes.</p><p>So can m-learning help? Yes, say the report's authors, who suggest that, by using the study's findings to tap into common interests among young mobile users, the reach and impact of educational material can be increased. Many of those surveyed used their devices to access music and sports content (49% and 24% respectively across the four areas studied); by bundling learning material with, say, football updates, the GSMA researchers believe technology can make a significant difference.</p><p>Others, however, are sceptical. Some experts say there is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/mar/13/mobile-learning-research-language-teaching\" title=\"\">little demonstrable evidence of m-learning's impact</a>, suggesting it threatens to undermine traditional teaching methods and – by leaving those without access to devices at a disadvantage – reinforce inequality.</p><p>Traxler believes such arguments are misguided. \"You don't have to pay for mobile technology, and it reaches the people you want to reach,\" he argues. \"Computers, books, television sets and college buildings may be infinitely more respected, but people already have mobile phones – they buy them, pay for them, and carry them. So let's look at how the technology is representative of our society, and how we can use it, rather than worrying about the niceties of education.\"</p><p>The report preaches a message Traxler has long championed, one he hopes will now trickle down not only to mobile networks and their commercial departments, but also to governments. \"That's where the action needs to happen,\" he says. \"We've had 10 years of relatively small-scale, short-term projects, and by their very nature I'm not sure how much they would really have told us, or how rigorous they were.</p><p>\"The case that needs to be made is about sustainability, scale, return on investment and impacting on government policies. If the GSMA can do a better job than the rest of us have done in the past 10 years, then good luck to them – and I think they probably will.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/5/25/1337961366020/MDG--Learning-access-with-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/30/mobile-phone-developing-world-elearning","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/may/30/mobile-phone-developing-world-elearning","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Diamond jubilee in charts: how has Britain changed since Elizabeth took the throne?","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-30T08:00:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2012/may/30/diamond-jubilee-1952-2012-compared","fields":{"body":"<p>What kind of country was Britain in 1952 - and how different was it to the world of 2012?</p><p>As the Queen's diamond jubilee weekend gears up, we thought it would be fun to compare the nation that Elizabeth became queen of with the country she celebrates her diamond jubilee in.</p><p>We've gathered together some disparate but fascinating indicators which give a flavour of Britain in 2012 and the other country that is its past - where they did things very differently.

Reputedly the world's top school for \"modern\" music, it is, as he says, \"an institution established for people who hate institutions\".</p><p>Since 1945, Berklee students have won many top prizes, including 205 Grammy Awards in categories such as pop, rock, jazz and film music. Quincy Jones started here in 1951 with a scholarship, going on to win 27 Grammys. In 2011, shortly after leaving the school, the jazz bassist and singer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/05/espoeranza-spalding-radio-music-review\" title=\"\">Esperanza Spalding</a> won the Grammy for the Best New Artist. She entered the school aged 17 and went on to teach there.</p><p>The college boasts a truly impressive honours board. Former students include Keith Jarrett, Pat Metheny, Branford Marsalis, Diana Krall, Melissa Etheridge, but also Howard Shore, well known for his film scores, and Brad Whitford, the Aerosmith rhythm guitarist.</p><p>The college is close to Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Indeed its founder, Lawrence Berk, was an MIT engineer. His aim in starting the school was to convince elite Boston that popular music, with its strong African-American influences, was far more sophisticated than they thought. It was originally called the Schillinger House of Music and specialised in a system of harmony and composition based on mathematical models by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schillinger\" title=\"\">Joseph Schillinger</a>, a Russian musician who died in 1943. George Gershwin and the clarinettist Benny Goodman studied under him. The college later changed its name to Berklee, a tribute to the founder's son, Lee, who took over from his father in 1979.</p><p>Brown was born in Gainesville, Georgia, in the days of segregation. He led \"the marvellous life of southern kids\" focusing largely on US football. But his mother, unusually for a woman in the south, had played trombone in the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Brown was classically trained, but the local radio station gave him his first taste of pop music.</p><p>The college's third chief executive, Brown has strong connections with Africa. In 1978, having graduated in physics, he went to Kenya to teach maths. \"At the time I hadn't made the connection between the segregationist situation in the southern states and my desire to go there. I understood later,\" he explains. Before he set off for Kenya, he looked for a book to learn Swahili. \"I walked till I reached a bookshop in Harlem called Revolutionary Books. Being white, with a very noticeable southern accent, I was scared stiff. But the man was very friendly.\" Brown went on to play drums in a gospel choir in Kenya and in Gainesville.</p><p>Every year Berklee College presents honorary doctorates to musicians from outside the college. In 2010 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/may/18/angelique-kidjo-review\" title=\"\">Angélique Kidjo</a>, of Benin, received this award \"for her exemplary work for Africa\", Brown explains. The college operates a talent-spotting scheme there that enabled the guitarist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/aug/19/lionel-loueke-mwaliko-cd-review\" title=\"\">Lionel Loueke</a>, among others, to obtain a contract with Blue Note and team up with trumpeter Terence Blanchard.</p><p>The college brings together more than 4,000 students from 80 different countries, under the guidance of 360 teaching staff. \"There are excellent musicians trained in Europe's academies. But at Berklee our aim is not just to prepare them to join a famous orchestra, but also to help them create new musical forms,\" Brown says. His predecessors witnessed the arrival of various revolutions – free jazz, funk, hip-hop – and took them on board.</p><p>It is now up to Brown to cope with the \"tectonic shock\" of the global market, digital music and social networks. \"Young people are growing up in an immaterial world,\" he says. \"They have never been as interested in music as they are now, because they can find it everywhere, on Facebook and in all the media.\" He predicts that technology will bring artists and their audience closer together.</p><p>Brown was in Cannes, France, in January for the <a href=\"http://www.midem.com/\" title=\"\">Midem International Music Market</a>. He announced a brainstorming session to rethink music, held in Boston in April, and the September launch of Berklee College of Music in Valencia, Spain. Until now the college has been involved in partnerships with local schools, reaching from South Korea to Brazil.</p><p>Studying at Berklee is expensive – $33,000 a year – but a large number of students win scholarships or are supported by foundations. The college prides itself on the quality of its amenities, its rehearsal rooms, concert halls, studios and equipment. To keep them up-to-date, part of Brown's job is to find funding; $50m was raised in 2007 alone.</p><p>Students must pass an audition and show exceptional talent, but that does not mean they have to be able read music, \"nor indeed improvise\", Brown adds, for the benefit of those with a classical background. \"When the jazz bassist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/may/06/marcus-miller-cheltenham-jazz-review\" title=\"\">Marcus Miller</a> auditioned he was 18, but they immediately asked if he wanted to study or teach,\" recalls French film-score composer Krishna Levy, who studied at Berklee in 1986-87.</p><p>\"I spent a year experimenting with all the pitfalls of composition. I asked fellow students to play stuff the wrong way round,\" says Levy, who had just emerged from a very academic course. \"I met a teacher, <a href=\"http://www.berklee.edu/bt/192/bb_pomeroy.html\" title=\"\">Herb Pomeroy</a>, a trumpeter who had played with Charlie Parker among others. His big band was amazing. I used to play piano 10 hours a day and listen to hard rock, which I had totally rejected till then.\" The jazz pianist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/aug/12/jacky-terrasson-push-cd-review\" title=\"\">Jacky Terrasson</a> has great memories of his time at Berklee too: \"There was a fantastic spirit of wanting to learn from each other [...] with people from all over the world jamming together.\"</p><p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/5/23/1337770962909/Angelique-Kidjo-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/29/berklee-college-grammy-music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/2012/may/29/berklee-college-grammy-music","sectionName":"Music"},{"webTitle":"FTSE records first weekly rise in a month, while Aviva edges up on disposal talk","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-25T16:28:14Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/marketforceslive/2012/may/25/ftse-weekly-rise-aviva","fields":{"body":"<p>As leading shares recorded a weekly rise for the first time in a month despite the continuing eurozone crisis, City analysts were queuing up to give <strong>Aviva</strong> advice on how to improve its flagging business.</p><p>The insurer parted company with chief executive Andrew Moss in early May after a shareholder rebellion over pay, and the City believes whoever takes over should make some radical moves, including floating some of its overseas businesses or asking shareholders for cash to boost the balance sheet. Analyst Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas said Aviva should package its Asian and European business, including Poland, together and split them off in a flotation which could be worth £2bn. Hughes, who moved his recommendation on Aviva from underperform to outperform with a 331p price target, said:</p><p><blockquote>[A flotation] of the combined businesses would give investors that value growth the opportunity to buy into the asset while allowing Aviva to repair capital buffers with limited impact on cash flows. While we still believe that consensus earnings forecasts are too optimistic and that the dividend will be cut, we also believe the stock is currently too cheap. The share is an attractive purchase going into [its 5 July] investor day, as market expectations appear to be very limited.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Meanwhile Canaccord Genuity issued a buy note on the business although it cut its price target from 410p to 320p. Analyst Ben Cohen suggested a 2 for 5 rights issue at 150p a share as one way of strengthening its capital base, as well as an exit from its US business and the sale of its remaining stake in Dutch subsidiary Delta Lloyd.</p><p>Aviva edged up 0.4p to 268.4p but another insurer, motor specialist <strong>Admiral</strong>, was the leading riser up 32p at £11.16. It benefited from figures showing a fall in whiplash claims in the UK the year to March following three years of increase. Exane analyst Hughes, who obtained the data, said:</p><p><blockquote>Government action on referral fees paid to lawyers is due to come into force in April next year, so the decline in the year to March 2012 is a surprise. We expect this could be a result of increasing action from insurers in whiplash black spots to investigate fraudulent claims.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished just 1.48 points higher at 5351.53. During the course of another uncertain week, the leading index managed to gain just over 80 points despite a number of negative developments. Talk of a Greek exit from the euro grew stronger, France and Germany failed to agree on issuing eurobonds to help ease the crisis, leading Spanish bank Bankia was suspended ahead of an injection of new government funds and one of the biggest Spanish regions, Catalonia, indicated it might need further government funds to meet its financial obligations.</p><p></p><p>Investors took some heart from comments from Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who called for more action from EU governments to avoid further disaster, while in the UK, Thursday's news of a deeper than expected recession prompted renewed calls for further quantitative easing. There were also better than expected German, French and US consumer confidence figures.</p><p>But banks came under pressure again, not least because of the Bankia situation. <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> lost 1.11p to 25.8p, <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland </strong>ended down 0.57p at 20.87p and <strong>Barclays</strong> dropped 3.6p to 181.7p.</p><p>Among the FTSE risers, <strong>Tullow Oil</strong> added 32p to £13.95p. The company issued a positive drilling update from Kenya, having admitting it had earlier inadvertently revealed the information to a group of investors in Nairobi.</p><p><strong>Aggreko</strong> added 50p to £21.57 after HSBC raised its recommendation on the temporary power supplier from neutral to overweight, and its price target from £18 to £24. The bank said the market was focused on Aggreko's international power projects business, but the outlook for its shares would be more driven by the company's local operations:</p><p><blockquote>We have seen a strengthening in several industrial and commodity-related indicators in the first quarter of 2012. Historically, these have correlated closely with growth in the local business.</blockquote></p><p></p><p><strong>Hammerson </strong>ended 0.3p lower at 422.1p. Earlier in the week the property group had been boosted by bid speculation, with talk of possible interest from Australia's Westfield or a sovereign wealth fund.</p><p>Elsewhere <strong>Logica</strong> finished 0.25p higher at 65.9p after UBS raised its recommendation on the IT services group from neutral to buy, despite concerns about the effect of the eurozone crisis on its continental operations.</p><p>But <strong>Dixons Retail</strong> dipped 0.26p to 13.99 despite unveiling a £300m banking facility and saying it was on track to repay £160m worth of bonds due in November. The new agreement with its banking syndicate effectively extends its current facility, which was due to mature next year, until June 2015. The financial covenants have been relaxed slightly, reflecting an improvement in the group's cash generation.</p><p><strong>Thomas Cook</strong> slipped 0.25p to 21p. A couple of days after announcing the sale of its 77% stake in its Indian operations to Canada's Fairfax Financial for £94m to help reduce its debt, the company unveiled a new chief executive in the form of Harriet Green of electronics business Premier Farnell.</p><p>Industrial group <strong>Cape</strong> crashed 118.5p to 205p following a profit warning thanks to a £14m write-off on an liquefied natural gas project in Algeria.</p><p><strong>Yell</strong> lost 12% to 1.75p after Moody's downgraded the struggling directories group following its figures on Tuesday. The company has said it plans a restructuring to address its £2bn of debt, and admitted its move from print to digital was taking longer than expected. It also intends renaming itself Hibu, a word which appears to have no meaning at all. Moodys said:</p><p><blockquote>The downgrade reflects the agency's belief that, following previous market debt purchases, a material debt restructuring with a debt writedown in the order of 50% is likely.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Meanwhile Gareth Davies at Numis issued a sell note and cut his target from 3p to 1p, saying:</p><p><blockquote>Given gearing levels, the risk around bank facility renegotiation and the possibility of a debt for equity swap we feel Yell equity is simply not worth the risk even at current lowly levels.</blockquote></p><p></p><p><strong>HomeServe</strong> lost another 2p to 142p. The insurer and repairs group said earlier in the week that the Financial Services Authority was investigating possible mis-selling issues. The company suspended its telesales operations last year while it looked at how policies were sold and marketing, and now plans to cut back on its UK operations.</p><p>Espirito Santo analyst David Brockton said:</p><p><blockquote>An FSA investigation brings HomeServe further material risk of reputational damage and a lengthier than expected review process. While it also presents an opportunity for regulatory resolution, until that outcome looks certain we continue to view the risk profile as high. We lower our earnings per share forecasts by around 20% and our fair value from 285p to 210p. While our fair value is materially above the current volatile share price, there remains a wide range of possible regulatory outcomes hence we expect the shares to trade below the perceived inherent value of the business. We retain a neutral rating.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Caroline de La Soujeole at Seymour Pierce said:</p><p><blockquote>With a potential FSA fine hanging over Homeserve's head, like the sword of Damocles, we believe the shares will do no better than tread water until the process is concluded. As yet, there is no indication as to how long this may take. However, following a 36% decline in the share price this week, we believe most of the bad news is priced in. We therefore move from reduce to hold with a 150p target price.</blockquote></p><p></p><p><strong>CSR</strong>, the chip designer whose technology is used in headphones, speaker systems and cars, dipped 2.6p to 205.6p despite a positive analyst reaction to a visit to its Cambridge site on Thursday. Eoin Lambe of Liberum Capital said:</p><p><blockquote>[CSR] outlined five key areas of R&amp;D investment (voice and music, location, imaging, autos, BT low energy) and potential growth. It finally showed infamous [wi-fi and bluetooth] combination chip working in final silicon, although no revenue expected for another 12 months or so. Post the acquisition of [US company] Zoran, CSR has a very diverse portfolio of technologies (BT, WiFi, GPS, imaging) and end markets, which investors struggle to get to grips with. Granted the CSR story is not the most exciting (or clear cut), it is very cheap versus Wolfson, its closest peer in the UK.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Fellow technology group <strong>Arm</strong> also hosted a series of presentations for investors, setting out its vision up until 2020 and prompting a buy note from UBS:</p><p><blockquote>Arm's analyst day provided a useful reminder that Arm has substantial opportunities to further penetrate the semi industry and it is comforting that using management expectations and assuming market growth of 3-5% into our model would result in around 130p of upside to our valuation. Arm remains one of the highest quality ways to invest in the, still emergent, theme of digitisation.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Arm ended 4p lower at 491.2p.</p><p>Finally <strong>Cove Energy </strong>edged up another 0.5p to 254p amid hopes of a bid battle for the East Africa focused explorer. It had agreed a 220p a share bid from Royal Dutch Shell, but this was trumped on Wednesday after Thailand's PTT offered 240p, valuing Cove at nearly £1.2bn. Shell has said it is considering its options, with analyst Stuart Joyner at Investec saying it had the flexibility to raise its offer to around 300p a share.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/may/25/ftse-weekly-rise-aviva","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2012/may/25/ftse-weekly-rise-aviva","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Fred Pearce: Land grabbing has more of an impact on the world's poor than climate change","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-19T23:03:00Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2012/may/20/fred-pearce-land-grab-interview","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>What inspired you to write <em>The Land Grabbers</em>?</strong></p><p>Over the last few years, I became aware of this hidden revolution taking place around the world: the buying up of vast swaths of land by foreign entities from beneath its occupiers. Soaring grain prices in 2007/2008 led to countries such as Saudi Arabia and South Korea worrying about their national food security and buying up overseas land. Then speculators and investors started piling in on the back of that. The net result is that poor farmers and cattle herders across the world are being thrown off their land. Land grabbing is having more of an impact on the lives of poor people than climate change. No one has put together the global picture of land grabbing so I wanted to take a closer look. </p><p><strong>How much land has been grabbed?</strong></p><p>No one really knows. A lot of reported deals never happen and a lot of the largest are done secretly. Oxfam says more than two million square kilometres in the last decade have been grabbed, two-thirds of them in Africa. That's like Spain, France, Britain, Italy and Germany put together.</p><p><strong>Who's doing the grabbing?</strong></p><p>A vast and colourful cast of characters: Gulf sheikhdoms, jumpy governments worried about food security, Chinese state corporations, Wall Street and City speculators, Russian oligarchs, Gaddafi's henchmen among many. Also some big conservation funds. Most likely your pension fund has a slice of the action too.</p><p><strong>How did you research the book?</strong></p><p>I'm an old-fashioned reporter – I want to go see. So I'd read about a big land deal in the papers and go to find what was going on. I travelled to 10 or so countries where the most egregious grabbing is taking place: the savannah of Brazil, the forests of Indonesia, the inner Niger delta of Mali.</p><p><strong>Some governments bend over backwards for the grabbers…</strong></p><p>If you drive into one region of Tanzania your mobile phone beeps with a text welcoming you to the United Arab Emirates. A major general in the UAE army has bought exclusive hunting rights to a 400,000-hectare national park there. There are stories of them using spotlights off vehicles at night to shoot leopards with AK47s and burning the bush to beat the game towards the guns. And the Tanzanian government's elite paramilitary unit keeps the Masai families off the land.</p><p><strong>Who's losing out?</strong></p><p>Wherever I went, people were being moved off with little or no regard for their historic or cultural rights. The grabbers want big spaces – 50,000 hectares – and you can only get that if you take commonly owned ancestral lands. They come in and put in an airstrip and a compound and roads and canals and the villagers are told to go to the nearest town and they lose absolutely everything.</p><p><strong>You wrote the first popular book on climate change, </strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Turning-Up-Heat-Perilous-Greenhouse/dp/0370312600/ref=sr_1_18?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337097719&amp;sr=1-18\" title=\"Turning up the Heat\"><strong><em>Turning up the Heat</em></strong></a><strong>, in 1989. How's that story going?</strong></p><p>We have political consensus; the clean energy technology is there; it's in our interests environmentally and economically; smart corporations can make a profit from the change; and we have shown with the banking crisis that if there's a trillion dollar price-tag, we can pay it. But still nothing. If we can fix the banking system, then why not the climate system? It's governments that lack the balls.</p><p><strong>What about the theory that what the west does is irrelevant, what with the eastern economies growing so rapidly?</strong></p><p>Well, the Chinese have an environmental movement. There's huge concern about local pollution – smog, kids with high levels of lead from smelters, chronic poisoning and so on. It's like eastern Europe before the Berlin Wall came down – environmentalism was how political space was developed. It was the channel by which you could attack the political system. It wasn't directly attacking the state or the Communist party but it was a damn good way of coming in the side door.</p><p><strong>In 2006, you wrote </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781903919880\" title=\"The Last Generation\"><strong><em>The Last Generation</em></strong></a><strong>, a book about tipping points rapidly speeding up climate change.</strong></p><p>There's huge concern about this. Historically, climate change does not happen in a gradual way, we have periods of stability and then a lurch. Over the last few years, we've been losing dramatically more Arctic sea ice in the summer than was predicted. There are concerns that the monsoons could switch off as a result of current changes in the Atlantic and that warming could cause methane to bubble out of the melting Siberian permafrost, which would then speed up warming even more. So things could get out of control much quicker than predictions suggest.</p><p><strong>What makes a good science writer?</strong></p><p>Some see themselves as part of the scientific priesthood, but you should be independent, like a political correspondent looking at politicians.

There was some disturbing stuff in terms of people taking shortcuts, trying to ensure that rival scientists didn't get their stuff published, colluding against freedom of information requests. It didn't undermine the climate change science but it deserved the light of day. A lot of people didn't like me writing it up.</p><p><strong>In </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781905811120\" title=\"Confessions of an Eco Sinner\"><strong><em>Confessions of an Eco Sinner</em></strong></a><strong><em>,</em> you traced your own environmental footprint. Did you change lifestyle after that?</strong></p><p>Not a great deal, I have to admit. My house leaks energy and in my work I fly a huge amount, which means my carbon footprint is sky high. My wife is still a better recycler than I am.</p><p><strong>But the journey made you think as much about your&nbsp;social footprint as your environmental one?</strong></p><p>It made me realise there's a kind of green imperialism where we are just screwing up a lot of lives for uncertain benefit and a sense of personal virtue. For example, the carbon footprint of flying green beans from Kenya is no greater than that of growing them in a hothouse in the Netherlands. And there is huge benefit attached to the farmer. How dare I decide that I want to penalise them to make myself feel a little bit better?</p><p><strong>What's the least green thing a person can do?</strong></p><p>Well, drinking Fiji Water, which has been shipped around the world from the South Pacific, doesn't make much sense. It rains here too.</p><p><strong>Most of the stories you cover seem full of pessimism.</strong></p><p>I'm interested in the life-support systems of the planet and they can be in peril without us knowing it. Take the ozone layer. Once scientists found that chlorine-based refrigerator chemicals were causing the problem we responded quickly and basically we only just caught it in time. Scientists say we might easily have used bromine-based chemicals in refrigerators instead, in which case we would have destroyed the ozone layer before we realised the problem.</p><p><strong>Does all this keep you up at night?</strong></p><p>No. You can plan for the future, but you can't predict it.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/5/15/1337098596630/ethiopia-villagers-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/20/fred-pearce-land-grab-interview","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/may/20/fred-pearce-land-grab-interview","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"TEDx stages Mogadishu conference to celebrate city's 'rebirth'","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-17T16:02:47Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2012/may/17/ted-somalia-conference-mogadishu","fields":{"body":"<p>\"I love Mogadishu, I love Mogadishu, I love Mogadishu!\" chanted Amir Issa, a Somali businessman and camel farmer. \"Please stand up, say that: I love Mogadishu!\"</p><p>A video camera panned around the room, showing the audience rising to its feet and joining in the chorus.

Encouraging the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of Africa's growing youth population to further stimulate rural economies is particularly important.\"</p><p>• More effective nutrition: \"Countries must develop co-ordinated interventions which boost nutrition while expanding access to health services, education, sanitation and clean water. The report cites research showing that mothers' education is a more powerful factor in explaining lower rates of malnutrition in children than is household income.\"</p><p></p><p>• Building resilience: \"Getting food from field to table in sub-Saharan Africa is fraught with risk. Countries should take measures to lower people's and communities' vulnerability to natural disasters and civil conflict, seasonal or volatile changes in food prices and climate change. The report recommends social protection programmes such as crop insurance, employment guarantee schemes, and cash transfers – all of which can shield people from these risks and boost incomes.\"</p><p>• Empowerment and social justice: \"Achieving food security in sub-Saharan Africa will remain out of reach so long as the rural poor, and especially women, who play a major role in food production, do not have more control over their own lives. Ensuring access to land, markets and information is an important step to empowerment. Bridging the gender divide is particularly vital: when women get access to the same inputs as men, yields can rise by more than 20%.\"</p><p>Tegegnework Gettu, director of UNDP's Africa bureau, said: \"It is a harsh paradox that in a world of food surpluses, hunger and malnutrition remain pervasive on a continent with ample agricultural endowments.

Photograph: Jamie Grill/Getty</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The hypothesis </strong>The traditional school day starts between 8am and 9am, and many teachers believe that pupils do their best work early in the morning. But research led by <a href=\"http://www.eye.ox.ac.uk/peoplefolder/russell-foster\" title=\"\">Russell Foster</a>, a professor of circadian neuroscience at the University of Oxford, has suggested that this may not actually be the case for teenagers.</p><p>He has found that the body clocks of teenagers run several hours behind those of adults and younger children, perhaps explaining their propensity for late nights and lie-ins. This raised a tantalising possibility: could it be that starting the secondary school a little later might actually improve learning, by allowing pupils to study at a time of day when they are naturally more alert?</p><p><strong>The experiment </strong>Foster's idea was ridiculed by the teaching unions, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/may/30/paul-kelley-monkseaton-space-learning\" title=\"\">Paul Kelley</a>, then headteacher of <a href=\"http://www.monkseaton.org.uk/Pages/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">Monkseaton high school</a> in Tyneside, thought it worth investigating. In 2010, he persuaded his governors to allow him to push back the start of the school day from 9am to 10am. An experiment was under way.</p><p>In August 2011, after the first full school year using the new timetable, Monkseaton's year 11 pupils recorded the best GCSE results in the school's history. The proportion of pupils achieving at least five GCSEs at grades A* to C rose by 19% on the previous year. Results were especially impressive in science and information and communications technology. Persistent absenteeism has also fallen by 27%. As things stand, this experiment proves little – as Kelley and Foster are the first to admit. It shows what's happened at a single school, over a single year – perhaps Monkseaton's year 11 was particularly bright, or perhaps the novelty of the new timetable, rather than the timetable itself, accounted for any benefits, which might thus fade over time. What it does reveal, however, is prima facie evidence that is worth following up properly. It would be relatively simple to run an RCT that would provide us with sound evidence. All the secondary schools in a particular region would be randomly assigned to start the school day at 9am or 10am. The exam results would then be tracked to see whether one group achieved statistically significant improvements in excess of the other.</p><h2><strong>ACADEMIES</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-390043449'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/5/11/1336764273576/Testing-academies-008.jpg' alt='Testing: academies' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Without trials it is difficult to benchmark the performance of new academies against other schools. Photograph: Jim Wileman</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The hypothesis </strong>Schools that are given academy status are made independent of the local authority, and have the opportunity to raise further funds from an individual or corporate sponsor. Academies can vary admissions policies and the curriculum. Many academies have recorded better exam results than their predecessor schools, but there is controversy over whether they sustainably raise standards. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>, the education&nbsp;secretary,&nbsp;is convinced of their value, and last year announced a plan to turn the 200 weakest primary schools into academies.</p><p><strong>The experiment </strong>As with previous academy initiatives, Gove's policy hasn't been designed as an experiment that could be rigorously evaluated. The 200 weakest schools might well improve after the change, but as there is no way of benchmarking them against similar schools, it will be difficult to determine whether any differences result from the policy or some other factor.</p><p>It could be that standards would have risen anyway – the statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean makes it likely that underperforming schools will improve by chance alone. It could be that extra money, or the impetus of new governors, has an impact unrelated to structure. Without a good experimental design, it's impossible to know.</p><p>This is a particular shame because Gove's policy could easily have been introduced in a different way that would have given us some real answers. Indeed, the large number of schools he wants to change, and the clear selection criteria, would have been ideal for a proper experiment.</p><p>Carole Torgerson, a professor of education at Durham University, suggests that it could work like this: the 200 worst performing primary schools would have been identified in the same way as is happening now, but they wouldn't all have been transformed into academies at once. Rather, the schools would be assigned at random to receive academy status either immediately, or a year or two later.</p><p>This staggered RCT would have created a well-matched control group, against which the schools that became academies immediately could have been compared. It would therefore become possible to chalk up any improvements to the policy. And if the&nbsp;results looked good, all the schools would go on to receive a proven intervention in a timely fashion.</p><h2><strong>DRUGS SENTENCING</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-390043450'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/5/11/1336764050192/Testing---drugs-001.jpg' alt='Testing – drugs' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>It is well established many crimes are funding drug addiction. Photograph: Mark Fagelson/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The hypothesis </strong>It is well established that many people convicted of crimes such as burglary are funding drug addiction. Treating such offenders, rather than incarcerating them, may therefore reduce recidivism.</p><p>Attracted by this, the Labour government introduced a new sentence in 1998, the drug treatment and testing order (DTTO). When a qualifying offender was convicted, he would take part in a mandatory treatment programme, with regular drug testing. A pilot project was deemed a success, and the policy was rolled out nationwide.</p><p><strong>The experiment </strong>It was commendable that the Home Office decided to launch a pilot study of DTTOs before introducing them more widely. But Sheila Bird, a professor at the MRC biostatistics unit in Cambridge, showed that the pilots were so badly designed as to be virtually worthless. First, they included too few young offenders to achieve statistical significance. Second, the research wasn't randomised.</p><p>Random allocation of research subject to intervention and control groups is one of the most powerful tools for conducting trials of human subjects. It leaves minimal room for bias, and without it there always remains a possibility that any differences observed between subjects and controls may be the result of underlying differences between the two groups, rather than a true effect.</p><p>It would have been a simple matter to randomise the DTTO pilot. When a qualifying offender was convicted, the judge would pass the sentence that he or she felt appropriate. But before that sentence was actually carried out, the judge would use a random code to assign the offender either to the normal sentence or to a DTTO.</p><p>Both DTTO and control groups would then be followed up for differences in recidivism rates after their sentences were over. All that would have differed between the two groups was the sentence, which would therefore explain any different patterns of reoffending.</p><p>In the real pilots, the judges were left to decide who was to receive DTTOs, creating great potential for bias: they could easily have been tempted to cherry-pick more serious offenders for one arm of the trial or the other, according to their prejudices. No pharmaceutical company would have got away with running a trial this shoddy. Yet it was sufficient to change a criminal justice policy.</p><h2><strong>FOREIGN AID</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-390043451'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/5/11/1336764175191/Testing---schools-001.jpg' alt='Testing – schools' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A charity study showed treating children medically improved performance more than supplying books. Photograph: Jerome Delay/AP</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The hypothesis </strong>In the 1990s, a Dutch development charity called International Christelijk Steunfonds decided to fund a programme to support education in Kenya. Previous research had suggested that providing African children with textbooks that they could not normally afford might improve their exam results, so the charity paid for 25 schools to receive sets of English, science and maths books. The charity, however, didn't just provide the books. It decided to run an experiment.</p><p><strong>The experiment </strong>As Tim Harford describes in his book <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9780349121512/adapt-why-success-always-starts-with-failure\" title=\"\"><em>Adapt</em></a>, ICS asked the Kenyan government not to select 25 schools that would receive the books, but to identify 100 schools that would be equally suitable. From these, 25 were selected at random. The books were delivered and exam results at the 25 intervention schools compared with those from the 75 similar schools without the extra teaching resources.</p><p>The textbooks, it turned out, made very little difference. ICS then tried another intervention – illustrated teaching flip-charts – in a similar randomised trial. Again, there was no significant effect.</p><p>So the charity tried a third approach, funding treatment for intestinal worms. This time, the trial followed a staggered design: 25 random schools received the treatment immediately, 25 after two years, and another 25 two years after that. This time, there was clear evidence: de-worming children unequivocally improved their learning, probably thanks to improved nutrition.</p><p>ICS had used the power of randomisation to identify how its limited resources could be spent most effectively. Few governments, alas, are as far-sighted.</p><p><em>Mark Henderson's book </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/scienceandnature/9780593068236/the-geek-manifesto-why-science-matters\" title=\"\"><em>The Geek Manifesto: Why Science Matters</em></a><em>, is published by Bantam Press (£18.99).

It has stealth technology to avoid enemy radar, ballistic missiles that could sink an aircraft carrier, and on this Nato-led trip off the coast of Somalia, a small company of heavily armed special forces divers, with their own speedboat.</p><p>So it is hardly surprising the Somali pirates are feeling a little outgunned at the moment.</p><p>The pirates take to the seas off the Horn of Africa in small dhows, and even smaller skiffs, armed with old machine guns and pistols, wearing flip-flops, and gambling that they will be able to hijack a vessel before they run out of food or water, or drown.</p><p>Over the past year, the number of successful pirate attacks fell from 45 to 24, and more than 120 others were foiled. But nobody involved in the military mission off the coast of east Africa believes the battle has been won. In fact, many senior officers believe the counter-piracy operation has reached a&nbsp;critical point.</p><p>Commanders estimate that for every pirate captured and sent for trial, another three or four are released. This year dozens of pirates have been put quietly back to shore, despite good evidence to support prosecution.</p><p>None of the countries in the region want to take a lead in piracy cases, and those that have been persuaded to take suspects – notably the Seychelles and Kenya – are essentially full up, and showing reluctance to take any more.</p><p>None of the governments sending warships to the area, including the UK, wants them either, even though the pirates cost the world economy an estimated $6.9bn (£4.3bn) last year.</p><p>So, without fanfare, more and more of the suspected pirates are being freed, the incentive to hunt them is slightly diminished, and the Somali criminals can hardly believe their luck. \"When I have told them [the pirates] that we are putting them back to shore they are more or less celebrating,\" said Commander Anders Friis, captain of the Absalon. \"They are very, very happy.\"</p><p>The Absalon has captured 58 suspected pirates during six months patrolling the Somali coast. Only eight are facing trial.</p><p>In February, it seized a crew of 17 suspected pirates and waited to hear which nation would volunteer to take them for prosecution. Thirty-eight days later, they got the answer: not one.</p><p>All of the suspects were taken back to shore close to where they had been caught, so they would not be set upon by rival tribes or gangs.</p><p>The Absalon's medics noted the men were, on average, 2kg heavier and far healthier than when they were captured.  A further 16 suspected pirates captured in April spent three weeks in the makeshift cells of the ship's cargo area. Lawyers working on Absalon thought the case against them was strong, but they can only recommend prosecution. Someone has to be willing to \"host\" a trial, and there aren't many takers. Last week 12 of the pirates were released.</p><p>The ship's commander, Anders Friis, is stoical and says he is not frustrated. But he adds: \"We are professional. We are doing our job. Obviously it is best to get them prosecuted.</p><p>\"My problem is this … every time we are putting people to shore [the pirates] have been informed about how these things work, what our tactics are. It makes it more difficult to solve the problem because they are developing their own tactics.\"</p><p>A senior member of his crew was less diplomatic. \"It is a ridiculous situation. We are doing what we were asked to do, but we end up going round and round in circles. We have become a prison ship, not a warship.\"</p><p>The problems of piracy from Somalia have been growing since 2005. Although it is an international problem, it was deemed serious enough by David Cameron to make it a UK foreign policy priority, which is why London hosted a conference on Somalia in February.</p><p>Beset by civil war, poverty and famine, and unable to compete with modern international fishing vessels from other countries, some Somalis, backed by criminal gangs, turned to piracy to make money – and judged by this criterion alone, they have been extremely successful.</p><p>Even though hijackings were down last year, the pirates raised $159.6m from 31 paid ransoms, including $13.5m for the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/us-greece-somalia-idUSTRE73730U20110408\" title=\"\">release of the Greek-owned tanker Irene SL</a>, which was carrying 2m barrels of oil. That was the highest sum ever paid.</p><p>On average, hostages are held 178 days, but some are kept much longer. Some do not come back at all: 24 died last year.</p><p>In Somalia, the economic model for piracy is working well. In 2010, the US, EU and the UK gave the country a combined $298m in aid – less than half the sum pocketed by the pirates when light aircraft dropped waterproof containers full of cash into the waters near their beach settlements.</p><p>This activity has changed the economic model for the whole shipping industry, which spent $5.5bn last year on combating the problem, according to the <a href=\"http://www.oneearthfuture.org/index.php?id=48&amp;pid=37&amp;page=Piracy\" title=\"\">Oceans Beyond Piracy</a> study by the One Earth Future foundation (OEF).</p><p>Ships are having to reroute and take on armed guards, and the companies that own them are paying hefty insurance premiums, as well as the ransoms. With more than 42,000 commercial ships travelling through the waters around Somalia every year, and no end to the supply of pirates, the incentives are weighted in favour of the criminals rather than business.</p><p>This has provoked governments to set&nbsp;up three military missions – run by Nato, the EU, and a multinational \"combined task force\"– which patrol the expanses of sea in which the pirates mostly operate.</p><p>In terms of disrupting attacks, the naval missions, which have 16 warships, have just had their most successful year, but warning lights are already flashing for the future.</p><p>Though 1,089 piracy suspects have been seized in the past five years, there are signs legal systems are gumming up with new cases, and that the courts have already reached saturation point in the Seychelles and Kenya.</p><p>There is also concern about the pirates developing new tactics, and changing the rules of the game. \"In 2011, we witnessed a worrying development,\" says the OEF study.</p><p>\"In some instances, after receiving a ransom, pirates have released the vessel but not all of the crew. In other cases the vessel has been abandoned and hostages have been taken ashore in Somalia, where pirates have demanded a ransom for their release.\"</p><p>Attacks on tourist resorts in Kenya, such as the one that led to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/13/kenya-britons-couple-killing\" title=\"\">death of the Briton David Tebbutt last September</a>, is another concern. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/21/british-hostage-freed-kidnappers-somalia?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">His wife, Judith, was released in March</a> after a ransom was paid.</p><p>Because the warships cannot operate inside the territorial waters of Oman and Yemen, that is where the pirates are heading – another sign the criminals are trying to adapt to new circumstances, rather than give up the trade.</p><p>Aboard the warships in the current taskforce off Somalia, the captains and crews feel they have a good understanding about the pirates, how they operate, and how to capture them.</p><p>As well as the frigates and destroyers, the French have an Awacs surveillance plane in the area. Although no Nato official will admit it, the assumption is the US is supplying intelligence from unmanned drones operating from a base to the north in Djibouti.</p><p>The Guardian was shown a series of classified surveillance photographs used by Nato commanders. They reveal the position of the pirate camps and how they are set up. In some cases the pictures are so clear it is possible to make out faces.</p><p>The sites are home to up to 45 men, and are incredibly basic. They are often square, with upturned boats providing cover for sleeping and the most rudimentary workshops for repairing outboard engines.</p><p>The coastal towns of Eyl and Garacad in the north, and of Hobyo, further south, have been the focus of Nato's attention, and by carefully mapping which dhows are moored where, the warships can tag the ones they want to track.</p><p>The pirates on the beach are only the foot soldiers, but it is not difficult to identify the \"Mr Bigs\". They are the ones who have built modern houses with stone walls close to fishing villages that haven't changed in decades.</p><p>\"The pirates are very much aware of what is going on,\" says Friis. \"They have an extended network and they adapt. They are sharing information and developing new tactics ... and they are getting much tougher.\"</p><p>The proof, he says, is in the way suspected pirates behave when the Absalon approaches.</p><p>\"They are more or less ignoring us,\" he says. \"They know we will act in self-defence and they know that it is not a very good idea to point their guns at us. They also know we have strict guidelines about not hurting&nbsp;anyone.\"</p><p>Trying to unravel the pirates' machismo is also a challenge. When the Absalon seized 16 suspected pirates on 11 April, Friis gave them a chance to go free.</p><p>\"They had taken some Iranian and Pakistani hostages so we had to separate them from the pirate suspects,\" said Lieutenant Commander Claus Krum, a&nbsp;veteran of five piracy missions.</p><p>\"Once we'd done that we told the suspected pirates they could stay with us or get into a skiff and return to Somalia, and we would not shoot them. They chose to stay.\" He adds: \"They have a totally different mindset, and a code. They don't want to lose face.</p><p>\"Some of them may already be in debt and will fear they will get beaten up if they go straight back to Somalia. They don't show any anger or remorse or guilt.\"</p><p>Better, then, for the pirates to take their chances on the Absalon, in the hope that they will probably be released in a few weeks, credibility intact.</p><p>Krum is not the only officer on board the Absalon who has concluded that the counter-piracy operation is a sticking plaster, and that the only way to stop piracy is to tackle the poverty at its&nbsp;source. \"Somalia needs more subsidy, and probably peacekeeping forces on the ground too. Until then, we have to try to&nbsp;deter and avoid piracy.\"</p><p>Mathais Buck, the Absalon's chief legal officer, ensures the captured men are looked after in the caged cells in which they are kept most of the day and night.</p><p>The suspects are given carpets to pray on, magazines, regular health checks and the same food as the ship's crew. \"This isn't like two conventional armies in conflict.</p><p>\"We are not at war. It is the pirates against countries that are used to having laws governing what they do.\"</p><p>That means that the Danes will not want to keep them on board for too long without getting them legal representation, and since so few countries are prepared to mount prosecutions, the pressure to let them go increases with every passing day.</p><p>Captain Jeremy Hill, commander of the American frigate USS Taylor, admits it is getting harder to distinguish between legitimate fishermen and the pirates.</p><p>Both go to sea in the same places, in same sort of dhows and armed with the same type of guns.</p><p>\"If there is a grey area, we err on the side of caution without a doubt.\" Hill says that Nato \"doesn't want us to let up at all\", but everyone involved in the military mission is aware of the negative publicity that comes with setting suspects free. Hill admits he would now notify the overall commander of the Nato mission before detaining anyone.</p><p>\"The significant part of the solution is on land,\" he says. \"It is not just up to Nato to find a legal solution.\"</p><p>In fact, it is not up to Nato at all. Once a Royal Navy warship has detained suspects, it is up to the UK to assess the strength of the case, and then cast around for a country to take on the prosecution – if it is not prepared to take it on itself.</p><p>The prospect of Somali pirates being brought to trial here, where they would undoubtedly apply for asylum, is one of the reasons ministers have vehemently refused to accept any cases.</p><p>\"The legal finish is a problem, but it is one that is completely out of military control,\" said one senior naval officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p>\"For every pirate that goes to legal finish there are three or four that end up being put back ashore. \"I still think there is huge value in disrupting activity … but people do hold a lot of store by getting the pirates to court, and the legal success rate is very low.\"</p><p>Jack Lang, the UN secretary general's special adviser on Somali piracy, believes the ratios are even worse than that, claiming last year that \"90% of pirates captured by states patrolling the seas will be released without being prosecuted\".</p><p>The Foreign Office recognises the problem. The UK has given money to the Seychelles to support its legal system; two members of the Crown Prosecution Service have been on the islands&nbsp;to speed up trials, and three prison officers from the Isle of Wight have also been seconded to the Montagne Posse prison.</p><p>But the Seychelles can hold only a maximum of 70 pirates at a time, and has little prison capacity.</p><p>The hope is that new jails in the more stable areas of Somaliland and Puntland in the north of Somalia will house convicted pirates serving their prison terms, but this idea is still evolving.</p><p>Last year the <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/\" title=\"\">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a> started work on the construction of two prisons at Garowe and Hargeisa.</p><p>It has also contributed to the opening of a counter-piracy courtroom in Mombasa.</p><p>\"Our aim is to help set up a network of regional centres in Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles and Tanzania to prosecute suspected Somali pirates who, if convicted, are returned to Somalia to serve their sentences in secure and humane prisons,\" said a Foreign Office spokesman.</p><p>\"The first transfer of convicted pirates from the Seychelles back to Somalia took place at the end of March, signalling a step-change in the way we combat Somali piracy in the Indian Ocean region.\"</p><p>But though the steps are important, they are still small, and the regional legal systems are struggling to cope with the suspects already in custody, let alone ones in the future.</p><p>Which leaves some in the military mission asking if it is time for a rethink.</p><p>\"There is an argument over whether the military should be doing any more than it already is,\" said one commander. \"Somali piracy cannot be solved by us. It is primarily a civil problem, which needs to be solved on land, not at sea.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/8/1336480229600/Somali-pirates-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/08/outgunned-somali-pirates-luck","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/may/08/outgunned-somali-pirates-luck","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Boot up: selling Bing, Gosling on Android, Apple's malware ratio, mobile's win and more","webPublicationDate":"2012-05-01T07:30:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/blog/2012/may/01/technology-links-newsbucket","fields":{"body":"<p>A quick burst of 7 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team</p><h2><a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57423213-93/twitter-sets-its-sights-on-2-billion-users/\">Twitter sets its sights on 2 billion users &gt;&gt; CNET News</a></h2><blockquote><p>\"Everything we are doing is oriented around getting to 2 billion users.\"</p><p> You might think that statement was from Mark Zuckerberg, as Facebook approaches 1 billion active users on its social network and focuses on the next billion.

It's also a commonly held belief that chip performance doubles every 18 months.</p><p> But Moore's Law won't be true forever, and in this video theoretical physicist Michio Kaku explains how it will collapse. And that collapse isn't going to happen in some distant future, it is going to happen within the next decade.</p></blockquote><p> We feel like we've been hearing this for a decade, though.

But reliable data has been hard to find. Now, an international coalition of NGOs and research groups <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/apr/27/international-land-deals-database-africa\" title=\"\">has published the world's largest database of deals</a> struck since 2000, offering unprecedented detail on who's investing, where and what for.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.landportal.info/landmatrix\">database</a>, launched on Thursday, includes 1,006 deals covering 70.2m hectares (173m acres) – or roughly half the size of western Europe. Data on further deals will be added on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Some highlights from the database:</p><blockquote><p>• Eastern Africa has the largest number of recent investments, with 310 deals.</p><p>• Indonesia is the country with the largest area of land acquired by investors – 9.5m hectares. The Democratic Republic of the Congo comes second, with almost 8.1m hectares.</p><p>• The Indian government, Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE International and Indonesian company Indah Kiat Pulp &amp; Paper are the top three investors, having acquired more than 10m hectares around the world between them.</p><p>• The vast majority of the deals are for agricultural projects (690 deals covering 50.2m hectares). Forestry is the next largest sector (94 deals covering 12.7m hectares).</p><p>• Of the agricultural deals, fewer than 30% are for food crops alone. Almost 20% are for non-food crops such as biofuels and livestock feed.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href=\"http://www.landportal.info/landmatrix\">Land Matrix database</a> is now the most comprehensive public source for information on international land deals – but it is not perfect. Some countries, for example, may be over-represented in the data simply because they are more transparent and routinely publish contract information. In other cases, the data may be skewed towards investors or countries that have featured in more media reports.</p><p>This makes it difficult to draw too many conclusions from the data. For example, there appears to be a sharp decline in deals since 2009 – but although this could correspond to a drop in investments, it could also be driven by a fall in media interest or an increasing reluctance to disclose information about deals.</p><p>Researchers warn that smaller deals are often harder to track and may be under-represented in the database. Data for deals struck after 2010 is still being collected, cross-checked and verified.</p><p>Researchers hope that releasing the data and inviting the public to crowdsource new information will help address some of these issues. <a href=\"http://www.landportal.info/landmatrix\">The site</a> lets users \"report a land deal\" or submit further details on deals already recorded. This information will be independently verified by researchers before being included in the database.</p><p>We have pulled out all the data on who's investing, where and what for.

Investors are in an expectant froth about the imminent Facebook IPO, an estimated $100bn flotation built on harvesting the personal likes of 900 million members (according to its newest financial figures). There's the smaller but equally eye-popping $3.2bn (32 times earnings) valuation of a Big Data analytics firm, <a href=\"http://www.splunk.com/\" title=\"\">Splunk</a>. And there's what might be considered the curious acquisition by <a href=\"http://www.walmart.com/\" title=\"\">Walmart</a> of the popular Facebook app start-up, <a href=\"http://www.socialcalendar.com/\" title=\"\">Social Calendar</a>. Curious that is until you start imagining what a retailer the size of Walmart could do with all that data about your best friend's birthday, your wedding anniversary or your summer holiday plans.</p><p>Even as we continue to share extraordinary amounts of formerly private (or at least almost inaccessible) information in our Faustian bargain for better, more useful social media experiences, a privacy backlash is growing. Just last week, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web,   <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/18/tim-berners-lee-google-facebook?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">warned of the dangers</a> in putting so much personal data in the hands of just a few social networking companies, and urged Netizens to demand access to their personal data from the likes of Facebook and Google.</p><p>Of course, excitement and fear about data mining have been competing since the birth of the web. I remember a company all-hands meeting back in 2000 when my then publisher spoke excitedly about how online customer relationship management (CRM) would transform the media business and our publication in particular. (The dot-com crash put paid to the second part of that prediction.) Fast-forward 12 years and the new online analytics boom business is social-CRM – mining social network conversations, likes and follows to intuit and predict customer behaviour.</p><p>The reason for the new boom is the explosion in online data being created and shared. According to the technology research firm, <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/about/about.jsp\" title=\"\">IDC</a>, data is growing at 50% a year. One recent report from the World Economic Forum, <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/reports/big-data-big-impact-new-possibilities-international-development\" title=\"\">Big Data, Big Impact</a>, boldly classed data a new economic asset, like currency or gold. As new social technologies and platforms come online, and as the Internet of Things begins to mature these streams of data will explode, and the companies that mine them will likely have even more power over our lives than ever before.</p><p>But, hold on a second. Does the Big Data revolution have to scripted like an out-take from Minority Report? Even as companies fine-tune their Big Data targeting in order to sell us more stuff in locations and at times when we least expect it, a growing movement of data scientists are asking the question: how can we use Big Data for social good?</p><p>This is the focus of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jun/23/data-without-borders-jake-porway?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Jake Porway</a>, the founder of Data Without Borders. A data scientist at the New York Times by day, Porway has lit a fire under the data analytics community by mobilising a small army of volunteer data geeks to help crunch solutions for social projects. In one example, <a href=\"http://datawithoutborders.cc/\" title=\"\">Data Without Borders</a> helped the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> understand whether the New York Police Department was guilty of racial profiling (and whether they were working to meet arrest quotas) by <a href=\"http://datawithoutborders.cc/york-city-datadive/\" title=\"\">analysing and mapping</a> the publicly available arrest logs of NYPD beat officers. Its next collaborative goal <a href=\"http://datawithoutborders.cc/2012/04/dwb-heads-chicago-511/\" title=\"\">is helping Chicago</a> non-profit organisations unlock some of their Big Data answers.</p><p>What Porway is enabling in the US, <a href=\"http://ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a>, a crisis-mapping outfit has been pioneering globally since 2008. Ushahidi (testimony in Swahili) started mapping reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout that year. Since then its team of data mappers have created platforms for tracking and crowdsourcing texts, emails along with social media updates from blogs and Twitter that have helped in countless crises, including the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Japan tsunami as well as Libya's revolution.</p><p>The potential for using smart data and social technologies to drive sustainability is also taking root in academia. Smart data thinkers from <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/\" title=\"\">MIT</a>, <a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/\" title=\"\">Northeastern University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.harvard.edu/\" title=\"\">Harvard</a>  and the <a href=\"http://www.santafe.edu/\" title=\"\">Santa Fe Institute</a> are working on a collaborative project, ESS (short for <a href=\"http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ess/\" title=\"\">Engineering Social Systems</a>). Some of the research projects it is considering include using Big Data modelling to predict food shortage in sub-Saharan Africa and using techniques such as expectation-maximisation to create economic systems that enable people to earn small amounts of money by completing simple tasks on their phones. Now imagine the business opportunities for forward-thinking telcos, mobile players and agricultural/food producers that focused their efforts on these types of sustainability projects?</p><p>Some of the biggest technology and engineering companies are starting to do just that. Current data-mapping projects in Rio de Janeiro by <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/us/en/\" title=\"\">IBM</a> – part of its <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/smarter_cities/overview/index.html\" title=\"\">Smarter Cities initiative</a> – along with other urban partnership schemes run by <a href=\"http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/en/\" title=\"\">Siemens</a> and <a href=\"http://www.philips.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Philips</a> (I'll be writing in more detail about social tech in sustainable cities in a different column) all point to a small but important emerging corporate trend of analysing Big Data not just to mainline sales channels but to navigate a path to more sustainable living and business.</p><p>According to the New York Times, as the Big Data economy continues to grow, the US needs 140,000 to 190,000 more workers with \"deep analytical\" expertise and 1.5 million more data-literate managers. Let's hope a good chunk of that expertise can be employed towards harnessing Big Data for sustainability. As Porway said in a speech at a recent <a href=\"http://poptech.org/about_poptech_conferences\" title=\"\">Poptech conference</a>, \"What if we started using data, not just to ask what type of movie we wanted but to see but what type of world we want to see?\"</p><p>Now that's \"Social\" CRM we could all embrace.</p><p><em>Matthew Yeomans is the co-author of </em><a href=\"http://socialmediainfluence.com/research/fail-the-50-greatest-social-media-screw-ups/\" title=\"\"><em>#FAIL: The 50 Greatest Social Media Screw-Ups</em></a><em> and co-founder of </em><a href=\"http://socialmediainfluence.com/\" title=\"\"><em>SMI</em></a></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Just over 70% of that (£140m) was spent through the UN Development Programme (UNDP).</p><p></p><p>In a report evaluating UK funding for UNDP-led projects, Icai said the UN agency may deliver \"technically sound assistance\", but tends to prioritise short-term projects over the development of local capacity. In some cases, it said, this has left countries in need of continuing aid.</p><p></p><p>Working with the UNDP has often meant dealing with short-term planning, according to the report, along with delays in aid delivery, an emphasis on fundraising over cost control and attention to \"value for money\", and a tendency to support overly complex technical solutions at the expense of developing sustainable systems. It said UK aid through the UNDP has contributed to the successful conduct of individual elections, but that DfID should seek other partners and reduce its dependence on the UN agency.</p><p></p><p>The Icai chief commissioner, Graham Ward, said UK assistance has helped reduce the risks of conflict and political crises. \"There are, however, tensions between the imperative to deliver elections successfully and the goal of long-term capacity building,\" he said. \"DfID needs to consider more carefully how to balance these two goals.\"</p><p></p><p>The report cites the example of the May 2009 elections in Malawi, which fell short of international standards according to some observers, including the EU. DfID contributed £4.5m (36%) to the UNDP's £12.5m project to improve the management and technical capacity of the national electoral commission and help deliver the elections.</p><p></p><p>Although peaceful elections were held, and considered an improvement on those in 2004, with voter turnout rising to 78% from 54%, the report criticised UNDP technical assistance for failing to sustainably transfer knowledge and skills to local authorities. Icai found \"no sustainable impact on capacity for running elections\", and warned that future elections in the country are likely to need similar levels of support.</p><p></p><p>The 2008 parliamentary elections in Bangladesh are cited as an exception – the UNDP had supported the national electoral commission for 10 years before the elections. But even here, Icai said it found little evidence the country could manage future elections without international assistance.</p><p></p><p>The report says the UNDP is too often constrained by its political mandate to maintain relationships with the government of the day. \"This makes them reluctant to deliver hard messages on behalf of the international community,\" it says, adding that the agency tends to limit its engagement with opposition parties and civil society groups critical of the government.</p><p></p><p>Icai remained unconvinced that the UNDP maximises \"value for money\". It said it found no evidence of effective cost controls and that it instead saw examples of where the UN agency seemed to measure its success based on how much money it raised. \"UNDP's chief concern is to mobilise funding from bilateral donors for its electoral assistance, rather than to control costs,\" it said.</p><p></p><p>According to the report, a tendency to choose complex or technologically advanced equipment is a key problem in how UNDP-led election support is often delivered. The report questioned the use of UK aid for projects in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to use biometric technology for voter registration, requiring laptops, webcams, fingerprint scanners, colour printers and mobile generators.</p><p></p><p>Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, said his department was working closely with the UNDP to \"ensure their projects are well-planned and deliver constant value for money, especially in fragile and conflict-ridden states. I fully support the commission's findings and will continue to work with the UN to implement them.\"</p><p></p><p>Last year, the UK multilateral aid review concluded that the UNDP delivered good \"value for money\" but raised <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/What-we-do/Who-we-work-with/Multilateral-agencies/Multilateral-Aid-Review-summary---United-Nations-Development-Programme-UNDP/\" title=\"\">concerns</a> about the UN agency's financial management and ability to demonstrate results.</p><p></p><p>DfID <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/What-we-do/Key-Issues/Governance-and-conflict/Democratic-governance/\" title=\"\">says it will support 300 million voters in elections in 13 countries by 2015</a> – including those in Kenya and Sierra Leone this year. Past electoral assistance has included support for the design of voting systems, the determination of electoral boundaries, voter registration and education projects, and training for political parties and the media.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/4/24/1335278711021/MDG--Dfid-aid-for-electio-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/apr/25/uk-aid-overseas-elections-benefits","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/apr/25/uk-aid-overseas-elections-benefits","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Colonial papers and the ugly legacy of empire | Michael White","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-18T12:11:04Z","sectionId":"uk-news","id":"uk/blog/2012/apr/18/colonial-papers-ugly-legacy-empire","fields":{"body":"<p>What links the suspected murder of China-based British businessman, Neil Heywood, with the  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-records-colonial-crimes\" title=\"\">part-publication  of long-hidden colonial files </a>from the last decade of the British empire? Why, Foreign Office and M16 secrecy, of course. Throw in Wednesday morning's news that Jack Straw is being sued  by a Libyan <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/apr/18/jack-straw-libya-rendition\" title=\"\">over his alleged role in extraordinary rendition </a>and the link is irresistible.</p><p>When I bumped into Labour's Denis MacShane on Tuesday, the MP was confident that he would seriously embarrass William Hague over the Heywood affair when he challenged him later that afternoon over the slow way in which the alleged crime emerged. You can catch it at <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120417/debtext/120417-0001.htm#12041733000021\" title=\"\">column 171 in Hansard </a>– though the foreign secretary seems to have survived unscathed.</p><p>Hague is reportedly asking the Beijing embassy, its spooks and diplomats, why it didn't flag up the gossip about light drinker Heywood's suspicious death and rapid cremation – the cause attributed to alcoholic excess – rather sooner. Straw, who last year denied in public that the then-Labour government had connived in any form of rendition, must be asking the FCO why he is being accused of having signed something which suggests otherwise.</p><p>In other words, the spirit of Yes Minister's Sir Humphrey lives on.</p><p>Of course, Foreign Office officials and the espionage community across the Thames at Vauxhall Cross are going to try to avoid making waves with mighty China over the death of a businessman operating in the shadows with powerful local friends. It's easy to imagine officials wanting to hush up the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/alexander-litvinenko\" title=\"\">troublesome murder of Russian exile Alexander Litvenenko </a> if he hadn't been poisoned so conspicuously with polonium in a London hotel. Hush things up and burn the files – or risk costly lawsuits, not all of them noble ones? It's not hard to follow their train of thought.</p><p>So what should we make of those surviving archives which are finally being released from the government's high-security centre in Buckinghamshire to the clutches of historians eager to get hold of them in the National Archive, close to Kew Gardens on the Thames in west London?</p><p>Tony Badger, Master of Clare College, Cambridge, who is overseeing the transfer, says that most of the colonial records were weeded and burned, that the rest should have been published under the old 30-year rule in the 80s and that the whole affair is \"embarrassing, scandalous\".</p><p>And so it is. It may be mere gossip, no less enjoyable for that, that British and US officials – ie the state department and FCO – fretted that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/18/barack-obama-father-colonial-list\" title=\"\">Barack Obama Snr was just the type of Kenyan scholarship student</a> to \"fall into the wrong hands\" in America and emerge \"anti-American and anti-white\". Since his own dad, Onyanga Obama, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/dec/03/obama-grandfather-tortured here\" title=\"\">detained and possibly tortured during the Mau Mau emergency</a>, that's hardly surprising – as I have written before. President Obama seems content to overlook the offence; he has more important things to worry about.</p><p>But the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/18/archives-diego-garcia\" title=\"\">mistreatment  of the 1,500 citizens of Diego Garcia</a>, exiled in the 1960s to create the huge Indian Ocean military base so crucial to American global power projection, cannot be but a poignant story, heartlessly cruel and probably avoidable. Again, the initial injustice and expediency has been compounded by secrecy and obstruction.</p><p>Kenya, Cyprus, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/18/colonial-office-eliminations-malayan-insurgency\" title=\"\">Malayan  emergency in which British colonial forces inflicted a rare defeat on a communist-led jungle insurgency</a> – the files which have survived will still provide plenty of useful insights. Malaya fascinated the Americans, who tried and failed to repeat its counter-guerilla techniques (remember \"secure hamlets\"?) in Vietnam a decade later.</p><p>Yet context usually provides some mitigation for such actions, occasionally justification, which it is wise not to dismiss out of hand. Nothing reported in Wednesday's newspapers about British excesses would at first glance match what the Belgians did for decades in the Congo – Europe's worst colonial scandal,  the Germans in what is now Namibia or the French in Algeria, the legacy of whose imperial retreat lives on.</p><p>That's no excuse, but it is context. So is the atmosphere of the 1950s which I dimly remember, when Stalin's armies occupied the eastern half of Europe and word was slowly emerging of the scale of atrocity committed during and after the Terror and the second world war – 5 million Stalin victims in addition to the 20 million Russian dead at the hands of the Germans.</p><p>With China in Mao's hands we were all scared of what the \"red menace\" might be about to do to the rest of us. Paranoia was particularly acute in the United States of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism\" title=\"\">McCarthy  era</a>, when bad things were done in the name of liberty, but often mixed up with race. Ed Pilkington reported  only this week on the 40-year <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/16/angola-prison-forty-years-solitary-confinement\" title=\"\">solitary confinement of two black Americans</a> caught up in the tail-end of that madness and still protesting their innocence.</p><p>But just because it is easy with hindsight to condemn or mock the excesses of the time doesn't mean our parents and grandparents weren't right to be nervous – or even that the often-brutal suppression of the Malayan insurgency  didn't do modern Malaysia, conspicuously prosperous and relatively open, a historic favour. Just think about neighbouring Burma.</p><p>The cold war was often frightening and always corrosive, but it did have a point. Whether its peaceful ending in the collapse of the Soviet Union and its bloc after 1989 has ushered in better times or merely a relatively benign interlude remains to be seen. Edward Lucas's new book Deception (Bloomsbury, £20) suggests we are foolish to underestimate the continuing threat to Britain posed by Russian espionage – often conducted not by goons and oligarchs, but by modern young Russians with PhDs and nice accents. US worries about cyberwarfare focus on China, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/16/militarisation-of-cyberspace-power-struggle\" title=\"\">as Nick Hopkins reports</a>.</p><p>As Julian Assange's WikiLeaks exercise showed, though many readers were too indignant to notice, the cable traffic it revealed tended to expose more of the double-talk of the states Washington has to deal with than outright US perfidy. But the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/apr/18/colonial-papers-fco-transparency-myth\" title=\"\">condemnation of Britain's failings </a>by Harvard professor and author of Britain's Gulag (Holt/Cape), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Elkins\" title=\"\">Caroline Elkins</a>, does warrant a gentle riposte.</p><p>Her history of Britain's suppression of the Kenyan Mau Mau revolt – very brutal too in its own way – won a Pulitzer prize, though Oxford's David Anderson covered much of the same bloody ground in his Histories of the Hanged: Britain's Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire (Weidenfeld and Nicholson) in the same year of publication.</p><p>Most of this ugly stuff is known, it's often the context which is forgotten. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-poison-gas-tests-botswana\" title=\"\">Poison gas  tests in an isolated corner of Botswana</a>? They never actually happened, but Britain feared the Germans might use it first – as they did in 1915.</p><p>But Americans should always resist the easy temptation to take too much moral high ground over the Brits. They have their Kenyas and their Diego Garcias too and are usually as selectively amnesiac as we are. Thus, the predominantly black, southern city of Washington DC boasts a haunting Holocaust Museum. But when I looked at the bench on which Jews were not allowed to sit, I thought of the countless benches in the American south on which – in the same decade – African Americans were not allowed to sit either.</p><p>As for Native Americans, when I lived in the US I was often struck by how small were the newspaper archives discussing their continuing plight and problems, compared with those of African Americans. Some might see the whole country as their Diego Garcia.</p><p>So almost the last thing I did before returning to Britain was visit the Pine Ridge reservation – home of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre\" title=\"\">Wounded Knee Massacre  of 1890</a>. It is not a pretty sight. History is moving on and the west is slowly being judged for its failings as well as its achievements.</p><p>From here on others will be writing their own accounts of the past 500 years of European expansionism, now over. Some of them, I dare say, will be committing atrocities of their own against the weak too.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/18/1334750596339/British-troops-round-up-K-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/colonial-papers-ugly-legacy-empire","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/colonial-papers-ugly-legacy-empire","sectionName":"UK news"},{"webTitle":"Military spending: how much does the military cost each country, listed","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-16T23:10:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2012/apr/17/military-spending-countries-list","fields":{"body":"<p>Is the global arms trade recession-proof?

They want opportunities to help them pull themselves out of poverty. They need investment to build their businesses and create stable jobs. Using expert banking knowledge and new technology we will be able to kick start the engine of growth.</p><p>\"We have no chance of defeating global poverty unless we unblock commercial lending and allow entrepreneurs the chance to thrive in some of the most neglected parts of the world.\"</p><p>The plan involves strengthening banking systems in developing countries in the expectation that more capital will be available to people trying to start or expand businesses.</p><p>Mitchell said his proposal will be a solution to the problems faced by many small businesses in poor countries, which find obtaining loans difficult and expensive. Many banks, he believes, are often unable to judge the risks of investing, pushing up the price of finance. Fees for lending are three times as high in developing countries as in developed nations, while the average interest rate paid on a loan by a small business is almost 16%, about double the average for a rich country.</p><p>The facility will use a small pool of startup capital to help 35 banks and institutions in 15 countries in Africa and Asia, with the hope it will provide an additional £5bn of lending. All loans will be on a commercial basis, with a fast-financing facility to provide direct lending to SMEs that can prove an urgent need for investment to create jobs.</p><p>The proposal also envisages bringing in the latest techniques and technology  to modernise banking procedures. These will include state of the art psychometric credit scoring.</p><p>Lars Thunnell, chief executive officer of the IFC, said: \"Small and medium enterprises are a vital engine of job creation in developing countries. Yet they face a huge financing gap – especially in Africa, where SMEs need three times more funding than is currently available. This facility will help narrow the gap, creating opportunity for entrepreneurs who need it most.\"</p><p>The first 15 countries to benefit from the facility will be South Sudan, Malawi, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Tanzania, Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan.</p><p>The Department for International Development said that SMEs already employed two-thirds of the total permanent workforce in developing countries, but they remained constrained at a time when jobs need to be found for rising populations. It is estimated that Africa will require 10m jobs a year for the next decade to absorb the young entrants into the labour market.</p><p>Less than one third of all small businesses in Pakistan, Bangladesh and DRC had any deposit or credit account with banks, according to the department. Demand for credit by small businesses in countries such as Mozambique, DRC, Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria was thought to be at least seven times greater than the amount of loans available from banks.&nbsp;</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/4/15/1334509018132/Girls-sell-biscuits-and-o-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/apr/16/uk-funds-million-jobs-world-bank","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2012/apr/16/uk-funds-million-jobs-world-bank","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Inside Washington's high risk mission to beat web censors","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-15T15:29:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2012/apr/15/commotion-wireless-new-america-foundation","fields":{"body":"<p>For more than a year, the intelligence services of various authoritarian regimes have shown an intense desire to know more about what goes on in an office building on L&nbsp;Street in Washington DC, six blocks away from the White House.</p><p>The office is the HQ of a US government-funded technology project aimed at undermining internet censorship in countries such as Iran and Syria. And so every week – sometimes every day – email inquiries arrive there that purport to be from pro-democracy activists in those places, but which, the recipients are confident, actually come from spies.</p><p>This is international espionage at its most elementary: pretend to be a sympathiser, ask for more details, and just maybe, if you're lucky, some unsuspecting intern or temp will forward you the secret plans. It's a long shot, but it's much easier than intercepting phone calls, cultivating double agents or infiltrating opposition groups.</p><p>This kind of dissimulation has been going on forever. But if you wanted a sign of the strangeness of this moment in history, you could not hope for one more telling than this: the spies who email the L&nbsp;Street office always get their questions answered, promptly and in detail.</p><p>\"Everything is completely open – all the code, everything,\" says Sascha Meinrath, who runs the project, codenamed <a href=\"http://oti.newamerica.net/\" title=\"\">Commotion Wireless, at the New America Foundation thinktank</a>.</p><p>\"If it's a really good question, we'll put it on our frequently asked questions page. Hard questions help us get better.\"</p><p>The fact that Meinrath and his fellow geeks are committed to radical transparency is not surprising: that has been the ethos of grassroots internet culture since the beginning. (Meinrath used to work for <a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org/en/index.shtml\" title=\"\">Indymedia</a>, the citizen-publishing site that grew out of the Seattle World Trade Organisation protests of 1999.) But what certainly is a surprise is the fact that the US state department is providing such people with millions of dollars.</p><p>Such are the strange bedfellows of the era: on one hand, the US government is funding Commotion Wireless, which will enable anyone with a smartphone to connect with other smartphones, forming a \"mesh network\" – an impromptu internet – to communicate by stealth, regardless of efforts to monitor or shut down traffic.</p><p>On the other hand, the FBI recently distributed flyers warning that the use of \"anonymisers\", encryption or \"multiple cell phones\" might be \"indicators of terrorist activities\".</p><p>In January, Meinrath's team gave Commotion a trial run at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/30/occup-dc-protesters-standoff-police\" title=\"\">the Occupy DC encampment</a> – meaning the state department was effectively facilitating the protest.</p><p>Multiple fractious arguments about the internet dominate headlines these days, but ultimately they are all battles in a single war.</p><p>Debates about China's \"Great Firewall\", about WikiLeaks, about intellectual property and piracy, about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/02/email-surveillance-lib-dem-rebellion\" title=\"\">UK government's plans to expand email surveillance powers</a>, about Facebook and privacy, pornography and terrorism, Anonymous and LulzSec, all boil down to the fundamental question of whether the internet should be \"open\" – a place of unfettered expression, self-organising order and plenty of chaos – or \"closed\" and controlled, subjugated to existing frameworks of politics, policing and law.</p><p>Common sense might dictate some middle way, which is the official line of the Foreign Office: cracking down on criminals but not democracy activists; letting respectable businesses harness the web's potential, without letting copyright anarchists such as <a href=\"http://thepiratebay.se/\" title=\"\">the Pirate Bay </a>do the same.</p><p>But it is by no means clear that this is possible. Can you facilitate \"Twitter revolutions\" without also facilitating organised crime? Can you weaken dictators without weakening democratic governments? Can you support an open internet abroad but not net neutrality – which stops internet providers making it easier or harder to access certain sites – at home? Can you be open and closed as it suits you? Or must you make a choice?</p><p>For a certain breed of digital utopian, these were always supposed to be irrelevant arguments: eventually, they argued, the inherent logic of the internet would defy all efforts to control it.</p><p>Instead, China has not only developed a vast and highly effective system of censorship over its more than 500 million internet users – combining human and digital surveillance, and permitting closely watched clones of non-Chinese social networks to thrive – but is exporting its thinking and technology to other countries. UK and US firms, meanwhile, have been among those implicated in marketing surveillance technologies used to censor the web in China and Egypt. None of the easy assumptions of the technolibertarians – that the democratic world would champion openness, or that openness would win – any longer seem to apply.</p><p>Nowhere are the dilemmas and the possibilities better illustrated than in the case of the US state department, which under Hillary Clinton has become a full-throated supporter of \"internet freedom\" as a human right – while simultaneously trying to avoid the impression that it is fomenting regime change in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, American allies that heavily censor the web. (And also while opposing that other pioneer of internet freedom, WikiLeaks, with its penchant for leaking secret state department cables by the truckload.)</p><p>\"We want to keep the internet open for the protester using social media to organise a march in Egypt,\" <a href=\"http://secretaryclinton.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/secretary-of-state-hillary-clintons-speech-on-internet-freedom/\" title=\"\">Clinton said</a> in a major policy speech last year. \"[For] the college student emailing her family photos of her semester abroad; the lawyer in Vietnam blogging to expose corruption; the teenager in the US who is bullied and finds words of support online; for the small business owner in Kenya using mobile banking to manage her profits; the philosopher in China reading academic journals for her dissertation … internet freedom is about defending the space in which all these things occur.\"</p><p>Between 2008 and 2011, Congress authorised $76m (£48m) of spending on such efforts – a sign of serious intent, though admittedly very little compared with the forces it is intended to fight.</p><p>The ethos of openness was central to the vision of the internet's founders – academics, mainly, who trusted each other and were not focused on the network's global growth. \"The primary design principle underlying the web's usefulness and growth is universality. When you make a link, you can link to anything,\" its founder, <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=long-live-the-web&amp;print=yes\" title=\"\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee, wrote in 2010</a>, in a polemic targeted just as much at the \"closed worlds\" of Facebook and the Apple App Store as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/05/iran-clamps-down-internet-use\" title=\"\">at Iran's \"Halal internet\".</a></p><p>\"Totalitarian governments aren't the only ones violating the network rights of their citizens,\" Berners-Lee said, citing a 2009 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/21/nicolas-sarkozy-france-illegal-downloading\" title=\"\">French law</a>, which in its original form would have allowed the authorities to cut off a household's internet access for a year based on nothing but a media company's claim that its copyright had been violated. (Now, a court must agree as well.) \"Given the many ways the web is crucial to our lives and our work, disconnection is a form of deprivation of liberty,\" Berners-Lee added.</p><p>In practice, though, even well-meaning efforts at openness can aid those who seek to exert tight controls over the internet. That seems to have been the case with the fiasco of Haystack, a project launched amid the 2009 Iranian election protests by a US programmer, Austin Heap, which promised to allow dissidents in Iran to circumvent state censorship.</p><p>The state department endorsed the project (and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/mar/29/austin-heap-megas-innovator-award\" title=\"\">Heap won a Guardian innovation award</a> for his efforts) but Haystack was abruptly withdrawn amid allegations that its poor design exposed activists to possibly fatal harm, revealing information about them to Iran's state monitors. \"Given that history, it's not that [activists] are paranoid,\" says Meinrath. \"It's just good sense – the history is that when we've done these things, it's been very bad!\"</p><p>The radical openness of Commotion is an effort to prevent a rerun of those problems. Anyone can inspect the code, testing it for flaws. Being exposed to the prying eyes of foreign governments means it must adapt to withstand such scrutiny; those using it can accurately grasp the risks, and need not rely on faith in America's goodwill, or on software developers keeping certain things secret. \"Instead of trying to hide security problems, we're trying to actively expose them,\" says Meinrath. \"It makes for better relations with people who are going to be putting their lives on the line.\"</p><p>Last year, when the New York Times mentioned Commotion, Iran's intelligence minister, Heidar Moslehi, declared that his country had devised ways to sabotage the project. But the logic of the internet has a strange way of frustrating such strategies. \"We got flooded with messages from people in Iran wanting to know how to download it,\" Meinrath said. \"He did more to spread word about our technology than we ever could have done.\"</p><p>And once a handful of people have downloaded it in any given location, its spread – should they find it useful – is virtually guaranteed. When completed, Commotion could allow demonstrators to plan their real-world gatherings free of state interference.</p><p>Used in conjunction with a \"delay-tolerant\" Twitter application, it could let people continue to use the social network despite censorship. Then, as soon as any node on the network managed to connect to the wider internet, it could push out all backlogged tweets for the world to see.</p><p>Another project receiving state department backing is a \"panic button\" app for smartphones, called InTheClear, which allows the contents of a phone to be speedily erased, and prewritten texts sent to specific contacts, when the owner is taken into custody.</p><p>But many of the \"internet freedom\" dollars go towards digital workshops held globally – some publicly acknowledged, but most secret – at which more than 5,000 activists have so far been trained.</p><p>\"One blogger was a Tunisian and he'd been active before the revolution, before Ben Ali left,\" a senior state department official said at a briefing, explaining one benefit of the workshops. \"And when he got to the training programme, the trainer looked at his laptop and found that he had scores of viruses on his laptop, including … keylogger software [that] was sending back every single stroke he typed.\"</p><p>Scepticism about such efforts is widespread. \"The impression I have, to be honest, is that [the internet freedom agenda] is mainly a public relations thing,\" says the Cairo-based Middle East analyst <a href=\"http://www.arabist.net/amrani/\" title=\"\">Issandr El Amrani, founder of the news and commentary site Arabist.net</a>. \"It's a big idea that comes at relatively low cost. And while the administration has been helpful in Syria\" – condemning Syrian web crackdowns, and energetically using Facebook and other networks there itself – \"we haven't seen Clinton or Obama push aggressively for internet freedom in China. We haven't seen any real efforts to ban the export of software to let governments spy on citizens.\"</p><p>In its public pronouncements about its activities, Washington toes a careful line, insisting that \"internet freedom\" is a politically neutral human-rights effort, not a way of undermining authoritarian regimes – some of which, after all, are officially allies.</p><p>\"The biggest negative critique of the state department in this area is built entirely around a straw man,\" insists Alec Ross, Clinton's senior adviser on innovation. \"It's rooted in this false premise that we view this principally as an engine for regime change in authoritarian societies. It's just a false critique.\"</p><p>To the internet commentator Clay Shirky, by contrast, America's interest in using internet freedom to undermine autocracies is \"acknowledged internally and understood externally. It's just that nobody can come out and say it.\"</p><p>In the end, though, it may not matter who acknowledges what, or how the state department views things: the forces they are helping to unleash are inexorably exposing the contradictions in how democratic governments approach the question of online openness.</p><p>\"It's very difficult to weaponise social media,\" says Shirky – to choose the battles you want to wage, so as to support openness in Iran, say, while overlooking abuses in South Korea or Thailand, and not aggravating the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), for whom a free and unmonitorable internet is less a human right and more a grave business threat.</p><p>Shirky says: \"The real threat to internet freedom isn't from Iran saying we're going to disconnect and build an alternate internet – that's a desperate act. The real threat comes from the <a href=\"http://www.mpaa.org/\" title=\"\">MPAA</a> [Motion Picture Association of America] and our allies. We should be much more worried about what's going on in South Korea than in North Korea.\"</p><p>In the utopian version of this storyline, by collapsing governments' abilities to promote freedom in some countries but not others, or in the political realm but not the commercial one, openness may force governments to pursue a more principled kind of politics.</p><p>\"We've always been able to say 'oh no, we don't mean you, Saudi Arabia,'\" said Shirky. \"And now our bluff has been called.\"</p><p>Sitting in the wood-lined rare books room of the state department library, Alec Ross, a 40-year-old West Virginian who was closely involved in Obama's presidential campaign, before being hired by Clinton, dismisses many of these criticisms, but paints internet freedom in similarly grand historic terms.</p><p>\"I think the fight over an open internet is today's version of a battle between open and closed that has been raging now for 2,300 years,\" he says, sketching a sweeping tale of clashing forces dating back to the third century BC, taking in the burning of the library at Alexandria, the invention of the number zero, the dark ages and the impact of the printing press.</p><p>In this view, the crusade for openness rises above mere politics.</p><p>\"What distinguishes the Bush 'freedom agenda' from Clinton's internet freedom agenda is that [Clinton's] is less politically deterministic. It's rooted in individual rights, not a presumed political outcome. There are lots of grantees of ours whose members have political views that would be well outside the mainstream in this room. But that's a good thing!\"</p><p>Clinton says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/27/hillary-clinton-ready-for-rest\" title=\"\">she will step down</a> this year, but America's role in the open internet's future may just be starting to get interesting.</p><p>If the promise of neutrality is not kept – if the policy is used instead only to further narrow US interests – then it could alienate pro-democracy activists and harm US credibility abroad.</p><p>On the other hand, if the promise is kept, it could unleash forces of openness too great for any nation to control, and with no guarantee that movements thus empowered will be friendly to America. Commotion Wireless may prove to have been presciently named.</p><p><strong>• Explore the seven-day special series on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/battle-for-the-internet\">Battle for the internet</a></strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/4/15/1334501605114/Anti-government-protester-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/15/commotion-wireless-new-america-foundation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2012/apr/15/commotion-wireless-new-america-foundation","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Translators fight the fatal effects of the language gap | Mark Tran","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-11T06:00:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/11/volunteers-translation-language-health-messages","fields":{"body":"<p>Lori Thicke had an epiphany in Thange in eastern Kenya when she saw Aids orphans playing in front of posters with advice on Aids prevention. \"The posters carried excellent advice, but they were in English, a language that people didn't understand,\" she said.</p><p>What was the use of this information provided by well-meaning NGOs, she wondered, if the people they were trying to reach could not read English. \"People are delivering aid every day in Africa in English, French and Portuguese,\" said Thicke. \"That is fine for the educated elite, but they don't need aid. It is the parents among the poor who need the information on symptoms of malaria.\"</p><p>She saw the fatal effects of the language gap in India too, where mothers could have saved their children from dying from diarrhoea if they had followed the simple advice on health brochures and leaflets.</p><p>Thicke, a Canadian who came to Paris to write the great Canadian novel but founded a translation company instead, had pinpointed a glaring but little-noticed paradox in the information revolution. Thanks to the internet and mobile phones, knowledge and information is disseminated far and wide and at speed. But that knowledge is wasted unless understood by those who need it most.</p><p><a href=\"http://translatorswithoutborders.com/\" title=\"\">Translators without Borders</a> was founded by Thicke and Ros Smith-Thomas in 1993 after Médecins sans Frontières, the medical NGO, asked her company, Lexcelera, to work on a translation project. She asked if they needed translation often, and if giving them the words for free would be like a donation. They said yes to both questions, and TWB was born. But until that moment in Kenya two years ago, the group dealt mostly with European languages. Now Thicke is determined to bridge what she calls the \"language last mile\" in the developing world.</p><p>One of the group's current projects is to teach sex workers in the Kibera slum of Nairobi, Kenya, to translate material in English on sexually transmitted diseases into languages such as Swahili, Luo and Kikuyu. The project started last week, with Simon Andriesen, a specialist on medical translation who is on the TWB board. He will teach about 125 women from Kibera, who speak different languages, to translate four-page brochures in English into the different Kenyan languages.</p><p>\"He is teaching them translation skills so they can reach their own people,\" said Thicke. \"All the girls from Kibera represent different languages. They have been recommended to us by a health NGO and their job is to pass on information to other girls. We want to provide brochures in a language that can be understood so it doesn't get thrown away.\"</p><p>Paul Warambo, a recent masters graduate in the Kiswahili language living in Nairobi said: \"The health translators training has come at a time when the country urgently needs translators in every sector, but especially in the health sector where little information is available in languages that can be understood by the majority of Kenyans.\"</p><p>TWB is working on an even more ambitious project with Wikipedia. The aim is to take <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MED/Translation_project\" title=\"\">Wikipedia entries on the most important health topics</a>, turn them into simple English and then translate them into as many languages as possible. The articles will then be accessible for free on mobile phones through new agreements between Wikimedia, which runs Wikipedia, and telecoms operators. A number of Wikipedia articles covering dengue fever, Aids, malaria, cholera and tuberculosis are awaiting translation from TWB's army of volunteers.</p><p>The group has about 2,000 translators, who have passed its translation tests. Indian languages are well served but Africa is a big gap, with only about 15 of TWB's translators able to deal with African languages. Africa has more than 2,000 different languages, such as Amharic, Swahili and Berber, spread across <a href=\"http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/Default.aspx?Contenttype=ArticleDetAD&amp;tabID=63&amp;Aid=2164&amp;moduleId=390\" title=\"\">six major language families</a>. Nigeria alone has more than 500 tongues spoken within its borders.</p><p>Until the 2010 Haiti earthquake, TWB had limited reach. But the crisis revealed not only the need for translations from thousands of aid groups that need humanitarian translations but also a critical mass of translators willing to help.</p><p>So the group created an online platform to bring the two communities together. Last year, ProZ.com, the world's largest translator organisation, created an automated translation centre for TWB so it could broaden its reach. Approved NGOs can now post translation projects such as field reports, treatment protocols and websites. Alerts then go out to the translators in those language pairs. Those who are interested in the work of that particular NGO will take on a project, translate it, and return it to the platform for delivery. Most of the projects are picked up within 15 minutes.</p><p>Translators without Borders can easily handle projects for 100 non-profits at a time, but as its volunteer community grows, so does its capacity. Over the years, it has donated almost $3m in translation services, which means that money went towards medical supplies, vaccines, rehydration kits and more.</p><p>\"We are working to build a world where knowledge doesn't have borders,\" Thicke said. \"With technology, and cellphone penetration in Africa, we have the potential to spread knowledge, but no one is talking about how people are getting information even if they are connected. People die not just of disease but from a lack of knowledge on how to avoid getting sick.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/4/10/1334076490619/The-hand-of-a-sick-child--004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/11/volunteers-translation-language-health-messages","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/11/volunteers-translation-language-health-messages","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"David Walter obituary","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-02T14:55:42Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2012/apr/02/david-walter-obituary","fields":{"body":"<p>Gentleness and self-effacement are not usually qualities associated with either politics or journalism, but the Liberal Democrat politician, broadcaster and writer David Walter, who has died of cancer aged 64, was characterised by both. Though he never realised his ambition of getting into either of the houses of parliament, he played a key role in training other Lib Dems in how to handle media interviews.</p><p>Potential parliamentary candidates would often be caught out by being \"doorstepped\" outside the party's former Westminster headquarters in Cowley Street by David, microphone in hand, asking the most aggressive and topical question possible as their reactions were captured on film. This was a bit of out-of-character play-acting he relished, though afterwards he would deconstruct their performance kindly and give pointers as to what they could have done better.</p><p>The advice was based on many years of experience working at the heart of broadcast news and current affairs at ITN, Channel 4 and the BBC, variously as newsreader, presenter and part of a production team. He was ITN's political correspondent before moving on to work on a range of serious-minded BBC programmes for television and radio, including Newsnight, Panorama, On the Record and the now defunct Eurofile, a weekly Radio 4 round-up of major European stories, whose demise David much lamented.</p><p>He was an enthusiastic European; the job he enjoyed most during his career was his stint as the BBC's Paris correspondent. In all this professional work he had to remain politically strictly neutral, of course, despite holding strong Liberal Democrat convictions. It was therefore something of a relief to him when he left broadcasting to become the party's communications director (1998-2003), helping them develop their messaging as well as preparing Lib Dem figures for appearances on Question Time, Any Questions and so forth.</p><p>David's deep interest in politics and international affairs was almost predestined by his origins. He was a descendant of John Walter, founder of the Times. David's father, Basil, worked in the colonial service, notably in Nigeria. David was nonetheless born in Newcastle and educated in England, winning scholarships to Charterhouse, Surrey, and Trinity College, Oxford, where he studied classics. He was president of the Oxford Union and was later awarded a Kennedy Memorial scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>He was thus admirably qualified to stand for a winnable parliamentary seat once the shackles of his broadcasting neutrality were removed. His chance came when <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/john_burnett/torridge_and_west_devon\" title=\"\">John Burnett</a>, MP for the marginal Liberal Democrat constituency of Torridge and West Devon, announced his intention to stand down at the 2005 general election. David's main connection to Devon was through his wife, Pamela, whom he had married in 1970. Burnett's predecessor had been Emma Nicholson, who initially held the seat as a Conservative but defected to the Liberal Democrats and subsequently was elevated to the peerage. When the Tories seized back the seat at the 2005 election, it was a bitter disappointment and David was not minded to try again. But he found some compensation in becoming the highly respected chair of his local party in the Lib Dem-controlled London borough of Kingston, where the impish sense of fun and love of gossip lurking behind his strait-laced facade was much appreciated.</p><p>Through his party connections, David was able to further his international interests by working on short-term projects for the government-funded <a href=\"http://www.wfd.org/\" title=\"\">Westminster Foundation for Democracy</a>, which aims to enable capacity-building for political parties in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Russia, Kenya and Tanzania. He also built up his own media consultancy, First Take, which became the prime focus of his professional activities after he left the Lib Dem HQ.</p><p>In 2008, he was a member of the jury of the <a href=\"http://www.rts.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Television Society</a> awards. He was proud of his role as president of the <a href=\"http://www.themediasociety.com/\" title=\"\">Media Society</a>, a charity that campaigns for freedom of expression and encourages high standards in journalism. Over the years he wrote for the Guardian, the Times, the Daily Telegraph, the Economist and the New Statesman.

He thinks this will work with water as well. That's the theory. I wonder if you think it's a good idea?</p><p>Clay does not like to do things by halves so he is also looking for $1 billion to rehabilitate degraded land – 100m hectares by 2020 and 250m by 2030. </p><p>To put this into context, Brazil has already targeted to reclaim 25m hectares by 2020 and China, Ethiopia and South Africa have already done more than 1m hectares each.</p><p>He's finding it difficult to raise the money because the business case is not yet proven so he is looking for public funds to pare down the risks so that private funders with a long term horizon, such as pension funds will then come in.</p><p>He talks about the importance of 'patient capital.' There wasn't much patient capital around in the last 20 years ago, so if you come across some, do get in touch with him.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">8.38am:</span> Gordon Brown will be on at 9am so it will be interesting to see if he responds to the Lords committee recommendation that the government should abandon its spending target for development aid and instead concentrate on stamping out corruption and ensuring it gets value for money from what it does spend.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">8.50am:</span> There is an interesting debate at Skoll about why institutions fail to support innovation. It's mainly because they need certainty, which of course is the opposite of true innovation.</p><p>Here is an example of the debate taking place.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">8.58am:</span> I will be chairing a session at lunch time today on a CARE initiative, spun out into a social enterprise, that has poor women earning an income by selling a basket of products to those at the base of the pyramid -  in other words other poor people. Soap may be a good idea but what about Unilever's skin lightening cream. Should NGOs encourage women to sell the products of multinationals?</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.12am:</span> Gordon Brown running a little late but should be on soon</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.19am:</span> </p><h2>Relentless optimism</h2><p>The Skoll World Forum is not the place you want to be if you are feeling depressed as you would probably end up feeling suicidal. That's because there is a relentless optimism pervading the event. It's clearly the American in us all.</p><p>In principle that is a great thing because we need to believe in the art of the impossible if we are going to overcome the many challenges in the world. But this also needs to be counter-balanced with some realism. </p><p>There is plenty of talk here of learning from the failures, but I wonder how open the delegates are to talk about their own failures? Being positive is a great quality. So too is recognising and working through our suffering.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.21am:</span> Got it slightly wrong on Gordon Brown's timing. He is one after Nick Danziger, the photographer and film maker. One of his most recent projects is Missing Lives, about people who went missing during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.28am:</span> Nick Danziger talking about his life through pictures. People in Afghanistan had risked their lives to keep him safe, but on his return to London he only had local clothes to wear and immediately suffered racial abuse</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.34am:</span> Nick Danziger sets depressing note about lives for women in the developing world, being forced into prostitution, not allowed to work or go to school.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.36am:</span> Nick Danziger says that even though some countries are trumpeting meeting the Millenium Development Goal of universal primary school education, this is being achieved only by huge class sizes while teachers often do not not even have chalk to use on blackboards.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.43am:</span> Nick Danziger says we always think about facts and figures but need to look for spiritual truth as well, showing photos of the Dalai Lama.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.47am:</span> Today in Kabul only about a dozen women drive a vehicle, but Nick Danziger says this would have been unheard of a few years ago. He shows picture of a woman driving in Kabul but points out that she needs to be protected by an armed guard when she is on the road.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.03am:</span> Pamela Hartigan, director of Skoll Centre, talks of the power of stories. We use stories to learning from our past and look to the future. </p><p>She says she is an optimist despite all the negative changes in the world - natural disasters: earthquakes, floods, typhoons, nuclear disaster, the financial crisis, sovereign debt crisis, rising cost of resources, and climate catastrophe.</p><p>Yet humans have shown the ability to create positive change. She points to the anti-nuclear movement, the women's movement, the anti-apartheid movement, the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement.</p><p>Optimistic because \"I have spent my life hanging out with creative and positive people who managed to punch well above their weight and saw opportunities for transformation.

There is no reason we cannot find a solution.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.16am:</span> Gordon Brown says he has been around the world looking at schools. Go to Indonesia and see people begging to go to school, go to Kenya to see 1m children queuing up to go to school when it becomes possible. For those children who cannot go to school you see the death in their eyes</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.19am:</span> Gordon Brown says education the best way of breaking the cycle of poverty.</p><p>When ask children what they want to be, they want to be nurses and doctors and scientists etc</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.22am:</span> Gordon Brown says we need to end the discrimination about children going to school. He tells those eating chocolate easter eggs to think that the cocao comes from countries where millions of children have to work to produce it. This must be outlawed.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.23am:</span> Gordon Brown says 90% of disabled children in the developing world do not go to school but new technology exists to help make this possible.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.24am:</span> Gordon Brown says we need to work with governments to convince them to take the issue of education seriously. Nigeria has 9m children who do not go to school, but the country has the resources to help. Technology has the ability to help them deliver this.</p><p>Millions of children do not go to school because governments have broken down. We need a Medecins Sans Frontiere for the education world. He is therefore forming Education Without Borders.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.26am:</span>  Gordon Brown says it is a moral duty to protect the children of the world.</p><p>The motto for this Olympics is a Tennyson poem : 'To strive to seek to find and not to yield.' He says this represents the desire to move things forward and make a difference.</p><p>He says, however, that Tennyson's final poem was not optimistic and William Gladstone responded in a literary magazine and said Tennyson, you have got this all wrong. Go back to your first poem about the wonder of how the world could be.</p><p>Gladstone gave the example of the education reforms in England that had allowed all children to go to school. </p><p>Brown said this is what could now be replicated across the world.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.28am:</span> Gordon Brown has now finished but just to recap; he is launching an organisation called Education Without Borders.</p><p>He also talked about education not just being a moral duty, but would also help the security of the world by stopping fundamentalist schools from spreading.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.49am:</span> Eve Ensler, the playwright and creator of the Vagina Monologues is now speaking. She says it is much better to give money away rather seek to own money or people as this generates new energy and the possibility of change. Happiness comes from supporting movements of solidarity rather than seeking to take control.</p><p>She learnt this from giving away the rights to the Vagina Monologues which allowed the play to be performed all over the world.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.57am:</span> In the universe everything is created by intent, says Eve Ensler.</p><figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/juliahobsbawm/status/185302565922156545\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>OK scientists, here is the brief: biologically create @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eveensler\">eveensler</a> in all of us immediately.

Because change is slow, he says, it is vital to have long-term relationships with suppliers for them to have the confidence to become more sustainable.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p>McDonald's Europe says too early to see the impact on sales from its partnership with the Marine Stewardship Council but it offers the marketing people the chance to talk about fish again, which will then create more support from customers.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.19pm:</span> Do corporates keep a lot under the radar because companies are worried that cynics will attack them?</p><p>McDonald's says corporates are more confident about being open and realising it is a journey and they do not always have to meet targets.</p><p>PepsiCo says the company has gone through difficult economy but despite that, they have shown continued support for their Purpose programme.</p><p>What about the fact they sell products that are not healthy?

Christine Schuler Deschryver is the director of the City of Joy in Congo, a place for women to go when they've been brutalised by acts of violence that beggar belief. </p><p>Fahima Hashim is the director of Salmmah Center in Sudan, battling similar circumstances. Eve Ensler is a playwright and co-founded V-Day for Congo with Schuler Deschryver.</p><p>So, ok, you don't need to be told that rape is bad, and you don't need to be told that women are strong. In the Congo, people say that rape is being used as an act of war, expressly, civil war: but the situation is quite different in south Sudan, where rape is written into the constitution, just by dint of being indivisible from adultery, so that any woman accusing a man of rape is automatically punished as an adulterer.</p><p>In Somalia, it's different again – women are silenced, from the way Adan describes it, more by the culture of taboo around sexual violence, which they're left vulnerable to in the first place by the fact that they arrive in Mogadishu, very often, driven there by the drought, without men.</p><p>They're put up in the most basic of shelters, with no protection. Rape is not about sex, it's about violence: but it struck me, listening to these stories, that in these awful situations where the crime is rife, isn't not really about the sexes, either. It's not about men who hate women; it's about men who object to civilisation, to cooperation, to progress. It's an act of violence against humanity. The co-director (with Ben Affleck. But he's not here…) of the Eastern Congo Initiative, Whitney Williams, said \"I really see it as a sign that the social fabric has been ripped\".</p><p>To the social entrepreneurs, listening to this, the pressing question was where to start: you can invest in women, and Ensler kicked off by saying \"If I were an investor, and I had money, I would invest in conflict zones. I would invest in the women in conflict zones.\" </p><p>Williams echoed this with a story about the success of a cocoa plant she'd raised some investment for. But I sensed a certain discomfort about the order of things – how happy you could be, investing in a women's project in a place where women aren't even protected by the rule of law, and women's security doesn't even extend to being able to walk down the street.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.53pm:</span> Roberto Artavia, CEO of the Social Progress Initiative, says that when you look at the 99% movement in the US, it shows there is a significant proportion of the population in the richest part of the world who think the system is breaking down.

Most of them do not have formally recognised addresses, which makes it difficult to send and receive goods. An address can enable local stores to rise above poverty by connecting their business to a larger market. TNT's commitment to act as a socially responsible company triggered TNT Express, one of the world's express delivery companies, to explore the possibilities of using mobile phones to optimise slum deliveries.</p><p>A team of colleagues from TNT Express collaborated with slum residents to study existing supply chains. Results showed that the main challenges lie in recognising address locations and enabling secure payments but that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) could offer opportunities for improvements. As a consequence, TNT Express' Corporate Responsibility department developed a solution for slum deliveries. Working under the umbrella of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) Technology Enablers Initiative (TEI), over a six-month period, TNT Express worked with Vodafone to explore how best to merge logistics with telecommunications. Because of the limited time frame and funds, the priority was to raise awareness about the issues and contribute to the development of sustainable supply chains in the future.</p><h2>Receiving a parcel is complex business</h2><p>An address is very common in today's developed world. It is a key element of our identity and enables us to live normal lives. So what happens when one does not have an address? Chris, a student who lives in Kibera in Kenya, the second largest urban slum in Africa, answers: \"One million people live in Kibera, but we do not have addresses. So when I ordered a second-hand camera to use in my business as a journalist, I could not receive the package directly. I had to walk to the nearest postal office at a 3.5km distance. And not just once, I did not know when the package would arrive, so I had to walk back and forth regularly. And you know the people who live in Kibera have little money, so when a package arrives, we have to bribe the local authorities to ensure the package gets to the right recipient.\"</p><p>The main challenges for slum deliveries are the lack of formal addresses, the maze-like infrastructure and the unreliability of payments upon delivery. Take another example used in the study conducted by TNT Express. The city of Dharavi near India's financial capital, Mumbai, has become a booming economic hub. The city has an annual turnover of $650m from exports and imports worldwide. Thousands of packages are delivered daily in Dharavi, which leads to high congestion. Still, deliverymen find their way through the maze via landmarks and asking for directions. The congestion is still manageable, but if the economy keeps growing, there will definitely be a need for designated delivery points.</p><p>Most businesses in Dharavi export their products worldwide, but local manufacturers lack the connection with an international network of customers. Therefore, they use middlemen to bridge the gap between the low-cost local production and the international demand, who receive an estimated 60% of the profit. Ecommerce has appeared as a potentially good alternative to avoid middlemen. Online presence is still in the early stages of development, but some businesses already have a website or online business card on Dharavi's website. Electronic payments are crucial, as a local student explains: \"India still very much has a cash payment culture. So if, let's say, I want to make a deal with a customer in Italy via the Internet, how can I be certain I will be paid if I send him the goods? And how do I receive the money?\"</p><h2>Mobile phones - the 'addresses' of the future?</h2><p>ICT can play an important role in overcoming such challenges through the rise of mobile phone connections and mobile banking. The collaboration between TNT Express and Vodafone led to the design of phones that recognise a mobile phone number as an address location and enables secure payments via <a href=\"http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/about/about_us/money_transfer.html\" title=\"\">Vodafone's M-paisa</a>.</p><p>The research in Dharavi showed that the mobile-based delivery service lowers congestion and enables local stores to expand their market without involving middlemen who walk away with most of the profits. Still, full-scale implementation of such a service is a future perspective. More market research and high volumes of transactions via ecommerce are required to make a viable business case. Monitoring technological and social developments will prepare us for the future, and building partnerships and a real 'can do' mentality will bring us there.</p><p><em>Copy on this page is provided by the </em><a href=\"http://www.wbcsd.org/templates/TemplateWBCSD5/layout.asp?MenuID=1\" title=\"\"><em>World Business Council for Sustainable Development</em></a><em>, sponsor of the </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/rio-2012\" title=\"\"><em>Business on the Road to Rio hub</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/23/1332514431812/mobile-phones-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/delivery-slum-business-mobile-phone-address","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/delivery-slum-business-mobile-phone-address","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"Tobacco atlas: country by country","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-23T13:09:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2012/mar/23/tobacco-industry-atlas-smoking","fields":{"body":"<p>A devastating audit of the tobacco industry has been published showing that despite nearly 50m deaths in the last century due to tobacco use, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/22/tobacco-profits-deaths-6-million\">industry is gaining bigger profits</a> than ever before. </p><p>Almost 6m people died in 2011 due to tobacco use, with around 80% of the deaths occuring in low and middle-income countries according to the <a href=\"http://www.tobaccoatlas.org/\">tobacco atlas</a> published by the American Cancer Society and World Lung Foundation.

It comes in a week when UNICEF and World Health Organisation (WHO) <a href=\"http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/JMP-report-2012-en.pdf\">announced</a> that the millenium development goal on drinking water access has been met ahead of time.</p><p>The goal for clean is described <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG%20Report%202010%20En%20r15%20-low%20res%2020100615%20-.pdf#page=60\">in detail on the United Nations website</a> but in simple terms the target is to: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking-water and basic sanitation</p></blockquote><p>The WHO and Unicef <a href=\"http://www.wssinfo.org/about-the-jmp/introduction/\">joint monitoring programme</a> (JMP) for water supply and sanitation, has been gathering data to measure the goal. They found that between 1990 and 2010 more than 2 billion people gained access to improved drinking water.</p><p>As you can see from the JMP chart above - that 2 billon people has halved the number of people without access to safe drinking water.  </p><p>That means that 89% of the world population, or 6.1 billion people, had access to an improved source of drinking water in 2010.</p><p>But is the JMP measure of the drinking water situation fair? </p><p>There is some suggestion that the  measure doens't take into account the large amount of variation between countries. </p><p>As the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lizford\">Liz Ford</a> has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/mar/06/water-millennium-development-goals\">noted</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The report said huge regional disparities existed. Almost half of the 2 billion people who have gained access to drinking water since 1990 live in China or India. Meanwhile, many countries in Africa are not on track to meet the target by 2015, with some countries actually falling back to pre-1990 rates of coverage. More than 40% of all people globally who lack access to drinking water live in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></blockquote><p>This variation is clear from the JMP map:</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-387982383'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/22/1332419792410/World-map-MDG-water-001.jpg' alt='World map MDG water' width='460' height='306' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>World map.

competition can save lives through shared value","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-20T12:15:33Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/blog/developing-countries-healthcare-creating-shared-value","fields":{"body":"<p>Imagine a future where companies that make drugs, vaccines, and medical devices compete to save lives where those innovations are needed most – locations such as India and sub-Saharan Africa. That future is closer than you think. <a href=\"http://www.novartis.com/\" title=\"\">Novartis</a>, for example, has built a profitable business, <a href=\"http://beyondprofit.com/tag/arogya-parivar/\" title=\"\">Arogya Parivar</a>, that serves 42 million rural Indians in 10 states that earn $1 to $5 per day.</p><p>Until just a few years ago, most pharmaceutical and medical device companies saw philanthropy as the only viable way to contribute (and many global health stakeholders agreed). Certainly, this approach has helped people in need. Pharmaceutical companies gave almost $3.5bn to developing countries in 2009. But that figure pales in comparison to the size of the problem. Philanthropic approaches are also difficult to scale unless ever greater generosity prevails.</p><p>In contrast, and as a testament to new shared-value thinking, companies like <a href=\"http://www.novonordisk.com/\" title=\"\">Novo Nordisk</a> are competing to save lives. In China, Novo has saved 140,000 life-years by investing in local health systems. In the process, the company has built a profitable $1bn insulin market.</p><p>From 2011 to 2015, spending on pharmaceuticals is expected to grow by 14% in low and middle-income markets. North America and Europe are forecast to grow at a mere 4% over the same period. The picture is similar for the medical device market.</p><p>Last week, some 100 pharmaceutical and medical device company representatives and global health stakeholders heard from Harvard Business School professor Michael E Porter and others that this shift is real and growing. At the <a href=\"http://www.fsg.org/creatingSharedValueinGlobalHealth.aspx\" title=\"\">event</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fsg.org/\" title=\"\">FSG</a> launched its new research report on <a href=\"http://www.fsg.org/tabid/191/ArticleId/557/Default.aspx?srpush=true\" title=\"\">shared value in global health</a>. The report features 10 case studies and many more examples of companies that are innovating to meet the needs of new customers in India, China, South Africa, Kenya, Cambodia, and other countries.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.fsg.org/tabid/191/ArticleId/557/Default.aspx?srpush=true\" title=\"\">report</a> examines how firms are creating shared value on three distinct levels. <a href=\"http://www.healthymagination.com/\" title=\"\">GE</a> is reconceiving its products, such as its $500 portable electrocardiogram device, to make them more affordable and less complex. <a href=\"http://www.healthymagination.com/\" title=\"\">Pfizer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gsk.com/\" title=\"\">GSK</a> have reconfigured their value chains through a new, jointly-owned company – <a href=\"http://www.viivhealthcare.com/\" title=\"\">ViiV Healthcare</a> – that combines compounds owned by both firms to create a viable pipeline for new HIV medicines. <a href=\"http://www.bd.com/\" title=\"\">Becton Dickinson and Company</a> is strengthening local clusters (local health systems) by building the capacity of developing-country laboratories that will become customers for their devices and diagnostics.</p><p>The trend toward shared value in global health is still in its early stages. Developed world markets will account for the majority of pharmaceutical and medical device company profits for some time to come. Likewise, some health needs will remain beyond the reach of business for many years. But these boundaries are shifting, and as companies learn and innovate, new opportunities will emerge at an ever-faster rate.</p><p>At last, health technology companies are viewing patients in low- and middle-income countries as customers to be competed for, rather than simply beneficiaries of, philanthropic largesse. These patients stand to benefit enormously as a result.</p><p><strong>Read the full report: </strong><a href=\"http://www.fsg.org/tabid/191/ArticleId/557/Default.aspx?srpush=true\" title=\"\"><strong>Competing by Saving Lives: How Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Companies Create Shared Value in Global Health</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.fsg.org/AboutUs/OurPeople/KylePeterson.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Kyle Peterson</em></a><em> is a managing director at </em><a href=\"http://www.fsg.org\" title=\"\"><em>FSG</em></a><em>.

In a light, airy room situated in the shadow of the city's looming Croke Park stadium, two dozen schoolgirls in matching navy blue jumpers sit attentively on coloured beanbags. The room is lined with bookshelves. High up on one wall there are a series of framed posters entitled \"Ten Rules for Writing Fiction\", compiled by different well-known authors. In Anne Enright's rules, there is the warning: \"Only bad writers think that their work is really good.\" Number One in Richard Ford's list is: \"Marry somebody you love and who thinks you being a writer's a good idea.\"</p><p>The girls, aged eight, nine and 10, are not at that stage quite yet. They gaze around the room wide-eyed, cowed into silence by the excitement of unfamiliar surroundings and a morning off school.</p><p>\"Does anybody know why you are here this morning?\" asks a woman standing at the front.</p><p>A tentative hand goes up. \"To write a story,\" comes the reply from a pupil called Sophie.</p><p>\"That's right – and we're here to help you.\"</p><p>The girls' legs jiggle in anticipation. This is <a href=\"http://www.fightingwords.ie/\" title=\"\">Fighting Words, a workshop </a>set up by the author Roddy Doyle in 2009 to encourage creative writing in students of all ages across Ireland. Since its inception, the centre has seen several thousand come through its doors. The majority are from local primary schools in Ballybough, an economically deprived area of Dublin, but other students have travelled hundreds of miles. Fighting Words, which relies largely on volunteer staff and offers all its lessons free of charge, has proved so popular that sessions are booked up a year in advance. \"The interest is huge,\" says Sean Love, the executive director and co-founder. \"We're obviously filling a gap that is not filled in formal education.\"</p><p>In a climate of arts cuts and economic gloom, the centre relies on private donations to keep going – its operating costs are about ¤300,000 a year (£250,000). To this end, Fighting Words is about to issue a hand-printed, collector's edition of short stories written by Annie Proulx, Colm Tóibín, Joyce Carol Oates and Salman Rushdie among others. It is hoped that the sale of the book will raise enough for the centre to stay open for a further two or three months.</p><p>Within 20 minutes, today's group has chosen (via a scrupulously conducted vote) a main character for their story called Dude the Vampire. They are then encouraged to invent a sidekick (Blackie the Bat) before coming up with a plot and dialogue for their characters, which is typed up by a volunteer on a laptop and projected onto a large screen so that everyone can read it. Rose, a final-year art student, is on hand to draw illustrations.</p><p>The collective method of writing throws up some interesting suggestions. When asked what Dude the Vampire's greatest wish might be, a small girl in the front row with long dark hair, held back by a sparkly pink scrunchie, puts up her hand. \"He wants to eat a monkey,\" she says.</p><p>There is a gentle laugh from a bespectacled man in a leather jacket, sitting unobtrusively at the back of the room. The man is Roddy Doyle, the Booker prize-winning novelist whose first novel, <em>The Commitments</em>, caused a sensation on its publication in 1987. Doyle went on to become one of Ireland's most prolific and beloved writers: every Dublin taxi driver I meet has read at least one of his books. \"I'm not recognised that much,\" Doyle insists. \"I'm just a bald man in glasses and there's a rash of them in Dublin. It'd be different if I had a mohican.\"</p><p>When Doyle established Fighting Words, the intention was not only to inspire children and young adults who might otherwise be struggling with literacy to write, but also to regenerate a down-at-heel part of the city where many children do not have English as their first language, and which had provided the backdrop for several of Boyle's own books.</p><p>The centre, which takes its name from a common Dublin expression meaning words used to advance an argument, was also partly a response to a lack of creativity in Doyle's own education. The Christian Brothers who ran his secondary school gave him no encouragement to write fiction. For years, Doyle simply assumed he didn't have the talent or discipline to put pen to paper. Today's children, he says, deserve better.</p><p>\"When I was growing up, the exam system didn't allow you to write fiction, so you never did,\" he says. \"There was an absence of thought [about creative writing] which seems daft in retrospect.\" Doyle didn't start writing regularly until he became an English and geography teacher in his 20s. \"I didn't have the discipline until then.\"</p><p>The discipline of writing, he explains, is particularly important for the young people who come here. \"It's the freedom to challenge your mind, to admit failure and then to start again. Schools don't really allow failure and yet it's a valid part of any endeavour, not just writing.</p><p>\"I think this…\" Doyle gestures to the group of schoolgirls now sitting bent over desks, attempting to write their own endings to Dude the Vampire's story, \"opens their heads to the value of their own decisions and willpower to rewrite. It's about working hard to make something good enough. That's the deep satisfaction.\" He mentions a group of young women who came in after being on a government work scheme. \"They'd been failed by the education system,\" says Doyle. \"They didn't think they could write. But I can see the difference from when they first come in – it's visually apparent – and it's a quick transition from thinking 'I can't do anything' to 'I can do something'.\"</p><p>As Sara Bennett, manager of Fighting Words, puts it: \"I can see kids' imaginations sparking. We offer a space to be free to be creative.\"</p><p>Part of the centre's success derives from the quality of the teaching. Doyle, a father of three whose work includes several children's books, can relate easily to the students and lives round the corner. He is a frequent presence, as is fellow Booker winner, Anne Enright. The patrons of Fighting Words include illustrious literary figures such as Colum McCann, Maeve Binchy and Lorrie Moore.</p><p>\"Everybody here's very nice about my writing,\" says 17-year-old Hannah Gaden Gilmartin, who has been coming to Fighting Words' weekly drop-in sessions for young adults for the last 18 months. \"Sometimes I just get a general idea and I want it to work with certain characters, so I'll just start writing and Roddy Doyle or whoever is here to help out will come and look at what I've done and make some suggestions and then I get on with it. It's always very constructive advice, phrased in a helpful way.</p><p>\"It's a good opportunity to be creative. There's not really the opportunity to do creative writing at school. Writing makes me feel excited. Even if it's going really well, you're looking forward to doing the next bit, to the next scene coming up. I think I do want to be a writer when I leave school.\"</p><p>Hannah is currently hard at work on her first novel – a fantasy with a protagonist called Jan. She's \"not 100% sure yet\" what is going to happen. According to Doyle, the majority of stories produced at Fighting Words are: \"A never-ending battle between love and violence.\" Even with the eight-year-olds? He smiles. \"Especially with them.\"</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was a trip to visit his friend the author Dave Eggers in America that inspired Doyle to start Fighting Words. In 2002, Eggers had founded <a href=\"http://826valencia.org/\" title=\"\">826 Valencia, a non-profit organisation</a> to help children and young adults develop writing skills, in the Mission District of San Francisco. The centre, built behind a shop selling \"pirate supplies\" such as tubs of lard and eye-patches, offers free workshops and field trips as well as publishing an array of student-authored literary journals. It has been such a success that it now has seven more chapters in the US and has inspired projects as far afield as Australia and Kenya.</p><p>Doyle wanted to do something similar and started looking for premises. An estate agent took him to a disused office space near the famous Croke Park stadium and it was this building that would become a state-of-the-art creative writing centre in the heart of the city. Fighting Words was the first centre of its kind in Europe and saw 11,000 children through its doors in the first 17 months, but similar initiatives have sprouted up in its wake, including the <a href=\"http://www.ministryofstories.org/\" title=\"\">Ministry of Stories in London</a>, brainchild of author Nick Hornby and art entrepreneurs Ben Payne and Lucy Macnab.</p><p>Like Fighting Words, the Ministry of Stories, which opened in 2010, chose for its location a city neighbourhood caught between deprivation and regeneration – Hoxton, east London. Funded by the Arts Council, the Ministry is fronted by a shop selling \"monster supplies\" (a jar of \"thickest human snot\" being a prime example) and has formed a link between disparate, co-existing communities: the young professionals in technology start-ups bustling around Old Street; the well-off residents of gentrified Georgian housing; and those that live in nearby council estates, afflicted by one of the highest rates of child poverty in the country. It was also a part of London badly affected by last summer's riots.</p><p>The effect of such projects is, by its nature, difficult to quantify but Macnab believes that the process of a child sitting down to write a story, then giving them a copy of their published work, can have enormous impact on a young person's self-worth.</p><p>\"We're encouraging and motivating young people to write and have confidence in their voice. I think writing and being able to express oneself is really vital for being able to take part in society,\" she says. \"There's a confidence that comes with getting it right. And then there's the social nature of talking about writing, where people are enthusiastic about listening to you and seeing your work honoured and respected and enjoyed by others. All of those things are important.\"</p><p>Key to this is getting children engaged in the first place. Although Doyle has no pirate or monster merchandise on offer at Fighting Words, he and Sean Love did introduce some \"anarchic\" elements of their own, including an unseen editor called Editor McConkey who is famously grumpy and makes comically disparaging remarks to the students through a frosted window in one of the bookshelves. The playfulness is crucial in getting introverted, sullen or nervous children engaged.</p><p>Today, Editor McConkey's avowal that \"Girls can't write stories\" has already been met with a shrieking chorus of disapproval. At the end of the session, Editor McConkey will admit that he was wrong before handing out a printed booklet of \"Dude and Blackie's Plan to Destroy the World\" to each pupil. One third of the story is left blank for the children to fill in their own endings.</p><p>The girls are clearly thrilled. \"In my ending, Dude destroys the world but then he's lonely,\" says one of them, shiny-eyed. \"So he brings the world back again with a special weapon.\"</p><p>\"For these children, writing is important – even to the ones who don't read a lot,\" says Doyle. \"The idea that they'll have their name on a book means everything to them. Whereas if you put it on the internet, it doesn't mean anything.\"</p><p>Love agrees: \"Getting a book for them is a huge moment. The physical object is important.\"</p><p>This reverence for the physical object itself is reflected in Fighting Words's latest fundraising drive: <a href=\"http://www.stoneyroadpress.com/\" title=\"\">a limited-edition, hand-printed book</a> comprising 10 specially commissioned 800-word short stories by some of the world's leading writers, plus an exclusive etching by the Irish-American Turner prize nominee Sean Scully. Each of the 150 copies has been individually signed by the authors – Proulx, Tóibín, Oates, Rushdie, Enright, Russell Banks, John Banville, Richard Bausch, David Mitchell, and Sam Shepard – and will sell for ¤1,950 (around £1,625). It is a mark of how highly Fighting Words is regarded (and a measure of Doyle's charm) that the compilation has attracted such notable contributors.</p><p>\"We sat and made a list of the people we most wanted and because of their great generosity, we didn't have to go far beyond the original 10,\" says Doyle. \"The hardest thing was actually getting the stories delivered to people to sign.\"</p><p>The stories, printed on oversized pages of blotting paper thickness, were not the kind of thing you could pop in a letter-box. Instead, they were carefully packed into slim wooden containers and shipped, complete with pencil, for the authors to sign. \"The worst to get to was Annie Proulx,\" recalls Doyle. \"She said she lived down a lane. When you say 'a lane' in Ireland, it's 25 yards. A lane in Annie's case was 47 miles through snowy ravines in Wyoming.\"</p><p>There was no set theme for the stories submitted and no restrictions other than word count. Proulx has written about last year's floods in Australia. Banville's story is about his time working the night-shift on a newspaper. Oates's tale revolves around a soldier returning from Afghanistan.</p><p>Back in the classroom at Fighting Words, it is tempting to wonder how many of these young girls will go on to become world-famous writers. At the end of their session, they file out onto the street shepherded by teachers.

In spite of many years of humanitarian aid and development, it remains a major challenge to ensure access to water for all people. The sustainability rate on water projects in developing countries is alarmingly low, due to a lack of resources, capabilities and spare parts for service and maintenance.</p><p>With the Grundfos LIFELINK solution, the Danish pump manufacturer Grundfos is applying its core competencies in solving the challenge of providing sustainable access to water for rural and peri-urban communities in the developing world. The company has developed a solution for sustainable water projects that not only includes modern pump technology driven by solar energy, but also a sustainable model for ongoing financial management and technical service. Through an innovative payment system based on mobile banking the water revenue is automatically collected and finances the ongoing service and maintenance, which is carried out by a local team of professional service technicians. Thereby, Grundfos LIFELINK is providing a self-sustaining model for water projects in rural and peri-urban areas of the developing world.</p><p>It might sound simple, but in reality it is a new paradigm in delivering sustainable water supply to the people who need it the most, and it shows the potential of business in providing innovative solutions for sustainable development. Through partnerships with the government of Kenya, the UN, Danida and other development organisations, 50,000 people in rural and peri-urban areas of Kenya now have reliable access to safe water from a LIFELINK system. This means a radical improvement in quality of life for the community members, and furthermore, it has brought about new livelihood opportunities in the communities where people start small businesses with water distribution, growing crops, or investing in livestock.</p><p>Based on the experiences in Kenya since 2009, Grundfos LIFELINK is now expanding to other countries across Africa and looking towards Asia and Latin America in the coming years.</p><p><em>Copy on this page is provided by the </em><a href=\"http://www.wbcsd.org/templates/TemplateWBCSD5/layout.asp?MenuID=1\" title=\"\"><em>World Business Council for Sustainable Development</em></a><em>, sponsor of the </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/rio-2012\" title=\"\"><em>Business on the Road to Rio hub</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/3/7/1331137928384/A-child-with-a-palmful-of-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-water-access-grundfos-lifelink","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-water-access-grundfos-lifelink","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"The world's undersea internet cables - interactive","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-28T14:41:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/datablog/interactive/2012/feb/28/undersea-internet-cable-map-interactive","fields":{"thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/8/2/1312304701092/digital-cables-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/datablog/interactive/2012/feb/28/undersea-internet-cable-map-interactive","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/datablog/interactive/2012/feb/28/undersea-internet-cable-map-interactive","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"East Africa internet access slows to a crawl after anchor snags cable","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-28T13:07:33Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2012/feb/28/east-africa-internet-access-anchor","fields":{"body":"<p>The old theory that a butterly flapping its wings can cause a hurricane on the other side of the world may be somewhat far-fetched.

The discussion helped shape our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/audio/2012/feb/27/fair-trade-podcast\">fair trade podcast</a>, and some readers' questions were put directly to the panel. Have a look at some of the contributions to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/feb/01/fair-trade-ethical-debate-fairtrade\" title=\"\">our talk point</a> and let us know what you think.</p><p>From <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/14448520\" title=\"\"><strong>RodneyNorth</strong></a>:</p><blockquote><p>We think that the Fair Trade certifiers made a big mistake in the 90s when they extended the certification to large plantations … plantations – no matter how well managed or benign – do not belong within Fair Trade. Paying higher wages, improving work conditions etc are certainly laudable, but we do not believe they rise to level of \"Fair Trade\". Besides, our observations have been that Fair Trade has not proven to be an effectual tool in plantation settings. That is not a surprise as it was not conceived to solve the serious social, economical, and legal problems confronted on plantations and other large estate farms.</p></blockquote><p>From <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/14468502\" title=\"\"><strong>AngelaMarker</strong></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Fair trade is a great start but falls short in many ways. Firstly, it misses many small-scale producers that lack the resources/funds/opportunities to become fair trade producers. Secondly, we are afraid some companies use the fair trade label as just that, a superficial label to give an ethical stamp of approval whilst falling failing to live up to standards in many other areas.</p></blockquote><p>From <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/14451334\" title=\"\"><strong>Hopeweaver</strong></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Ethical shopping is one of the few growth areas in recent times, as more people feel disillusioned with the old ways of doing things. Travel is opening people's eyes not only to the beauties of the world, but also its inequalities and there is a growing desire to do something about it. Modern technology has given birth to communities of like-minded people from all over the world via various social media, and the gentle drip messages – allied to the support of strangers who believe in what is being done – encourages and promotes ethical ways of doing business.</p></blockquote><p>From <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/14454946\" title=\"\"><strong>lauriejlee</strong></a>:</p><blockquote><p>One of the typical criticisms is: \"It's not the way to eliminate extreme poverty. It will only ever benefit a few people. There are more important things to do.\" But Fairtrade isn't claiming to be the single answer to poverty. It shouldn't be tested against that standard. There is NO single solution to extreme poverty after all. It's not trying to solve every problem. But it is benefitting more than 6 million people in 60 countries worldwide and with only very minor support from aid. That's a really cost effective contribution to development.</p></blockquote><p>From <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/14464125\" title=\"\"><strong>Bonnybear</strong></a>:</p><blockquote><p>To get the full price these producers need to add value and make quality products that consumers want to buy. However, while producers are kept at the bottom of the chain they will struggle to grow economically and to earn profits beyond the Fair Trade floor price. This situation is going to take a generational change of mind set to improve, but perhaps (and maybe I'm being too optimistic here) the rise of BRICs in the next few decades will bring about these changes that the \"rich\" nations of the northern hemisphere just don't appear to be able to stomach.</p></blockquote><p>From <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/14532058\" title=\"\"><strong>Coomy</strong></a>:</p><blockquote><p>\"In 2010, I visited two coffee co-ops in Kenya and Tanzania, the Nairobi coffee exchange and one major distributor in Tanzania to see if Fairtrade had any positive impacts. The Kenyan co-op did not want to get involved in FT as they saw much greater benefits in going into the speciality/direct market. The other, a major co-op in Tanzania, was considering axing their FT affiliation because of the $20,000 per year it cost them to be accredited, and the farmers there, several of whom I spoke to, saw minimal benefit. The local distributor said that while FT does benefit workers on large commercial farms, in that it guarantees a minimum standard of rights and working conditions, it rarely benefits small farmers. The small premium, while guaranteeing a base level of income slightly higher than market rates, offers no incentive to improve farming skills, nor any guarantee that farmers will be educated to improve the quality output of their crop, or the sustainability of their locality.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think?

The government has pledged to bring that down to \"tens of thousands\".</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Although the numbers of people coming into the country are up by about 2% on the previous year, the reason the balance has grown may be more due to the 1.2% drop in people emigrating. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/feb/23/net-migration-britain-record-levels\">Alan Travis writes today</a> that </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The figures for the first year of the coalition government showed that net migration actually rose from 235,000 to 250,000 in their first 12 months in office. This increase was driven by falls in the emigration side of the equation, with the number of people going to live abroad at its lowest level since 1998.</p></blockquote><h2>Where do people come from?</h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>The International Passenger Survey estimates shows India as the top country for people coming to the UK with 11.9% of all immigrants. It's followed by Pakistan, (5.8%), Poland (5.4%), Australia (5.2%) and China (5.2%). That has changed a lot since the early-1990s, as the animation above shows, when Germany was the top country.

And if you look at them quarter by quarter, 2011 saw a rise.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The figures show how asylum applications are affected by world instability. In 2010 and 2011, Iranians made the most asylum applications; in 2009, it was Zimbabweans. </p><p>However, recent  unrest in Libya has led to a \"substantial increase in asylum applications from Libyan nationals in the period January to September 2011 (672 applications compared to 62 between January and September 2010), although numbers of applications fell during the fourth quarter of 2011 to just 49\". </p><p>Syrian applications have gone up too - from 127 to 353 between 2010 and 2011.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>We've extracted the 2011 asylum seeker figures so far <a href=\"#asylum\">below in a sortable table</a>.</p><h2>People removed from the country </h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>Removals statistics have been <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/immigration-brief-q4-2011/removals\">falling</a>.

When excluding port removals, there has been a 12% fall in the total number of people forcibly removed or departing voluntarily in 2011 (down from 41,968 to 36,970); this fall has been affected by the decreased numbers of assisted voluntary returns and other voluntary departures, particularly in the first and second quarters of 2011 respectively.</p></blockquote><p><strong></strong></p><h2>Why people come here</h2><p>In the year to June 2011 the estimated number of long-term migrants whose main reason for entering the UK was work-related was 185,000 - 22% lower  than the peak of 239,000 in the year to June 2008.

href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/jul/20/un-declares-famine-somalia\">UN formally declared famine</a> in two regions of Somalia. <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/grow/pressroom/reactions/un-announcement-declaring-famine-parts-somalia-must-be-urgent-wake-call\" title=\"\">Oxfam said</a> the announcement marked a \"catastrophic breakdown of the world's collective responsibility to act.\" A number of questions followed: could aid donors have responded earlier? Why didn't they? Is the media to blame? Why does 'famine' compel more attention than 'humanitarian emergency'? Could the crisis have been averted?</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/03/famine-somalia-over-says-un\">UN formally declared the famine over</a> in early February 2012, and similar questions followed: Will the decision to downgrade the crisis in Somalia from 'famine' to 'emergency' levels effectively downgrade public engagement, and effect the ongoing relief effort?</p><p>We set out to explore some of these issues, and used data on aid flows, media coverage, web searches and Twitter traffic to build an interactive looking at how donors, news organisations, and the public engaged with the crisis in Somalia before, during, and after the famine.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-388084341'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/22/1329917174602/somaliablogimg.jpg' alt='asd' width='460' height='238' class='gu-image'/><figcaption><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/interactive/2012/feb/22/somalia-famine-aid-media-interactive\">Click through to explore the interactive based on this data</a></figcaption></figure><p>Data on humanitarian aid flows to Somalia in 2011 and 2012 comes from the UN's Financial tracking service (FTS) database. Each of the 584 donations recorded were then coded based on the type of donor. We opted for categorising donors primarily by geographic region, in part to explore the role and impact of \"non-traditional\" funders from areas such as the Middle East. Note that FTS compiles data based on reports from donors and agencies making appeals, and so is subject to reporting and recall errors.</p><p>Media coverage is measured by the number and the total length of articles published either in print or online by six mainstream news outlets in the US and UK: The Guardian, The Times, The Sun, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal. We used Factiva to look for articles that discussed the humanitarian crisis in Somalia before, during, and after the famine, and verified our results using the online archives of each publication. When there was a contradiction between Factiva and the online archives in terms of wordcount, we opted for the higher of the two.</p><p>Data on Google searches comes from the Google Insights online research tool. Peaks represent the highest number of searches in proportion to overall search traffic. Data on Twitter mentions comes from @PeopleBrowsr Datamine, who looked for tweets that contained mentions of Somalia and either famine, food, or drought.</p><p>Overall the interactive shows it is the declaration of famine, rather than forecasts and early warnings, which seizes attention. More than 70% of funding, and almost 90% of mainstream US and UK media coverage (based on our analysis of 6 major news outlets) came after UN famine declaration in July 2011.</p><p>Public engagement, estimated by Google searches and Twitter mentions, followed similar trends. This was curious, as these are quite different online activities. Data on searches measures individual interest in information on the crisis. But Twitter encompasses networks, and while tweets originate from individual accounts, those watching can choose to join a conversation or pass information onto their wider circle.  In this case, however, Twitter seemed to merely react to the famine declaration, and only briefly.</p><p>Note that while each measure of the world's response - aid flows, media coverage, Google searches, Twitter mentions - follows a similar pattern, we can't tell what relationship exists between these elements. We can't tell, for example, whether increasing media coverage fuelled, or responded to, rising aid flows.</p><p>There are also other questions that could be explored using the data we've compiled. It would be interesting, for example, to use the data on media coverage to look systematically at how exactly different news organisations covered the crisis. How many articles feature Somali voices? How many focus on the UK or US aid effort? What kind of language was used to talk about the crisis? The <a href=\"http://www.ibt.org.uk/all_documents/research/EastAfricanfamine.pdf\" title=\"\">media has been criticised</a>, for example, for focusing on the Dadaab refugee complex in neighbouring Kenya, for using graphic imagery, and for ignoring the wider context. It would be interesting to use this data to explore these arguments.</p><p>The full data behind the interactive is <a href=\"#data\">below</a>.

This is why Unesco has noted that radio is a \"low-cost medium, specifically suited to reach remote communities and vulnerable people\".</p><p>Attention given to technology for information communications has recently been captivated by web-based applications, especially \"new\" or \"social media\". But about 65% of the world's 7 billion people do not use the internet. In addition to those who are offline due to lack of access, there are also those who are unaware, unable or simply do not want to use social media.</p><p>People listen to the radio in their cars, on the move and at work. Radios don't require large amounts of electricity, and wind-up radios don't need an electrical source at all. Moreover, radio reaches large groups of people, being easily shared among families or listener groups. It is a medium often used as a focal point for community discussion on subjects including politics, elections and service provision. Radio efficiently reaches large audiences in real time. But can radio – a one-way broadcast platform – ever replicate the participatory impact of Twitter, Facebook or Google+?</p><p>Different technologies are changing the ways in which radio is used as a platform for engagement. At the end of last year, <a href=\"www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/facts/2011/material/ICTFactsFigures2011.pdf\" title=\"\">the ITU 2011 report</a> revealed that there are almost 6 billion active mobile phone subscriptions. The ubiquity of mobile technology presents an exciting opportunity even for those in \"last mile communities\" to interact with radio shows using a tool they already have.</p><p>Take \"<a href=\"http://www.organicfarmermagazine.org/tof/radio_shows\" title=\"\">The Organic Farmer</a>\" in Kenya, for example. The radio show gathers questions from its listener community of agriculturalists. On one occasion, reports surged in via text message about a disease affecting chickens in the area. In response, the radio show invited an expert to analyse the crowd-sourced evidence, diagnosed the cause as \"Newcastle disease\" and helped to organise vaccinations.</p><p>Similar to social media, the most important aspect of successful radio programming is participation. Seeking feedback from listeners helps to generate and guide content, which in turn increases local relevance and stimulates dialogue. Radio stations are increasingly reliant on audiences to be their eyes and ears, as they seek new tips to mobilise journalists who report from the field. More importantly, this enables more people to have a voice in the discussions that affect them. Mobile interaction \"closes the loop\", enabling audiences to listen to a discussion, contribute insight, and then hear their views encourage additional participation.</p><p>This may include challenging decision makers or service providers, which can be particularly powerful when feedback is democratically obtained. Pamoja FM has used listener input to challenge water cartels in Kibera, Kenya; <a href=\"http://breezefmchipata.com/\" title=\"\">Breeze FM</a> in Zambia has held discussion on its \"Issue of the Day\" programme about upcoming elections; and Malawi's Mudzi Wathu FM has taken health questions from listeners to ministers, and relayed the answers on air.</p><p>Calls are a powerful way of getting opinions across – but there's only so much airtime. For those who can't get through, SMS is a digital and asynchronous way for listeners to express themselves, and this increases engagement. For example, DJs can ask listeners to respond to SMS polls, enabling them to get many points of view without requiring significant airtime. When using software such as <a href=\"http://www.frontlinesms.com/\" title=\"\">FrontlineSMS</a>, this can be automated and visualised, making these real-time interactions easy to understand and rebroadcast. Over time, radio stations can use this kind of digital data to analyse audience behaviour and the popularity of different shows.</p><p>In a \"Twitter like\" way, radio, combined with the ubiquity of mobile, can be a platform for community discussions that change people's lives. Radio stations are being called upon to embrace new technology, but it is fundamentally important to make use of tools that are available locally, engaging people on the platforms they already use. As radio stations and tool providers all over the world are discovering, it is possible to do smart things with dumb phones.</p><p><em>• Amy O'Donnell is radio project manager at FrontlineSMS</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2012/2/13/1329132616796/People-listen-to-the-radi-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/feb/13/world-radio-day-celebrating-unsung-hero","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/feb/13/world-radio-day-celebrating-unsung-hero","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"A new model for sustainable water supply in the developing world","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-08T12:37:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/grundfos-lifelink-sustainable-water-access","fields":{"body":"<p>More than 1 billion people around the world have no access to clean drinking water. In spite of many years of humanitarian aid and development, it remains a major challenge to ensure access to water for all people. The sustainability rate on water projects in developing countries is alarmingly low, due to a lack of resources, capabilities and spare parts for service and maintenance.</p><p>With the Grundfos LIFELINK solution the Danish pump manufacturer <a href=\"http://www.grundfos.com/\" title=\"\">Grundfos</a> is applying its core competencies in solving the challenge of providing sustainable access to water for rural and peri-urban communities in the developing world. The company has developed a solution for sustainable water projects that not only includes modern pump technology driven by solar energy, but also a sustainable model for ongoing financial management and technical service. Through an innovative payment system based on mobile banking the water revenue is automatically collected and finances the ongoing service and maintenance, which is carried out by a local team of professional service technicians. Thereby, <a href=\"http://www.grundfoslifelink.com/\" title=\"\">Grundfos LIFELINK</a> is providing a self-sustaining model for water projects in rural and peri-urban areas of the developing world.</p><p>It might sound simple, but in reality it is a new paradigm in delivering sustainable water supply to the people who need it the most, and it shows the potential of business in providing innovative solutions for sustainable development. Through partnerships with the Kenyan government, the UN, Danida and other development organisations, 50,000 people in rural and peri-urban areas of Kenya now have reliable access to safe water from a LIFELINK system. This means a radical improvement in quality of life for the community members, and furthermore, it has brought about new livelihood opportunities in the communities where people start small businesses with water distribution, growing crops, or investing in livestock.</p><p>Based on the experiences in Kenya since 2009, Grundfos LIFELINK is now expanding to other countries across Africa and looking towards Asia and Latin America in the coming years.</p><p>To see more about the initiative, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JwwKaZUukY\" title=\"\">here's a video about the Grundfos LIFELINK</a>.</p><p><em>Copy on this page is provided by the </em><a href=\"http://www.wbcsd.org/templates/TemplateWBCSD5/layout.asp?MenuID=1\" title=\"\"><em>World Business Council for Sustainable Development</em></a><em>, sponsor of the </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/rio-2012\" title=\"\"><em>Business on the Road to Rio hub</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/8/1328704567850/Child-at-a-water-pump-in--003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/grundfos-lifelink-sustainable-water-access","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/grundfos-lifelink-sustainable-water-access","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"Surveillance trade shows: which government agencies attend?","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-07T12:05:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2012/feb/07/surveillance-shows-attendees-iss-world","fields":{"body":"<p>The surveillance industry trade shows, for example <a href=\"http://www.issworldtraining.com/\">ISS World</a> run by <a href=\"http://www.telestrategies.com/\">Telestrategies</a>, are <strong>the</strong> place to see who's buying and selling intelligence gathering equipment. </p><p>At ISS World you can view surveillance gear and attend <a href=\"http://www.issworldtraining.com/ISS_WASH/\">seminars</a> titled \"WIRETAPPING understanding the basics\" and \"The Basics of Weaponized Information\".  </p><p>But how much do we know about these shows? </p><p>Wikileaks and <a href=\"https://www.privacyinternational.org/\">Privacy International</a> have released the <a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/the-spyfiles.html\">spy files</a> that brought together brochures and other marketing material for almost 160 intelligence contractors - all in one place.</p><p>Now we have another piece in the surveillance industry puzzle.

agencies from each country said to be attending ISS World, and the number of agencies.</p><p>As you would expect, agencies tend to visit shows nearer to their offices which goes some way to explaining why American agencies are prominant: the conferences covered in this dataset are Dubai in 2007 and 2008, Washington DC in 2006, 2007 and 2009, and Prague in 2008. </p><p>Here's the <a
