Mine came last week at Keble College, Oxford, when I sat down next to a beardy scientist whose name-tag identified him as Craig.</p><p>'What do you do, Craig?' I asked.</p><p>Craig, it turned out, sequenced the human genome.</p><p>Later, I chatted to someone called Nick, who claimed it 'might be quite simple' to ensure that couples never fell out of love. 'Perhaps with a small pill to moderate our hormones,' he explained. 'We can already do it with prairie voles.'</p><p>Nick has a strong German accent and a nervous manner but then, as a woman called Shannaz tells me confidentially: 'The problem with some of the people here is that they're so brilliant they're almost retarded.' I suspect she's just trying to make us both feel a little better.</p><p>'Here' is TED, which is a conference. Sort of. Actually, it's quite difficult to describe precisely what TED is. It stands for Technology, Entertainment &amp; Design, but it's about more than any of those subjects. What it resembles most closely is a G8 of the mind, a high-powered ideas fest that crosses disciplines and ideas in what the New York Times calls 'three-and-a-half days of intellectual soul searching'. According to technology magazine <a href=\"http://www.redherring.com\">redherring.com</a>, it attracts 'some of the smartest, richest and most talented people on earth' and the stated aim, this time round, was to find 'Ideas Big Enough to Change the World'.</p><p>Which sounds, well, if not hopelessly ambitious, faintly implausible. But almost everybody does seem to have a big idea. In fact, some of them are huge. How to solve global poverty using mobile phones. How to finance manned space travel. How to live for ever.</p><p>Over four days, 39 main speakers, most of whom are world leaders in their field, compress their ideas into 18-minute-long whiz-bang talks before a slightly stunned-looking 300-strong audience. If it all sounds suspiciously unBritish, it's because it is. TED was set up in America in 1984 and since 1990 has been held annually in Monterey, California.</p><p>But last week's event, TEDGlobal, was the first time it's ever been attempted in Britain, part of a masterplan to make it less American and more international.</p><p>It costs &pound;2,500 to attend (not including flights and hotels), and even then it's invitation-only (you can apply, but you're not necessarily going to be accepted). In 1984, it introduced the world to the first Macintosh computer and the first CD-rom. It spawned the magazine Wired and the academic institution that became the accelerator of the digital age, the MIT media lab.</p><p>It's regularly attended by the likes of Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch, Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon, and Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin (there used to be something called the Millionaires' Dinner held on the eve of TED, but a few years back they were forced to rename it the Billionaires' Dinner). In between, the talks are performances by musicians such as Thomas Dolby, who was instrumental in introducing the synthesiser into pop, and Talvin Singh. And then, after that, there are parties. TED is less a conference, more an avant-garde cultural 'happening' as staged by the masters of the universe.</p><p>The self-styled 'curator' of TED is Chris Anderson, an Englishman who made a fortune with Future Publishing and set up the Sapling Foundation, whose mission is to 'leverage the power of ideas, media and markets' into life-sustaining projects, mostly in the developing world. Three years ago, he bought TED from Richard Saul Wurman, the flamboyant entrepreneur who founded it, and turned the whole thing into a non-profit venture with somewhat worthier aims. On the first day of the Oxford conference, he leaps on stage and, in a slightly earnest, 'Thought for the Day'-type voice, says West Coasty things like: 'Let the magic happen' and: 'It's all in the conversation.'</p><p>But it probably all is in the conversation, because the conversations are amazing. It's just that they're all conducted at a scarily high level. A sampling of the speakers (none of whom is paid; they come because they want to be there) includes Richard The Selfish Gene Dawkins; the founder of online encyclopaedia Wikipedia, Jimmy 'I'm trying to bring the entire sum of human knowledge to within the grasp of the entire population of the world' Wales; architect William 'Did I tell you that I'm designing seven entirely sustainable Chinese cities from scratch and the Chinese government has just adopted my teachings as state policy?' McDonough; Aubrey 'There is no reason why within the next 10 years we can't figure out how to extend the lifetime of the people sitting here to 150 years and within that 150 years, we'll figure out how to extend it to a 1,000 years' de Grey, a Cambridge geneticist; Afghanistan's finance minister, Ashraf 'I'm rebuilding my country's infrastructure, but let me tell you it's pretty tricky because you lot are so bloody selfish and just don't give a damn' Ghani; and David 'There are about a trillion parallel universes out there and I've got the proof' Deutsch, an Oxford physicist.</p><p>There is, inevitably, a lot of crazy scientist hair going down. De Grey has the best beardy look - ZZ Top meets Gandalf - although my favourite mad scientist is Deutsch, who explains the 'multiverse' with a rather touching confidence that I'll understand: 'In most of these parallel universes, there will be jet aeroplanes, although in the universes in which dinosaurs didn't die out, they will be dinosaur jet aeroplanes.'</p><p>'Does that mean that there is another universe in which there is somebody who looks like me and has my name but understands quantum physics?' I ask him.</p><p>'Yes,' he says. 'There is.'</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, the conference has a knack for introducing the world to the Next Big Thing. This time round, gadget-wise, it may or may not be, a weird little wi-fi rabbit whose ears light up and swivel around and that is apparently the first step towards us 'communicating via objects'.</p><p>It's a wireless means of being connected to the internet 24 hours a day or, as the man from the French manufacturer tells me: 'It will read you the news, or the traffic report, or your emails. And if you marry your rabbit to another one, they can send each other love letters.' It costs 60 quid and will be available in Britain in September. 'It doesn't have to be a rabbit, though,' he says. 'It could be a coffee table.'</p><p>'Your coffee table would be able to talk to you?'</p><p>'Yes,' he says. 'It could teach you Italian.'</p><p>The unique thing about TED is that the audience is almost as high-powered as the speakers. Everyone has a big red name tag, most of which include the words 'President', 'CEO' or 'Professor'. Mine says 'Carole Cadwalladr' and has a big blank next to it.</p><p>On the last day, I meet someone else with a blank. 'You're a blank!' I say. But it turns out he's an Arctic explorer called Ben Saunders.</p><p>'Everywhere else, people ask me why I do what I do,' he says. 'But here no one asks. They just accept it because they're all like that. They're all passionate about what they're doing.'</p><p>He's right, they are. And it's infectious. In a single, mind-blowing session, I listen to Craig Venter, the genome man, explain how he's on track to create an entirely new species out of synthetic DNA within two years, arguably one of the, if not the, greatest biological breakthrough of all time. Then Eve Ensler, who wrote The Vagina Monologues, tells how a single woman supported by her V-Day foundation has prevented 4,500 genital mutilations in Kenya, and Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal, showed a slide of how our sun would look when it dies, 'as viewed by an organism that is as different from us as we are from bacteria'.</p><p>In one coffee break, I bump into Dawkins, wearing an 'Evolution is the Greatest Show on Earth' T-shirt, and Peter Donnelly, professor of statistics at Oxford. 'What do you make of this?' I ask them.</p><p>'It's incredibly interesting,' says Dawkins. 'There's just such an amazing juxtaposition of subjects.'</p><p>Donnelly, who's working on a genetics-mapping venture called the HapMap Project, which Anderson claims is 'going to be bigger than the human genome project', looks thoughtful for a moment and then says: 'Inspiring, actually. I mean, it's a little bit pretentious, but the thing is that these are people who are actually capable of changing things.'</p><p>And he's right. Jay Walker, the man who made billions by inventing <a href=\"http://www.Priceline.com\">Priceline.com</a>, a website that lets customers name the price they are willing to pay for everything from airline tickets to cars, bounces on stage to do a three-minute presentation. His next project is to get mobile phones into the hands of 20 million people who earn less than $3 a day. First, he needs to figure out how these people could best use them to improve their lives.</p><p>This would have sounded over-ambitious had a man called Iqbal Quadir not been up on the same stage earlier talking about how his company, GrameenPhone, got phones to 95,000 women in 50,000 Bangladeshi villages and who, as a result, now earn $700 each a year by selling phone services.</p><p>On the last day, Walker, who is one of the richest men in America and has 400 patents to his name goes back on stage to collect ideas from delegates for his phone project. They come in thick and fast: 'Language learning'; 'Talking to old folks'; 'Chatting to sick kids in hospitals'.</p><p>Dawkins opened the conference by telling us that science is 'queerer than we can suppose'. There are some things, he says, that may simply remain beyond our cognitive grasp. I s uspect that TED and its strange and unknowable cross-couplings and effects may be one of those things. The phone scheme may or may not come off. But I certainly wouldn't rule it out.</p><p><strong>According to Ted</strong></p><p>How the scientists see tomorrow's world</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Climate change is going to happen, whether we like it or not. We should start adapting to life in the tropics and use the money currently spent on well-meaning but largely pointless Kyoto endeavours on something else.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> The solution to disease in the developing world could be found in a drinking straw that purifies contaminated water. See <a href=\"http://www.worldchanging.com\">www.worldchanging.com</a>.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Aid doesn't work. At a debate on how the $50 billion for Africa agreed by the G8 nations ought to be spent, the single most applauded idea was that it should be given to the developed world in order to pay off French farmers etc and then abolish the trade tariffs. Ashraf Ghani pointed out that he managed to prise $27.5bn out of the West for Afghanistan but what he needs is to be able to sell his country's products.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Aubrey de Grey hopes to bring an end to ageing. But first, he needs &#163;100 million a year in funding (see <a href=\"http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/index.html\">www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/index.html</a>). However, according to Kari Stefansson of Decode Genetics, this could bring about 'global catastrophe'.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Buy carbon. It could earn you a 30 per cent conscience-free return.

Boycott proposes four-day rather than five-day Tests, with each day containing 105 overs rather than 90 - an argument that was once mooted by Mal colm Speed in the days before he became ICC chief executive.  </p><p>Boycott called the current regulations, which state that play cannot continue for more than half an hour after the scheduled close, \"nothing but a cheats' charter\" because captains were deliberately slowing down the over-rate when their side was in trouble. Fines should be levied in runs rather than dollars and suspensions, he said. Boycott also called for a Twenty20 World Cup and greater use of technology to help umpires.  </p><p>England learned yesterday that they will open their 2007 World Cup campaign in the Caribbean against New Zealand after playing a warm-up game against the holders Australia.

We waited but the first drop didn't fall till December 20. After a day, the rains stopped. Three weeks later, it started to rain again. But then it stopped again after a few days. Since then, we have had no rain.\".   </p><p>The crowd murmurs its assent and one by one, people stand to tell how their own crops wilted and how little they have harvested this year. Anderson says he got five bags of the staple maize crop, Lovewell eight, Jennifer two, Felice three and Jonah seven. Some say they have lost almost everything and will be eating wild foods within weeks. Most say they will be able to hang on only until next month. </p><p>The people of Chikani are experiencing a climatic phenomenon taking place around the world. But the effect of global warming on a village of central African subsistence farmers is different and far more serious than on America or Europe. </p><p>Some northerners bask in the idea that global warming promises delightful summers and longer growing seasons. But rising sea levels and future climatic extremes, causing even a small change in rainfall patterns or temperatures, is perilous now for vast areas of Africa.  </p><p>Where the rich northern city or farmer can adapt, the families of millions of poor Zambian, Congolese or Malawian farmers go hungry for months; urban water supplies are interrupted and wells run dry.  </p><p>Africa is in the frontline of climate change, and for the people of Chikani it makes the difference between food and hunger, migration and stability, sufficiency and destitution - even life and death.  </p><p>Droughts, floods, unseasonal rains, extreme weather and natural disasters have long been common in southern Africa, but new studies are finding a pattern of increasing climatic variability and unpredictability. According to UN agencies and national meteorologists, severe dry and wet periods have become more frequent in the past two to three decades.  </p><p>Old Jonah in Chikani, who has 24 children from three wives and is not known as the \"Tongan bull\" for nothing, doesn't need academics to tell him the climate is changing. \"These are the worst rains ever,\" he says. \"The pattern of rainfall is definitely changing. I remember many bad years but this is the first time the river Musaya has ever dried up. This is the first time that we have only had one place to find water.\"  </p><p>Crop failure this year extends across swathes of southern Zambia, northern Zimbabawe and Malawi. According to the UN's food organisation, 20 countries in Africa are this month facing food emergencies following droughts or \"adverse\" weather. </p><p><strong>Current changes</strong> </p><p>Seven hundred miles to the east of Zambia, in Dar Es Salaam, Stephen Mwakifwamba, national co-ordinator of the Centre for Energy, Environment, Science and Technology - which prepared the Tanzanian government's climate change report to the UN - says that change is happening right now.  </p><p>\"In the past, we had a drought about every 10 years,\" he says. \"Now we just don't know when they will come. They are more frequent, but then so are floods. The climate is far less predictable. We might have floods in May or droughts every three years. Upland areas, which were never affected by mosquitoes, now are. Water levels are decreasing every day. The rains come at the wrong time for farmers and it is leading to many problems.\" </p><p>Tanzania has within its borders one of the most potent symbols of global climate change in Africa: Mount Kilimanjaro has historically been topped with glaciers; now it is almost bare. The signs of warming and growing aridity are found throughout the country's national parks.  </p><p>\"We are finding that the wild animals in Ngorongoro and the Serengeti are getting confused,\" says Mwakifwamba. \"The seasons have changed for them. The warming is affecting their breeding and the hunting season.  </p><p>\"We depend on the environment for everything, so of course we take climate change very seriously. A 1C temperature rise may not sound much to Europeans, who can adapt easily and who can import food and have plenty of water, but here it can be massive and the effects can knock on everywhere. It means low food production, so people head for the cities; it means increasing poverty in rural areas, so there may be more felling of trees to make charcoal, which in turn means more soil loss and desertification.\" </p><p>Few countries in Africa have the resources to prepare major studies of climate change, but those that have agree that Africa is the most vulnerable continent. Seventy per cent of the population rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods, and the slightest shift in rainfall patterns or temperature can be disastrous. Large farms will be able to adapt, but the poor, without access to money or better land, will suffer most.  </p><p><strong>Rising sea levels</strong> </p><p>Tanzania's official report suggests that the areas that usually get two rainfalls in the year will probably get more, and those that get only one rainy season will get far less. The net result is expected to be: 33% less maize - the country's staple crop - will be grown, river flows will fall by 10%, hydropower will be harder to generate, new pests and more plant and human diseases will emerge, and more desertification and soil loss will occur.  </p><p>According to one study by the Worldwatch Institute, advancing seas could inundate heavily populated parts of Gambia, and the Niger Delta in Nigeria. Large cities, such as Alexandria and Lagos, and whole countries such as Gambia, are particularly vulnerable. </p><p>This month, a report on climate change in Africa by British aid agencies said that unless it is urgently addressed, 70 million more Africans will be at risk of hunger. The report predicted that if temperatures rose an expected 2C in Kenya, the crops of 400,000 small tea growers would not grow as well in the heat.  </p><p>In Uganda, areas suitable for growing high-quality coffee would be severely reduced. In Egypt, where 95% of the country's water comes from the Nile, a combination of water shortages upstream, evaporation and increased demand for water for agricultural, domestic and industrial applications is expected to impact heavily. Sea level rises in particular threaten to contaminate groundwater, affecting drinking water and agriculture in coastal zones. </p><p>And if Europeans think Africa's problems will be confined to Africa, the Egyptian government has explained how the potential consequences of climate change could spill their way.  </p><p>\"Increasing temperature increases soil erosion and wind speed, which in turn increases the amount of Saharan dust carried across the Mediterranean to European countries, causing health and economic problems. Increased unemployment &#91;in Africa&#93; increases immigration pressure on Europe. Decrease of water in the Nile increases friction among countries sharing the river, and leads to political unrest.\" </p><p><strong>Historical parallels</strong> </p><p>Scientists at the University of York's environment department recently published research on the likely impact of future climate fluctuations, by modelling the responses of more than 5,000 plant species.  </p><p>The results, says Dr Jon Lovett, who led the research, were extraordinary, with changes - including more intense drought in the Sahel - expected on a similar scale to the climatic disruption in the last ice age and the African forest decline 2,500 years ago. \"The way things are going, it looks like Africa is going to be in for a rough ride over the next few decades,\" he said. </p><p>In the Sahel region, changes are coming thick and fast. A spokesman for Malian development group TNT says: \"Drought is becoming more and more frequent, leading to the drying out of soil and the disappearance of vegetation. The life of an entire population is on hold, waiting for clouds that promise less and less rain.\" </p><p>The impact is exacerbated by human activity. According to many scientists and development groups, the precipitous clearing of the Congo basin forests is altering local climate and rainfall patterns, and increasing the risk of drought. Clearing vegetation increases run-off and soil erosion, and the damming of rivers and draining of wetlands reduces the environment's natural ability to absorb excess water, increasing the impact of floods. </p><p>Back in Chikani, Jonah is sanguine. \"People can always withstand bad harvests and bad rains, but when it happens so often, like now, it is hard. Every year it happens, we become a bit weaker. Every year we become poorer. That is the big problem.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/jun/30/climatechange.climatechangeenvironment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2005/jun/30/climatechange.climatechangeenvironment","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Cameron Duodu: We need to form cartels","webPublicationDate":"2005-06-29T00:21:54Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2005/jun/29/internationalaidanddevelopment.hearafrica05","fields":{"body":"The west is not, out of altruism, going to reverse the system of trade that impoverishes Africa. It is Africa that must fight politically to force the change. Why hasn't it been done before now? The answer is that African governments have, in the past, been short-sighted and self-centred to a degree that borders on stupidity.<P>The west's trade stranglehold is considered by most of us to be murderous and immoral. Our governments may speak to the west in polite, diplomatic terms. But Africans who know the true causes of their continent's poverty consider the west to be part of the problem. They are not interested in palliatives such as aid, and the humiliation of becoming \"highly indebted poor countries\" reliant on charity; they demand economic justice.<P>African countries must band together and form cartels that lay aside money to acquire the means of adding value to their raw materials before export. Goods that are processed can better be held back from sale when prices are low. Opec (and before Opec, the giant oil companies) has proved that economic power comes through cartels. But you cannot form viable cartels using raw cocoa, coffee beans or tea leaves. Unlike oil, which can stay unspoilt underground, food commodities are perishable.<P>However, coffee is the second most important commodity traded in the world - yielding first place only to oil. So if Africa could bite significantly into that market, it could earn enormous sums. Even if Africa could only influence rather than control the prices of its exports, it would not need anyone's assistance to end its poverty.<P>But at present Africa is a \"price taker\", and the value of its exports is determined not by their final price in western sales outlets, but by the initial price offered at the farm gate. So the insulting statement is often made that \"Africa contributes to less than 3% of world trade\". Were account to be taken of the actual volume of raw materials shipped to the west by Africa, plus the huge tonnages with which African products enrich western shipping companies, freight handlers and insurance brokers, it would be realised that the west owes Africa a great deal of money.<P>But African governments are failing to fight their corner. They have been fooled into becoming members of \"alliances\" of coffee and cocoa producers, and of \"international organisations\" ostensibly set up to \"stabilise\" commodity prices. All these bodies have failed in their tasks, but Africa still shrinks from the next step: forming its own cartels to control commodity exports.<P>If Ghana and its neighbour Ivory Coast, say, could pool resources to produce chocolates for export, instead of selling cocoa beans - inviting Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon to join - all could vastly increase their earnings. Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Uganda could similarly band together and place processed coffee in western supermarkets. Ghana and South Africa could cooperate to export gold jewellery, instead of gold bullion. Sierra Leone, Ghana, Botswana and South Africa could buy technology to challenge the diamond polishers of Antwerp, Paris, Tel Aviv and New York.<P>Before Opec flexed its muscles in the 70s, petroleum was selling for under $3 a barrel. Today, it is selling for $58. African governments must take a leaf out of the Opec book. They have already produced an economic programme called the New Economic Partnership for Africa's Development. But Nepad relies heavily on expected inflows of foreign investment, whereas foreign entrepreneurs cannot, by definition, be interested in what Africa really needs - namely, to vertically integrate the continent's industries.<P>Vertically integrated industries are not popular with foreign investors because they can be \"nationalised\". Even if that fear were removed, it is not very sensible, if you are drowning in a river, to expect a crocodile to offer you its tail to ferry you safely ashore.<P>If Africa is able to accumulate enough capital to change its inherited production patterns and earn more from its products, these products will still be faced with punitive tariff walls. But the climate of opinion in the west is shifting against such practices, and it is for African governments to enlist the support of the peoples of the west to force western governments to dismantle such tariffs.<P>It is unrealistic to expect the G8 to act to meet Africa's true needs, despite the pious noises we shall be hearing from Gleneagles.

Wartime propaganda thus achieved an extraordinary afterlife. As Vladimir Putin showed yesterday, the Great Patriotic War remains a key political resource in Russia. In Britain and the US, too, a certain idea of the second world war is enthusiastically kept alive and less flattering memories suppressed.</p><p>Five years ago, Robert Lilly, a distinguished American sociologist, prepared a book based on military archives. Taken by Force is a study of the rapes committed by American soldiers in Europe between 1942 and 1945. He submitted his manuscript in 2001. But after September 11, its US publisher suppressed it, and it first appeared in 2003 in a French translation.</p><p>We know from Anthony Beevor about the sexual violence unleashed by the Red Army, but we prefer not to know about mass rape committed by American and British troops. Lilly suggests a minimum of 10,000 American rapes. Contemporaries described a much wider scale of unpunished sex crime. Time Magazine reported in September 1945: \"Our own army and the British army along with ours have done their share of looting and raping ... we too are considered an army of rapists.\"</p><p>The British and American publics share a sunny view of the second world war. The evil of Auschwitz and Dachau, turned inside out, clothes the conflict in a shiny virtue. Movies, popular histories and political speeches frame the war as a symbol of Anglo-American courage, with the Red Army's central role forgotten. This was, we believe, \"a war for democracy\". Americans believe that they fought the war to rescue the world. For apologists of the British Empire, such as Niall Ferguson, the war was an ethical bath where the sins of centuries of conquest, slavery and exploitation were expiated. We are marked forever as \"the good guys\"and can all happily chant \"Two world wars and one world cup.\"</p><p>All this seems innocent fun, but patriotic myths have sharp edges. The \"good war\" against Hitler has underwritten 60 years of warmaking. It has become an ethical blank cheque for British and US power. We claim the right to bomb, to maim, to imprison without trial on the basis of direct and implicit appeals to the war against fascism.</p><p>When we fall out with such tyrant friends as Noriega, Milosevic or Saddam we rebrand them as \"Hitler\". In the \"good war\" against them, all bad things become forgettable \"collateral damage\". The devastation of civilian targets in Serbia or Iraq, torture at Abu Ghraib and Guant&#225;namo, the war crime of collective punishment in Falluja, fade to oblivion as the \"price of democracy\".</p><p>Our democratic imperialism prefers to forget that fascism had important Anglo-American roots. Hitler's dream was inspired, in part, by the British Empire. In eastern Europe, the Nazis hoped to make their America and Australia, where ethnic cleansing and slave labour created a frontier for settlement. In western Europe, they sought their India from which revenues, labour and soldiers might be extracted.</p><p>American imperialism in Latin America gave explicit precedents for Germany's and Japan's claims of supremacy in their neighbouring regions. The British and Americans were key theorists of eugenics and had made racial segregation respectable. The concentration camp was a British invention, and in Iraq and Afghanistan the British were the first to use air power to repress partisan resistance. The Luftwaffe - in its assault on Guernica, and later London and Coventry - paid homage to Bomber Harris's terror bombing of the Kurds in the 1920s.</p><p>We forget, too, that British and US elites gave aid to the fascists. President Bush's grandfather, prosecuted for \"trading with the enemy\" in 1942, was one of many powerful Anglo-Americans who liked Mussolini and Hitler and did what they could to help. Appeasement as a state policy was only the tip of an iceberg of practical aid to these dictatorships. Capital and technology flowed freely, and fascist despots received dignified treatment in Washington and London. Henry Ford made Hitler birthday gifts of 50,000 marks.</p><p>We least like to remember that our side also committed war crimes in the 1940s. The destruction of Dresden, a city filled with women, children, the elderly and the wounded, and with no military significance, is only the best known of the atrocities committed by our bombers against civilian populations. We know about the notorious Japanese abuse of prisoners of war, but do not remember the torture and murder of captured Japanese. Edgar Jones, an \"embedded\" Pacific war correspondent, wrote in 1946: \"'We shot prisoners in cold blood, wiped out hospitals, strafed lifeboats, killed or mistreated enemy civilians, finished off the enemy wounded, tossed the dying into a hole with the dead, and in the Pacific boiled flesh off enemy skulls to make table ornaments.\"</p><p>After 1945, we borrowed many fascist methods. Nuremberg only punished a handful of the guilty; most walked free with our help. In 1946, Project Paperclip secretly brought more than 1,000 Nazi scientists to the US. Among their ranks were Kurt Blome, who had tested nerve gas at Auschwitz, and Konrad Schaeffer, who forced salt into victims at Dachau. Other experiments at mind control via drugs and surgery were folded into the CIA's Project Bluebird. Japan's Dr Shiro Ishii, who had experimented with prisoners in Manchuria, came to Maryland to advise on bio-weapons. Within a decade of British troops liberating Belsen, they were running their own concentration camps in Kenya to crush the Mau Mau. The Gestapo's torture techniques were borrowed by the French in Algeria, and then disseminated by the Americans to Latin American dictatorships in the 60s and 70s. We see their extension today in the American camps in Cuba and Diego Garcia.</p><p>War has a brutalising momentum. This is the moral of Taken By Force, which shows how American soldiers became increasingly indiscriminate in their sexual violence and military authorities increasingly lax in its prosecution. Even as we remember the evils of nazism, and the courage of those who defeated it, we should begin to remember the second world war with less self- satisfaction. We might, in particular, learn to distrust those who use it to justify contemporary warmongering.</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> <a href=\"mailto:rhdrayton@yahoo.co.uk\">Richard Drayton</a> is senior lecturer in history at Cambridge University.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/may/10/foreignpolicy.usa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2005/may/10/foreignpolicy.usa","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Africa: now for the good news","webPublicationDate":"2005-05-06T12:04:20Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"world/2005/may/06/outlook.development","fields":{"body":"In the waiting area of a large office complex in Accra, Ghana, it is standing room only as citizens with bundles of cash line up to buy shares of a mutual fund that has yielded an average 60% percent annually for the past seven years. They are entrusting their hard-earned cash to a local company, Databank, which invests in stock markets in Ghana, Nigeria, Botswana and Kenya that consistently rank among the world's top growth markets.<p>Chances are you haven't read or heard anything about Databank in the press or on the evening news, where the little coverage of Africa that is offered focuses almost exclusively on the negative &mdash; the spread of HIV/Aids, genocide in Darfur and the chaos of Zimbabwe.<p>Yes, Africa is a land of wars, poverty and corruption, but Africa is also a land of stock markets, internet cafes and a growing middle class. This is the part of Africa that functions. And this Africa also needs media attention if it is to have any chance of fully joining the global economy.<p>Africa's media image comes at a high cost. Stories about hardship and tragedy aim to tug at our heartstrings, getting us to dig into our pockets or urge our leaders to send more aid. But no country or region ever developed thanks to aid alone. Investment, and the job and wealth creation it generates, is the only road to lasting development. That is how China, India and the Asian Tigers did it.<p>Yet while Africa, according to the US government's Overseas Private Investment Corp, offers the highest return in the world on direct foreign investment, it attracts the least. Unless investors see the Africa that is worthy of investment, they won't put their money into it. And that lack of investment translates into job stagnation, continued poverty and limited access to education and health care.<p>Consider a few facts: the Ghana stock exchange regularly tops the list of the world's highest-performing stock markets. Botswana, with its A plus credit rating, boasts one of the highest per capita government savings rates in the world, topped only by Singapore and a handful of other fiscally prudent nations. Cell phones are making phenomenal profits on the continent. Brand-name companies such as Coca-Cola, GM, Caterpillar and Citibank have invested in Africa for years and are quite bullish on the future. The failure to show this side of Africa creates a one-dimensional caricature of a complex continent.<p>I recently produced a documentary on entrepreneurship and private enterprise in Africa. It made me realise how all of us in the media &mdash; even those with a true love of the continent &mdash; portray it in a way that is to its detriment.<p>The first cameraman I called to film the documentary laughed and said: \"Business and Africa, aren't those contradictory terms?\" The second got excited imagining heart-warming images of women's co-ops and market stalls brimming with rustic crafts. Several friends simply assumed I was doing a documentary on Aids. After all, what else does one film in Africa?<p>The little-known fact is that businesses are thriving throughout Africa. With good governance and sound fiscal policies, countries such as Botswana, Ghana, Uganda, Senegal and many more are bustling, their economies growing at robust rates.<p>Private enterprise is not just limited to the well-behaved nations. You can't find a more war-ravaged land than Somalia, which has been without a central government for more than a decade. The big surprise? Private enterprise is flourishing. Mogadishu has the cheapest cell phone rates on the continent, mostly due to no government intervention. In the northern city of Hargeysa the markets sell the latest satellite phone technology. The electricity works. When the state collapsed in 1991 the national airline went out of business. Today there are five private carriers, and price wars keep ticket prices down. This is not the Somalia you see in the media.<p>Obviously life there would be dramatically improved by good governance &mdash; or even just some governance &mdash; but it is also true that, through resilience and resourcefulness, Somalis have been able to create a functioning society.<p>Most African businesses suffer from an extreme lack of infrastructure, but the people I met were too determined to let this stop them. It just costs them more. Without reliable electricity, most businesses have to use generators. They have to dig bore-holes for a dependable water source. Telephone lines are notoriously out of service, but cell phones are filling the gap.<p>Throughout Africa what I found was a private sector working hard to find African solutions to African problems. One example that will always stick in my mind is the CEO of Vodacom Congo, the largest cell phone company in that country. Alieu Conteh started his business while the civil war was still raging. With rebel troops closing in on the airport in Kinshasa, no foreign manufacturer would send in a cell phone tower, so Conteh got locals to collect scrap metal, which they welded together to build one. That tower stands today.<p>As I interviewed successful entrepreneurs, I was continually astounded by their ingenuity, creativity and steadfastness. These people are the future of the continent. They are the ones we should be talking to about how to move Africa forward. Instead the media concentrates on victims or government officials, and as anyone who has worked in Africa knows, government is more often a part of the problem than of the solution.<p>When the foreign media descend on the latest crisis the person they look to interview is invariably the foreign saviour, an aid worker from the US or Europe. African saviours are everywhere, delivering aid on the ground. But they don't seem to be in our cultural belief system. It's not just the media, either. Look at the literature put out by almost any non-governmental organisation. The better ones show images of smiling African children &mdash; smiling because they have been helped by the NGO. The worst promote the distended-belly, flies-on-the-face clich&eacute; of Africa, hoping that the pain of seeing those images will fill their coffers. \"We hawk poverty,\" one NGO worker admitted to me.<p>Most of the time Africa is simply not on the map. The continent's booming stock markets are almost never mentioned in newspaper financial pages. How often is an African country &mdash; apart, perhaps, from South Africa or Egypt or Morocco &mdash; featured in a travel section? Even the listing of worldwide weather includes only a few African cities.<p>There are lots of reasons for the media's neglect of Africa: bean counters in the newsroom and the high cost of international coverage, the belief that US viewers aren't interested in international stories, and the infotainment of news. There is also journalists' reluctance to pursue \"positive stories\". Such stories don't win awards or make it to the front-page, but what is happening in Africa doesn't need to be cast in any special light. The Ghana stock exchange was the fastest-growing exchange in the world in 2003. That is not a \"positive\" story, that is news. I imagine that a lot of consumers would have found it newsworthy to learn where they could have made a 144% return on their money.<p>My independent film was made possible by funding from the World Bank, for which I am extremely grateful. But the bank would not have had to step in if the media had been doing their job &mdash; showing all Africans in all facets of their lives. In a business that is supposed to cover man-bites-dog stories, the idea that Africa doesn't work is a dog-bites-man story. If the media are really looking for news, they would look at the ways that Africa, despite all the odds, does work.<p>Carol Pineau, a journalist, is<p>the producer and director of<p>Africa: Open for Business"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/06/outlook.development","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2005/may/06/outlook.development","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Voluntary sector briefing: April 29 2005","webPublicationDate":"2005-04-29T10:40:21Z","sectionId":"society","id":"society/2005/apr/29/1","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>&#183;</strong> Find out about the new charity TV series<br /><strong>&#183;</strong> Read about the benefits of Corporate Social Responsibility<br /><strong>&#183;</strong> Job of the week - earn up to £60,000 helping developing nations reduce poverty through access to technology</p><p>Welcome to SocietyGuardian.co.uk's weekly round up for voluntary sector professionals</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^<br /><strong>WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR THIS WEEK</strong></p><p>Economic liberalism is hitting the world's poor, Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said during a service to mark the 60th anniversary of the charity Christian Aid.

Aquinas is one of 120 schools benefiting from the donation of computers and training from Computers For Schools Kenya (CFSK), a Nairobi-based charity helping to produce a new generation of computer-savvy young Kenyans.</p><p>This month, Aquinas became one of five pilot schools that have gone online thanks to a wireless internet connection. \"School children who don't have IT knowledge are at a disadvantage,\" believes head teacher George Muthee. \"Many of our pupils come from severely disadvantaged backgrounds, but by being able to offer IT classes, students stand a much better chance of getting a job or going to college.\"</p><p>Despite having no mains electricity at home, student Peter Chada is aware of the importance of an IT education. \"Everything is becoming computerised and if you're going for a professional or office job the first thing an employer asks you is whether you are computer literate,\" says the 18-year-old, who aims to become a computer engineer.</p><p>A skilled and computer literate workforce is now widely recognised as being a key factor in Africa's ability to boost its productivity and attract investment.</p><p>\"Information communication technology has been identified by the UN as a driving force for development,\" says Tom Musili, executive director of CFSK, which launched in 2002 and now has a staff of more than 30.</p><p>\"The Kenyan government, industry and civil society all recognise that for Kenya to remain competitive in today's knowledge-based economy, more must be done and done urgently to increase access to ICT skills training.\"</p><p>However, with a vast number of Kenyans unable to afford to finish secondary school education, access to school computers and ICT skills is still restricted to the lucky few.</p><p>\"Most Kenyan schools lack even the most basic ICT resources because of the cost. The result is that the vast majority of Kenyan schoolchildren leave school without having seen a computer,\" says Musili.</p><p>Certainly George Muthee recognises how lucky his school has been in receiving 20 PCs and the ICT training that he and ICT teacher Charles Nganga got from CFSK.</p><p>\"When I first heard of them, I ran very fast to ensure Aquinas was at the front of the queue,\" says a beaming Muthee. \"It was a golden opportunity for us. We would never have been able to buy 20 PCs.\"</p><p>CFSK has embarked upon an ambitious programme of rolling out PCs to Kenya's schools. \"Our vision is quite simple,\" says Musili. \"By 2009, we aim to place almost 15,000 PCs in nearly 600 schools, provide the necessary training and support, as well as boost internet usage and access.\"</p><p>Crucial to this vision are the supporters from within Kenya and overseas who help fund the program.</p><p>One of its most important partners is UK-based Computer Aid International (CAI), which supplies CFSK with most of its computers.</p><p>An estimated 3m PCs are decommissioned every year in the UK by thousands of companies who upgrade and change IT systems. However, many are in good working order. Since 1998, CAI has placed 45,000 computers in the developing world.</p><p>\"End-of-life PCs are worthless to most companies but invaluable to schoolchildren,\" says Tony Roberts, director of CAI. \"Companies see getting rid of old kit as one big headache. We can take care of their headaches while ensuring the PCs go to good causes.\"</p><p>Roberts rejects criticism that with so much poverty in Africa, priority should be given to basic educational resources such as books and desks.</p><p>\"Computers are no longer an optional extra. Without appropriate vocational training and skills development, young people will remain locked into a cycle of poverty and marginalisation,\" he says.</p><p>\"Governments in Africa are not trying to decide if they should invest in ICTs, they're focused on determining how much they can invest and how soon. It's a matter of great urgency.</p><p>\"Unless developing economies such as Kenya are enabled to break out of the cycle of poverty they will always remain dependent upon aid,\" argues Roberts.</p><p>\"This endless cycle will only be broken by rich countries providing aid that will impact directly and positively on people's livelihoods by developing marketable skills and increased options for better jobs.\"</p><p>Back at Aquinas, Charles Nganga winds up another double period of ICT. \"While many of our pupils come from poor and disadvantaged families, we work hard at instilling in the boys the idea that they can achieve anything if they work hard at school,\" says Nganga. \"The continuing success of CFSK is a crucial part of this process.\" <br /></p><p><strong>Links</strong></p><p><strong>Computers For Schools Kenya </strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.cfsk.org\">www.cfsk.org</a></p><p><strong>Computer Aid International</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.computer-aid.org\">www.computer-aid.org</a></p><p>&middot; If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Online, send your emails to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@guardian.co.uk\">online.feedback@guardian.co.uk</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2005/apr/07/kenya.environment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2005/apr/07/kenya.environment","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"This week's Online supplement","webPublicationDate":"2005-04-07T11:15:08Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/blog/2005/apr/07/thisweeksonli6","fields":{"body":"<p><img style=\"float: right; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px;\" border=\"0\" height=\"128\" width=\"128\" src=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2005/04/06/map_emmadodd.jpg\"/>As another Thursday morning rolls around and I once more overdose on coffee, it's time for the obligatory run-down of what's in this week's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/weekly/\">Online supplement</a>.</p><p>We start with an article on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1453293,00.html\">new trend for citizen mapping</a> - people using technology to make maps on their own.

Christians celebrate a pagan fertility cult, while non-believers make their biannual journey to church. People whose lives are dominated by godless consumption give something up for Lent. A society governed by science engages in the ritual sacrifice and homeopathic magic - eggs and chicks and rabbits - required to induce the earth to bear fruit. <P>Why? Well, having read this you might fairly accuse me of drawing wide inferences from limited data, but the work of a soil geologist at the University of Oregon offers such a fascinating possible explanation of some of these contradictions that I cannot resist indulging in speculation.  <P>Professor Greg Retallack has spent much of the past few years taking soil samples from the sites of the temples of ancient Greece. He has stumbled on a remarkable phenomenon. There is a strong link, challenged by only a few exceptions, between the identity of the god worshipped at a particular temple and the temple's location. Where Artemis or Apollo were celebrated, the soil was of a kind called a lithic xerept, where montane scrub suitable only for nomadic herders grows. Nomads living on soils called xeralfs, by contrast, worshipped Hera and Hermes. Subsistence farmers cultivating soils called rendolls built temples to Demeter and Dionysus, while fluvent soils capable of supporting large farms lie beneath shrines to Hestia, Hephaestus and Ares. The gods of ancient Greece, Professor Retallack suggests, \"came not from an imaginary poetic city on Mt Olympus, but personify ancient local lifestyles\". The ancients were worshipping their own means of subsistence.  <P>The Abrahamic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam - were constructed by recently settled nomads. These are people who were likely to have been making use of soils such as lithic xerepts and xeralfs. Nomads, being without permanent homes, characteristically have no local deities: most of them worship a single God of the heavens. The Turkana of northern Kenya use the same word - Akuj - to mean both sky and God. The Mongols, Turks and Tartars all worshipped Tengri, God of the Blue Sky.  <P>In the first books of the Bible, the nomads are God's children, the city people his outcasts. The first city the Bible mentions was built by Cain, a tiller of the ground (and therefore an inhabitant of more fertile soils), who was cursed by God after murdering his nomad brother.   The defining ecological image of the Pentateuch is that of the nomad Abraham, gazing down upon the plains, where the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are burning.  <P>Thereafter, God's relationship to the city becomes more equivocal. In Kings I we discover that the ark of the covenant is housed in \"the city of David, which is Zion\". By Nehemiah's time, Jerusalem has become \"the holy city\". But to Ezekiel it is a place of \"lewdness\" and \"whoredoms\". \"Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great ... that the scum of it may be consumed.\" This tension survives into the New Testament. In the sermon on the mount, Jesus speaks of his flock as a city on a hill. But even then the wilderness - the uncultivated pasture of the nomads - remained the realm of terrestrial purity, the haunt of John the Baptist and the retreat of Christ.  <P>What happened between the time of Abraham and the time of Christ was that the nomads, having seized the fertile soils where the farmers dwelt, settled down. While they still looked back with longing upon the lives of their ancestors, their theology shifted to match their circumstances.  <P>With this shift came something new: a belief in progress. The philosopher John Gray has pointed out that, while pagans typically see history as a cyclical process, Judaism, Christianity and Islam all claim to be working towards a denouement: \"salvation is the culmination of history\". The followers of these religions see life not as an endless cycle of hubris and nemesis, but as a journey towards a moment of transformation.  <P> If you are constantly subject to the whims of the environment, as hunters and gatherers, nomads and primitive farmers are, an awareness of the cyclical nature of history is forced upon you. Your fortunes change with the seasons, the patterns of rainfall, the happenstances of ecology. Glut is followed by famine, followed by glut, followed by famine. Nomas, the Greek word from which nomad comes, means \"the search for pasture\". The name recognises the fragility of the people's existence.  <P>A belief in progress, by contrast, is surely possible only after you have developed secure means of storing crops for long periods, and a diversified - and therefore more robust - economy. It is possible, in other words, only if you live on rendoll or fluvent soils, and build cities there.  <P>The myth of the Fall is the story of hunters and gatherers exceeding their ecological limits. They were forced out of Eden and into cultivation (Cain) and nomadism (Abel). But having conquered the fertile lands and developed an advanced agricultural economy, the former nomads who worshipped a single God were able, as technology improved, gradually to release themselves from some of the constraints of nature.  <P>It is surely this release which permitted them to believe that the cycle of   history need no longer apply: that the human story could instead be cumulative and progressive. From there it is a short step to the belief that history is moving towards a fixed point, when humans enjoy total victory over the material world, as the dead rise and live forever. If the myth of the Fall is the story of our subjection to biological realities, the myth of eternal life is the story of our escape from them. The first myth invokes the second. The gun on the wall in act one must be used in act three.  <P>Is it difficult to see why this doctrine should be attractive to people still subject to the gruelling realities of nature? The Christian God would cure disease and even death, calm storms, summon food out of thin air. With a handful of literate evangelists, the fantasy of material abandonment was able to conquer the world.  <P>My untested hypothesis is as follows. The peculiarities of the Abrahamic religions - their astonishing success in colonising the world and their dangerous notion of progress (inherited by secular society) - result from a marriage between the universal God of the nomads and the conditions which permitted cities to develop. The dominant beliefs of the past 2,000 years are the result of an ancient migration from soils such as xerepts and xeralfs to soils such as fluvents and rendolls.  <P>At Easter, the Christian belief in a permanent resurrection is mixed up with the pagan belief in a perpetual cycle of temporary resurrection and death. In church we worship the Christian notion of progress, which has filtered into every aspect of our lives. But, amid the cracking of Easter eggs and the murmur of prayer, there can still be heard the small, faint voice which reminds us that our ecological hubris must eventually be greeted by nemesis.  <P> <A HREF=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</A>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/22/religion.uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2005/mar/22/religion.uk","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Science aid","webPublicationDate":"2005-02-08T01:13:40Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2005/feb/08/science.highereducation","fields":{"body":"<p>In the first week of January, the phone rang at the Southampton Oceanography Centre. It was the ministry of defence with a highly unusual request. When the large earthquake shook the Indian Ocean floor on Boxing Day, the Royal Navy vessel HMS Scott had been stationed nearby. Its highly specialised deep-sea surveying technology was useless near the tsunami-ravaged coastlines. But it was ideally placed to map the quake zone.</p><p>\"They said: 'We've got the kit, we've got a window of opportunity where we could go and use it, but we want some specific scientific advice on exactly the best place to go',\" says Dr Justin Dix, a geophysicist at the Southampton centre. \"It was an opportunity not to be missed.\"</p><p>A few weeks later, two of Dix's colleagues, Dr Lisa McNeill and Dr Tim Henstock, had boarded a plane bound for the Indian Ocean. \"For us, it was very quick,\" Dix says. \"Using normal grant channels, it would have taken ages to get to the location.\" Now, the rupture zone would be untouched by erosion. \"The last time a great marine earthquake occurred, it was 30 years until the technology was developed to actually survey it.\"</p><p>The survey data collected by the Scott will be the basis of years, if not decades, of geological study. \"They are not going to come off the boat with information that says 'the next earthquake will be at this point, at this time',\" says Dix. \"But if anybody is ever going to resolve the issue of predicting when earthquakes happen, or what their impact could be if they do happen, then this is an essential part of that long road.\"</p><p>The tsunamis in Asia have sparked a hive of activity in scientific circles. On February 1 a meeting was held in Bangkok to coordinate the international scientific response. Co-facilitated by the British Geological Survey (BGS), the meeting brought together scientists of many disciplines to discuss possible warning systems and assistance to recovery efforts.</p><p>\"We now have an agreed list of priorities set by the governments of the affected countries,\" says Dr David Ovadia, director of the international branch of BGS, who attended the conference. In Sri Lanka, the top priority is help with clean groundwater, he says, whereas Thailand wants to know the effect of the tsunami on different types of beaches. \"Now we can start putting together our response.\"</p><p>The surge in interest in how science can aid suffering goes beyond the tsunami. Gordon Brown, the chancellor, promised more funds for international aid this year. This has left scientists warning that the money should not only be spent on direct relief, but also on building scientific capability in developing countries.</p><p>In mid-January, the Royal Society said that Britain should urge rich countries to earmark funding for this during its \"double presidency\" of the G8 countries and the European Union this year. \"It is essential that there is also investment in the long-term development of the scientific capacity of these countries,\" said Professor Julia Higgins, the society's foreign secretary.</p><p>Her calls were prompted by a UN report, published last month, urging the international community to recognise the importance of science and technology to development.</p><p>In the UK last year, the House of Commons science and technology committee derided the Department for International Development (DfID) for the way it handled science. Its research expenditure was neither coordinated with other funders nor spent where it could make the most difference to poverty, the committee said. Its report echoed highly critical voices from within the science community itself.</p><p>\"At the moment &#91;DfID is&#93; rebuilding on the Mozambique flood plain, in an area which was devastated, without asking whether it is going to flood again, and the answer is yes, it is,\" Professor John Lawton, a distinguished environmental scientist and chief executive of the Natural Environment Research Council, told the committee last March. \"It is a huge waste of taxpayers' money. The fact that they are not getting the advice, not even asking for it in the most elementary and strategic way, I think is scandalous.\"</p><p>Since then, things have changed at DfID. It has restructured its research department, promised to hire more scientists and been given a bigger research budget. In this summer's spending review, DfID's annual science budget was set to rise from &#163;80m to &#163;100m in 2008.</p><p>Robert Key, shadow science minister and member of the committee, said he was impressed by DfID's response. \"Hilary Benn &#91;the secretary of state for international development&#93; gave the quickest and most positive response to a select committee report I have ever known,\" he says. \"It became very clear that the impact of our report was causing fundamental changes in the way the department worked.\"</p><p>The government published its formal response to the report last month, announcing that it would set up a working group to look into the need for a new, grant-giving Development Science Research Board. Sir David King, the government's chief scientific adviser, will chair the group and its recommendations will feed into the next science budget discussions in 2006.</p><p>However, as development science stretches across so many different disciplines, King's group will aim to avoid duplication of administrative mechanisms. This could mean that a research board might advise on, but not administrate, grants.</p><p>\"There's obviously an issue of how many boards there are,\" says Paul Spray, head of research at DfID. \"The OST and the research councils agree that a proliferation of boards doesn't help. The idea of a grant-giving board is up for question. But the government is not dismissing it.\"</p><p>At a meeting in London last week on science and technology capacity-building in Africa, Benn outlined DfID's renewed focus on research. \"If we can bring passion, money, commitment and practical help to those affected by the tsunami, then why can't we bring the same passion, money, commitment and practical help to fighting the 'silent tsunamis' of poverty, want, ignorance, disease?\" he asked. Malaria, he said, kills as many people as died in the tsunami every seven weeks in Africa.</p><p>At the meeting last week, DfID announced a new &#163;1m-a-year grant for research on tobacco control in partnership with Canadian funders. A similar scheme will be announced this year for building health research capacity in Malawi and Kenya.</p><p>However, a clear message coming out of the meeting was that Africans, not the developed nations, should set the agenda. \"The really nice thing &#91;at the meeting&#93; was that there were a lot of African scientists speaking. Not a bunch of UK researchers telling them what to do,\" Spray says.</p><p>He expects Tony Blair's Commission for Africa to mention the importance of science capacity-building when it reports later this spring. \"I would be quite surprised if that does not come out of it. We can't pour money into British research institutes only.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/feb/08/science.highereducation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2005/feb/08/science.highereducation","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Full text: Gordon Brown's speech","webPublicationDate":"2005-01-26T15:13:18Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2005/jan/26/development.uk","fields":{"body":"Let me first of all thank you for giving me the chance to speak to this gathering of men and women concerned about international development in advance   of the first G7 Finance Ministers meeting of 2005. And as we prepare at the same   time for the report of the Commission for Africa which will inform our   discussions at G7 and G8, let me also thank UNDP and Mark Malloch Brown in   particular for their leadership on development - and I welcome the recent   challenging Sachs Report setting out practical proposals to achieve the   Millennium Development Goals.   <P>Tomorrow we recall the 60th anniversary of the terrible events of the Holocaust. Let us remember how out of the chaos and tragedies of the 1940s was born the   United Nations to embody our aspirations and hopes for a better world.   And let me also thank all churches, faith groups, non-governmental   organisations, all those concerned with development represented here, for your   visionary, often pioneering, work. <P>In his book The Power of Myth, Joseph   Campbell described a hero as someone who have given their life to something   bigger than themselves. So I want to honour you and members of your   organisations as our modern heroes: fighting for great causes, standing for the   highest ideals, often working in difficult conditions and bearing huge burdens   and bringing the greatest of hope to those in the greatest of needs. And I   congratulate you for coming together in the unique global coalition - Making   Poverty History.   <P>I believe that this year - already a testing time for the international   community - is a year of great challenge but also a year of great opportunity   and - potentially - a year of destiny: for I believe that in this year we, the   international community, can agree a plan for a new deal between developed and   developing countries as bold and as generous as the Marshall Plan of the 1940s.   And my purpose in speaking to you this morning is to set out detailed   proposals in advance of the G7 finance ministers, the first of four G7 finance   ministers meetings this year, the first to prepare for the G8 summit to be   chaired by Tony Blair at Gleneagles this summer, the first when funding for work   on HIV/Aids, malaria and building-trade capacity will join debt relief and   funding for development on the agenda of a G7 Finance Ministers summit.     2005 is important not simply because British chairmanship of the G7 and G8   will lead us forward to the vitally important September UN millennium summit   where we must discuss the progress, or lack of progress, in meeting the   millennium development goals.  <P>2005 is also the 20th anniversary of Live Aid, for millions of people the   first time they were confronted by the reality of famine and death in Africa.   And I believe that already this year the response to the tsunami - the modern   world's greatest natural disaster - has demonstrated to us all the willingness   of the British people and other peoples to come to the aid of fellow human   beings who suffer.   <P>Indeed, far from there being compassion fatigue, perhaps for the first time   millions more people are understanding just how closely and irrevocably bound   together are the fortunes of the richest persons in the richest country to the   fate of the poorest persons in the poorest country of the world. Events which   bind the world together are drawing them to the conclusion that even strangers   who may never meet and may never know each other at first hand are neighbours   brought together by shared needs, mutual interests, common purposes and our   linked destinies, As Martin Luther King put it, increasingly we can see   ourselves as each strands in an inescapable network of mutuality, together woven   into a single garment of destiny.   <P>But it is not just enlightened self-interest that is encouraging people to be   concerned about the needs of the needy and the suffering of the sick, but a   moral sense that we all share that leads us to conclude that when some are poor   all are impoverished, when some are deprived our whole society is diminished,   when some are hurt the whole society shares that suffering. That we are part of   one moral universe and wherever and whenever there is poverty, deprivation and   need it is our duty to act.  <P>And I am convinced that millions of people in Britain and in every continent   who have given more generously than ever before in the aftermath of the tsunami   now yearn for that unprecedented demonstration of generosity to be given   enduring purpose - as Make Poverty History argues - with a new deal for all   developing countries that will address the underlying causes of their poverty,   their illiteracy and their disease.   <P>So in pursuit of this, Tony Blair, who set up and chairs the Commission for   Africa, will give a major speech at Davos on these very issues and our   international development secretary Hilary Benn - who has played such a big part   working with NGOs, organising emergency aid and visiting south-east Asia in the   response to the tsunami - has this morning announced a major new initiative on   education funding. Indeed because the first millennium development target -   gender equality for boys and girls in education - due to be met in 2005 - is not   likely to be met, the United Kingdom will provide by 2008 over £1.4bn for   education with a particular focus on the education of girls. And our aim is that   the 105 million children, 60 million girls, who do not go to school today will   be able to go to school.   <P>No statistics however depressing can prepare you for the hopelessness and   human loss that lies behind the numbers but I saw too amidst terrible suffering   hope, optimism and a determination especially among mothers to see things   change.   <P>From the suffering in Africa I witnessed and the potential in Africa I could   glimpse it is our duty to act and to act urgently.   In Tanzania I saw eight-, nine-, 10-, 11-year-old children begging to continue in school   - but denied the chance because their parents could not pay the fees.   In Mozambique young mothers desperate for their children to go to school   waving their pay cheques of £5 a week - and raising their hands as one to   complain angrily that they cannot even begin to afford the fees.  <P> In Kenya children chanting free education - but secondary education is forever   beyond their grasp.   Yet surely it is our belief that every child is precious. Every child is unique.   Every child is very special.   Every child deserves our support.   No child should be left out.   Every child matters.   Every child counts.   You cannot blame a child for her poverty.   You cannot hold a child responsible for her deprivation.   You cannot condemn a child for no fault of her own.   You cannot consider a child, however sick, as of no consequence... and dismiss   her as unproductive or uneconomic.   But that is what we allow to happen.   <P>But our great obligation as adults is to the child, especially the most   vulnerable.   And in turn children have a right to expect adults to take care of them.   It is because every child counts that the potential of every child should be   the foundation of our policies internationally and nationally.   <P>And just like the draft report of the Commission for Africa - and we look   forward to the Commission's final report - our agenda for the G7 is founded on   the realisation that despite the promise of every world leader, every   government, every international authority that by 2015 we would achieve primary   education for all, a two-thirds fall in infant mortality and a halving of global   poverty, at best on present progress in sub Saharan Africa:   <P><B>&#183;</B> primary education for all will be delivered not as the millennium   development goals solemnly promised in 2015 but 2130 - that is 115 years   late;     <B>&#183;</B> the halving of poverty not as the richest countries promised by 2015 but   by 2150 - that is 135 years late;       <B>&#183;</B> and the elimination of avoidable infant deaths not as we the richest nations   promised by 2015 but by 2165 - that is 150 years late.   <P>Africans know that it is often necessary to be patient but the whole world   should now know that 150 years is too long to ask peoples to wait for justice.   And I say to this audience: justice promised will forever be justice denied   until we remove from this generation the burden of debts incurred by past   generations.  <P>Justice promised will forever be justice denied unless we remove trade   barriers that undermined economic empowerment.   Justice promised will forever be justice denied unless there is a plan for   Africa and all poorest countries as bold as the Marshall Plan of the 1940s,   releasing the resources we need to match reform with finance to tackle   illiteracy, disease and poverty.   <P>So the first essential element of a 2005 development plan for a new deal is that we take the final historic step in delivering full debt relief for the debt-burdened countries with a new agreement on multilateral debt relief that will   enable billions to be reallocated to education and health in the poorest   countries.   <P>I have seen what has been achieved because of debt relief so far.   Because of debt relief in Tanzania, 31,000 new classrooms have been built,   18,000 new teachers recruited and the goal of primary education for all will be   achieved by the end of 2005.   Because of debt relief in Mozambique half a million children are now being   vaccinated against tetanus, whooping cough and diphtheria.   <P>But when many developing countries are still choosing between servicing their   debts and making the investments in health, education and infrastructure that   would allow them to achieve the millennium development goals, we know we must do   more.   <P>Up to 80% of the historic debt of some of the poorest countries is now   owed to international institutions and I have set out detailed proposals to use   IMF gold to write off debt owed to the IMF; to ask World Bank shareholders to   take over the debts owed by up to 70 of the poorest countries to them; and   having signed long term agreements already with Tanzania, Mozambique and then   with other countries, we - Britain - have announced that from now until 2015 we   will take responsibility for our share - 10% - of the World Bank debt, making this offer not just to the 37 heavily indebted poor countries but to   all low-income countries, as long as they can ensure debt relief is used for   poverty reduction.   <P>We make this offer unilaterally but we are now asking other countries to join   us contributing in this way or to a World Bank trust fund.   And I also ask the European Union which deserves credit for more than 1.5bn euros of debt relief so far to match that generosity with deeper   multilateral debt relief.   <P>Alongside more debt relief, 2005 is the opportunity that may not easily return   if missed, to agree a progressive approach to trade.   We all know the damage that rich countries protectionism has done to the   poorest and our proposals mean Europe and the richest countries must agree to   open our markets, remove trade-distorting subsidies and in particular, do more   to urgently tackle the scandal and waste of the Common Agricultural Policy. We   must also amend the rules of origin requirements - requirements which instead of   promoting fair trade have become a barrier to fair trade - and agree new simple rules of origin coordinated across continents. <P>And I call on the EU in its work   on economic partnership agreements to take a non-mercantilist approach and put   development first so that poor countries are able to sequence their trade reform   within their poverty reduction strategies and participate on equal terms in the   international economy. <P>But - as I have heard from every African president, prime minister, finance minister and trade minister I have met - though trade justice matters so too does making sure developing countries have the additional resources they need to take advantage of trading and investment opportunities - and to prevent their most vulnerable people from falling further into poverty as they become integrated into the global economy. <P>It is not enough to say, 'You're on your own, simply compete.' We have to say, 'We will help you build the capacity you need to trade.' Not just opening the door but helping you gain the strength to cross the threshold. <P>Infrastructure is key. Even today for 12 African countries, less than 10% of their roads are   paved. Telecommunication costs are such that calls from the poorest countries to the USA are five times the costs of calls from a developed country. While water and sanitation underpin health and development, even today 40bn working hours in Africa each year are used up to collect water.   And while tariff costs are often highlighted, it is actually transport costs that often constitute a bigger burden of the cost of exporting. With freight and insurance costs representing 15% of the total value of African exports it is difficult for them to be competitive. <P>So we must also provide developing countries with the additional resources they need to build physical infrastructure - road, rail, electricity, telecommunications - institutional capacity - from legal and financial systems to basic property rights - and, of course, investment in human capital to enable growth, investment, trade and therefore poverty reduction. We support the proposals put forward by the Africa Commission on infrastructure: <P><B>&#183;</B> a fund to support infrastructure priorities;     <B>&#183;</B> loan finance for small and medium-sized businesses and for micro-credit;     <B>&#183;</B> a science and technology and tertiary education plan;     <B>&#183;</B> and a plan for rural development, irrigation, research, encouragement of local markets, land reform and environmental improvement. <P>And at its very core this economic development plan demands that all of us, rich and poor countries alike, be fully transparent in our dealings, unapologetically address corruption, be truly accountable, show where the money goes. And the way to achieve this is for all of us to put transparency and the   best governance into practice by all of us, rich countries and poor together, opening our books - with, in particular, a new honesty amongst the richest countries about the levels of developed country protectionism and of tied aid. <P>So I repeat: we will open our books, all countries must also open their books. But to progress what voices all over Africa demand on debt and trade cannot happen unless there we take a third step - a substantial increase in resources for development, to tackle illiteracy, disease and deprivation. <P>Making better use of existing aid - reordering priorities, untying aid and pooling funds internationally to release additional funds for the poorest countries - is essential to achieve both value for money and the improved outcomes we seek. But we must recognise that while 10 years ago aid to Africa was  $33 per person, today it has not risen but fallen to just  $27 so we are a long way short of the predictable, regular financing necessary to make the difference that is needed. <P>While the Marshall Plan transferred 1% of richest country's national income to the poorest, our proposal is for each of the richest countries to reach 0.7% of national income in long-term and predictable aid for investment. I congratulate Par Nuder and the Swedish government for their leadership - having already reached 0.7 - and I urge all countries to join us in becoming countries which have either already reached 0.7 or have set a timetable towards it. <P>We are of course prepared to consider all proposals for raising international finance including international taxes and are happy to do so in detail. But I believe that even as we do so we should also agree to create now, this year, on the road to 0.7%, an International Finance Facility (IFF) that each year from 2005 to 2015 generates  $50 billion a year more of resources - the quickest, most effective way of guaranteeing long-term, stable, predictable funding. <P>The IFF is founded upon long-term, binding donor commitments from the richest countries like ourselves. It builds upon the additional  $16 billion already pledged at Monterrey. And on the basis of these commitments and more it leverages in additional money from the international capital markets to raise the amount of development aid for the years to 2015. <P>I welcome President Chirac's proposals today to raise additional international finance and his initiative on international taxation to back and complement the IFF. And I thank him for his support for immediate implementation of the IFF. With one bold stroke: doubling development aid to halve poverty. $50 billion more in aid a year each year for the poorest countries. <P>Our fourth objective made possible by the International Finance Facility is to provide the $6 billion more a year needed to fund primary education free of charge - ensuring the $105 million children today and every day denied schooling can learn with classrooms, teachers and books. And with the IFF we can ensure all developing countries have the increased, predictable, up front funding they need to abolish user fees and enable more effective teacher recruitment and training, greater provision of teaching and learning materials, improvements to school buildings and sanitation facilities, and special help to get girls into education. <P>Our fifth objective for which there is a detailed implementation plan drawn up by and coordinated by the Department of International Development is that the IFF provide the proper funds that would allow us to build health care systems, match the medical breakthroughs now being achieved in developing a preventive vaccine for malaria by the farsightedness of an advance purchase scheme that could prevent the loss of more than $1 million lives a year because of this dread disease, and tackle HIV/Aids with the first comprehensive plan from prevention to cure and care. <P>Aids is not a curse that we must deny said Nelson Mandela - it is a disease that can be defeated and the way forward on HIV/Aids cannot involve one initiative in isolation but requires a comprehensive strategy: <P><B>&#183;</B> a global advance purchasing scheme to ensure that vaccines go into commercial production and are available at affordable prices;     <B>&#183;</B> prevention, treatment, and care for all those who need it including increased and more predictable funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria;     <B>&#183;</B> the development of essential healthcare systems with well-trained staff and equipment, and the abolition of health user fees for basic health services;     <B>&#183;</B> a global anti-poverty strategy - in particular funding the development of education and sanitation systems which can reduce the chance of infection and help sick people stay healthy longer. <P>And because only £400 million a year is spent on research for a preventive HIV/Aids vaccine and because the challenge is to internationalise HIV/Aids research, coordinating it worldwide, sharing information globally, more widely and more rapidly, with resources directed to the top scientific priorities, the G7 will - for the first time - discuss a joint UK-Italian paper on financing a worldwide infrastructure for sharing and coordinating research in AIDS and then for encouraging the development of viable drugs, vaccines and other technologies such as microbiocides. <P>And let me give you a glimpse into what is possible by applying the principles of the International Finance Facility to the work of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI). Over the last five years GAVI have immunised 50 million children round the world - the most successful global immunisation programme in history. <P>So Hilary Benn and I welcome the announcement made yesterday by both the Gates Foundation and the Norwegian Government for an additional  $1 billion for GAVI to spend on immunisation over the next 10 years. GAVI have, together with the UK, France and the Gates Foundation, developed a proposal to apply the principles of the IFF to the immunisation sector - with donors making long-term commitments that can be leveraged up via the international capital markets in order to frontload the funding available to tackle disease. <P>On behalf of the United Kingdom, the International Development Minister Hilary Benn will announce today that we propose to make a substantial contribution for 15 years to this new financing facility for immunisation of  $1.8bn. We are urging other donors to also contribute. And if, by these means, GAVI could increase the funding for its immunisation programme by an additional  $4bn over the next ten years, it would be possible to save the lives of an additional five million people between now and 2015 and a further five million lives after 2015. <P>If this is what we can achieve by applying the principles of the IFF with one fund and one initiative think what we can achieve not just in health but in education and economic development. So the aim of the International Finance Facility is to bridge the gap between promises and reality.   Between hopes raised and hopes dashed. Between an opportunity seized and an opportunity squandered. <P>It is about action to right wrongs this year, now, urgently. No longer evading, no longer procrastinating, no more excuses, not an idea that will take years to implement but one which can move forward immediately. I welcome the support given to the IFF by almost 50 countries. And in the forthcoming G7/8 discussions we will ask all countries to join those who have already given their backing to support and sign up to the IFF-- and we will be setting out a framework within which we can implement it. <P>It is because I believe the need for action is urgent that we must act now. I saw in Africa - more clearly than anything else: a healthcare system in crisis; and education in crisis too; and the terrible human cost of these failures. <P>We take it for granted that education and health are universal and free. But the people of Africa are doubly disadvantaged for instead of a free education and free health service African countries increasingly charge for secondary schooling and charge even for the most basic of medical drugs and fees for visits to doctors.   And just as I have seen in the countries I visited displays of real anger at charges in education so too I have seen real anger at charges for health care. Just as millions of school age children who have hopes and aspirations for themselves and their country are deprived of their potential, so too millions of people who are sick or injured or simply frail are deprived of the life saving health care they urgently need. <P>Yet when Kenya made education free over one million more children turned up for school. When Uganda made education free numbers in school rose from 2.6 million to 6.5 million in three years. When Malawi introduced free primary education there was an immediate jump in enrolments of 50% - an increase of more than one million children going to school. And when South Africa and Uganda abolished health users fees the poor started to appear in our hospitals and surgeries for treatment. <P>What I want for my child, I want for all children and there is a strong case for children and families not just in some developing countries but in all developing countries enjoying basic health care services free at the point of need based on need not ability to pay. And there is a strong case for recognising that to develop the potential of not just some of our children but all our children, education should be universal and free and so send a message that the best way you can defeat poverty is through free education and free health care available to all. <P>Indeed I believe that the response to the tsunami showed what the debate this year on a new deal for developing countries will show: that, as Rabbi Jonathan Sacks has written, we cannot feast while other starve, we cannot be well while other languish in sickness or disease, we are not truly free when others are in servitude. More than that, as he writes, societies achieve true and enduring greatness not because of the way they help the strong but because of the way they come to the aid of the weak, not by how they acclaim those who have power but by their concern for the powerless - and not by how they reward the wealthy but by the care they show for the poor, and the compassion they show to the vulnerable. <P>And this is what happened in 2000 when first hundreds, then thousands, then millions of people first in one country then in one continent, then in all countries, and in all continents came together to demand an end to the injustice of unpayable debt and in doing so changed the world. And we can do this again. <P>For I believe support for a year of change is growing wider and deeper with already in 'Making Poverty History' more than a hundred aid, development, and trade organisations and anti poverty organisations coming together in demonstrations, campaigns, petitions - in challenging government to make poverty   the issue of the year. <P>And so when people ask whether we can make a difference this year, when they say that our proposals are too difficult, we should reply: doubters thought the original plans for the World Bank were the work of   dreamers; doubters thought that the Marshall Plan unattainable; doubters thought apartheid would last for ever and Nelson Mandela would   never be released; and just as in 1997 doubters thought debt relief an impossible hope,   doubters even in the last year thought no more countries would sign up to a   timetable for 0.7% in overseas development aid and yet in that year   alone five countries have done so. <P>And so next week in this very building I will start my discussions with my G7 colleagues about debt relief, 0.7, the International Finance Facility and funding for trade capacity, education and health.   <P>A few months ago I quoted a century old phrase saying 'the arc of the moral universe is long but it does bend towards justice'. This was not an appeal to some iron law of history but to remind people in the words of a US president that 'the history of free peoples is never written by chance but by choice' - 'that it is by our own actions that people of compassion and goodwill can and do change the world for good'. <P>And I believe that: with our determination not diminished but intensified; with the scale of the challenge revealed; with the clamour of public opinion calling for action now - resonating here in Britain and reverberating across all countries; and with a determination among world leaders to be bold; the arc of the moral universe while indeed long will bend towards justice in the months and years to come. <P>To remind you of Seamus Heaney's poetry about Nelson Mandela's release: \"A further shore is reachable from here...   Once in a lifetime justice can rise up   And hope and history rhyme.\" <P>That is our task, our challenge, our opportunity."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jan/26/development.uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2005/jan/26/development.uk","sectionName":"Politics"},{"webTitle":"Getting down and dirty  in the land of my fathers","webPublicationDate":"2005-01-02T19:03:50Z","sectionId":"travel","id":"travel/2005/jan/02/unitedkingdom.ecotourism.expertopinions","fields":{"body":"<p>Persuading your paramour to travel 250 miles to west Wales to attend a course on sustainable living, missing a 'vintage' weekend of televised sport, is no mean feat. You can only hope that he will be more grateful for such an opportunity in the future when, in the face of global meltdown, he is able to fashion an eco house from waste wood and glass bottles, harness the sun's energy through solar panels and grow his own turnips.</p><p>But, enthused by the lively curriculum offered by this short course, at Clynfyw Countryside Centre in Pembrokeshire, in how to live more sustainably and thus be a better person, the lady's not for turning. So, with only a little sense of irony, we set off in our fossil-fuel-guzzling car to attend a weekend of talks and workshops with titles such as 'The Curse of the Car'.</p><p>Located in the Preseli hills, Clynfyw is not an easy place to get to by public transport, but it can be reached via train and bus - although this might be more comfortable in the warmer months so you won't freeze to death standing at bus stops. However, the good news is that if you do drive, once you've arrived you can forget about your car.</p><p>After the day's lessons in the converted stable block between the main house and the farm, you can amble down a bridleway to the Camra award-winning Nag's Head for supper. And you could combine a visit with a trip to other local eco-attractions, including the Centre for Alternative Technology's farm exhibits in nearby Machynlleth, or the newer Eco Centre at St David's, which has walking trails and exhibitions of farming and food technology.</p><p>When you're learning how to be good to the planet, where you stay is as important as what you learn. It would be counterproductive to spend all day learning how to minimise your ecological footprint and then retire to a luxury pad with manicured lawns (grown using herbicides and mown with petrol mowers) where you might be encouraged to commit eco sins such as wallowing in a deep bath (showers use half the water).</p><p>Clynfyw is the real deal. Waste water is purified through reed beds, the holiday cottages are heated by biomass burners, which use waste wood, solar panels power the electric fence around a field of Welsh Black cattle and there's even a home-grown charcoal project to fuel barbecues in the summer (95 per cent of charcoal is needlessly imported, wiping out mangrove swamps all over the world).</p><p>But worthiness doesn't have to equal discomfort. Accommodation at Clynfyw is very comfortable; former stables and outbuildings have been cleverly converted to make four self-catering holiday cottages, with full disabled access. There's bed and breakfast in the main house, which easily sleeps 16 and can be hired in its entirety.</p><p>Clynfyw is a family farm. Jim Bowen, who manages it with the help of his cousin, Piers Heneker, traces his roots in the area to 1041, and the family has farmed here since 1750. In the world of biodynamics this kind of heritage is important.</p><p>The theory is that the longer you've farmed a piece of land, the more of a link you have with it. Having worked for Voluntary Service Overseas in Kenya for a few years, Bowen realised he wanted to re-establish this link. He was also increasingly worried by society's lack of connection to the natural world. The final straw came when he took a school trip to France and one of his charges asked if a goat was a type of dog. Bowen returned to Clynfyw, started organic conversion in 1998 and worked on creating a holistic education centre.</p><p> Although I managed to avoid similar faux pas during a farm tour, I was thrown by spotting three giant horses. They were, it transpired, Shires, working horses, still pulling their weight on the land. Clynfyw also runs a working horses in woodland course. Keen to seize the opportunity to play farmer, I also signed up for some extracurricular pig farming. At 8am on a drizzly Sunday morning, I was out feeding the Duroc and Saddleback pigs feeling partly virtuous, partly relieved that I was only a pretend farmer.</p><p>Our course is one of the newest additions to the farm. In a converted stable block local experts took us through a ideas and solutions on how we might leave less of an ecological footprint.</p><p>These people practise what they preach, a point driven home when apologies arrive from a speaker trapped at home by the sprout harvest. Organic, seasonal produce waits for no man, or woman in this case, but Dot the sprout farmer sent her husband Bob to deliver the lecture on the shortcomings of supermarkets and the merits of organic production. Then there was the guy who brought traditional Zambian beehives, hollowed out of tree trunks, used to produce Fair Trade honey. We tested the honey enthusiastically. There was a couple advocating compost lavatories, who sometimes pee on their vegetables. Fortunately, we did not have to test their produce.</p><p>We listened to Kaye, a traveller, who has her own portable wind turbine and uses biodiesel (derived from renewable sources such as vegetable oil rather than fossil fuels). A permaculture expert told us how to grow our own food with an inspiring line in eco-philosophy. We got the lowdown on alternative and renewable technologies from Pete, an expert from the Eco Centre, and advice from an engineer who can convert your car engine to run on vegetable oil.</p><p>There was an interesting mix of people hungry for instruction on how to live more sustainably, some with strong views, which made for lively question-and-answer sessions. There was a youth worker from Cardiff, an environmental scientist and an artisan breadmaker who was trying to become a politician. Pleasingly, a few of the people on the course are from the original vanguard of Seventies 'downshifters' who moved to Wales to live the good life. Their guru, John Seymour, writer of The Complete Book of Self Sufficiency, lived down the road until his death at 90 last September.</p><p>Thanks to this heritage and its alternative infrastructure, Clynfyw can call on local celebrities such as Tony Welsh to give us a talk on 'extreme eco-building'. Welsh has pioneered the building of natural roundhouse homes, which avoid ecologically damaging materials such as cement (preferring cob wood, lime, sand and clay mortar, and straw for insulation) and biodegrade in about 30 years. His own roundhouse, which merges into the landscape of Pembrokeshire National Park, is the antithesis to a blot on the landscape. Nevertheless, the county council seems intent on pulling it down, much to the chagrin of viewers of the BBC's    Countryfile,  who recently voted for it to stay. He is a true believer in the alternative lifestyle and is apparently often to be found as nature intended - according to the lady sitting next to me, who remarked: 'The last time I saw him he was completely naked!'</p><p>But to understand how well a roundhouse can work, you need to see one up close. Clynfyw has its own, built by Tony and team at the end of a sculpture trail which weaves through the fields. It's a winner; totally sustainable, impressively put together and beautiful. It could bring out the alternative in the most conservative citizen.</p><p>The same could be said for Clynfyw in general. In place of finger-wagging, and apocalyptic climate-change scenarios, there was boundless enthusiasm, expertise and interesting solutions. Belching back up the motorway, heads spinning with thoughts on sustainability, my husband was talking about running the car on vegetable oil, the missed TV sport a distant memory.</p><p><strong>Fact file</strong></p><p>The two-day sustainability course on  Low Impact Living, at the <a href=\"http://www.clynfyw.co.uk\">Clynfyw Countryside Centre</a> (01239 841236), costs from ?40  per person.

Dominic Crossley-Holland, head of the ITV News Channel, calculates that his network and Sky News lose around &#163;50m between them every year. If you add in the extra &#163;50m spent annually by BBC News 24, it is clear that bringing news to the nation impresses viewers far more than bean counters. </p><p>So it is not surprising that the commercial news channels are looking for new ways to bring in cash. Advertising revenue from loan companies and personal accident lawyers is no longer enough. The hunt is on to bring advertisers out of the commercial breaks and into other parts of the schedule.  </p><p>The media regulator, Ofcom, has just finished a consultation on the rules governing programme sponsorship. Next year its new broadcasting code comes into operation. Many of the news networks are clamouring for the regulations to be eased. \"Clearly you need to put in safeguards to make sure that commercial considerations do not override news considerations,\" says Crossley-Holland. \"I am not suggesting that television news itself becomes sponsored - 'this Iraq report was brought to you in association with Smith &amp; Wesson' - but the rules that govern news channels are prehistoric.\"  </p><p>The regulations are arcane and strict. Direct sponsorship of news or current affairs programmes is banned. But non-news slots within programmes are allowed to carry a sponsor's name - just so long as there is no \"promotional reference\" to a sponsor during any slot it has paid for. Thus a sports report can be brought to you by 02, but not if the presenter happened to mention that the company's logo is present on the Arsenal team's shirts.  </p><p>Last year, the Independent Television Commission, Ofcom's predecessor, banned the business channel CNBC from broadcasting again a series about the positive and negative effects of the euro, which was funded by a &#163;190,000 grant from the European Union.  </p><p>Mark Stephens, the media lawyer who acted for the company, says the EU had no editorial influence on the programme, and there were no complaints that it was one-sided. The ITC ruling was \"illogical\", he says - particularly given that 15 broadcasters across Europe broadcast the programme, \"and there would be nothing to prevent CNBC recording a programme here, squirting it across to Holland or Germany, and uploading it to a satellite there\". Ofcom (and previously the ITC) only govern stations whose signal is uplinked from the UK.  </p><p>Crossley-Holland's main gripe is that though sports and weather reports can   be associated with an outside company - in a so-called \"sponsored belt\" - such a segment cannot be presented by the main news anchor. \"The suggestion that this would skew the news is quite old-fashioned,\" he says.  </p><p>CNN, in particular, is pushing the boundaries as far as they will go, moving beyond the mere sponsorship of market reports or weather forecasts. It has been regularly broadcasting six \"mini-documentaries\" entitled World Sports: A Nation's Passion. The short segments have been paid for by HSBC. Yet they were made not by an advertising agency but by journalists and crew working for CNN. Viewers are not told this explicitly, though they are informed at the beginning and end that the slot was \"brought to you in association with HSBC, the world's local bank\". Other reports in the HSBC-funded series cover boxing in Cuba, long-distance running in Kenya and fencing in France.  </p><p>CNN, perhaps aware of the sensitivities of the genre, calls this \"advertiser collaborative programming\" (ACP). Everyone else in the industry calls it \"advertiser funded programming\".  </p><p>ACP is an enormous wealth creator for the international news network. CNN is also showing Siemens' Mobility Workforce - about how technology is changing the way we work - and Rediscover Lebanon, a series of travelogues. Any firm looking to purchase a handful of ACPs is likely to have to spend a minimum of about &#163;515,000. This year, an extraordinary 30% of CNN's European advertising revenue will come from ACP and programme sponsorship. So   what does CNN mean by \"collaborative\"? Kevin Razvi, executive vice president of advertising sales, is clear about one thing: \"We have 100% editorial control. But what we will do on a collaborative front is be open with a client, show them what we are doing and explain why we are doing it.\"  </p><p>In effect, a company comes to CNN, says it wants to have a show made, and talks begin. Though the client might not have the final say in what gets shown, it is likely to have a loud voice. CNN, whose creative services team make the film, is looking for repeat custom; and in any case its mini-documentaries are not out to win awards or break stories - they are there to provide a sympathetic environment for the sponsoring company. Audience research shows that viewers have a much higher awareness of a brand if it augments its traditional ads with ACPs, says Razvi.  </p><p>The rules of engagement are strict. The boxer in the HSBC film is not seen paying his winnings in at the bank. The Siemens film about technological change does not feature any Siemens computers. Yet is there not still a blurring of the distinction between editorial and advertising? \r\n\"At the risk of sounding pompous, we are very aware that the biggest strength that we have is that CNN is seen as an intelligent, impartial news source with integrity,\" says Razvi. A deal that imperils that might look good in the short term, but \"we would be on a downward slope in terms of future-proofing our business\". Indeed, he says he has turned away business that would have damaged CNN.  </p><p>But not everyone is immediately convinced. Nick Pollard, head of Sky News, says: \"Sky News has sponsored bumpers around the weather and a number of other information spots. We have no plans for advertiser-funded programming.\" Chris Bryant MP, a member of the House of Commons media select committee, says the signposting on such a segment needs to go much further than a mere \"in association with\". \"When I see something like that I want to know, on screen, exactly what editorial involvement &#91;the outside company&#93; has had. People watching television believe that what they are seeing is the unvarnished truth. And if that varnish is being provided by HSBC they need to be made fully aware of that.\"  </p><p>There is another peril facing viewers. ACP is not always the most scintillating television on offer. Which is why CNN's films for HSBC also cover some unusual sports. \"Beach volleyball?\" Razvi laughs. \"The crew really enjoyed making that one.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/dec/20/mondaymediasection10","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/2004/dec/20/mondaymediasection10","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"Obituary: Arthur Howes","webPublicationDate":"2004-12-07T01:31:26Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/2004/dec/07/broadcasting.guardianobituaries","fields":{"body":"<p>Arthur Howes, who has died aged 54 from lung cancer, was an award-winning filmmaker. As an expert on the Sudan, he was often asked for his views during its recent years of political crisis. His documentaries, most of them made on tight budgets, were screened on Channel 4, acclaimed at international festivals and are taught on film courses the world over. </p><p>Filmmaking was only one facet of Arthur's talents (he painted, spoke five languages and was a charismatic storyteller), but his films are his chief legacy, revealing passion and respect for the people he filmed and for cinema itself.  </p><p>His films show keen sensitivity and a knack for engaging people, whether he was working in Brixton (his home for 30 years), the Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, or Brazil in Bacchanalias Bahianas 1-5.  </p><p>He was born and educated in Gibraltar, and migrated to London to find the intellectual and creative stimulation that he craved. He did art and teacher training at Furzedown College, applying his avant-garde interests to experiments with super-8 cameras.  </p><p>In the mid-1970s he did a BA in film studies at the Polytechnic of Central London, where he made Threatened Assassins, a deft fictional work that was influenced both by French New Wave and genres like film noir.  </p><p>Arthur was unafraid to challenge the filmmaking status quo. He had been a teacher in Kadugli, Sudan (1980-82), and in 1984 he brought his experimental technique to the National Film and Television School.  </p><p>Under the tutelage of Colin Young, he came into his own, showing a strong affinity for the fluidity and immediacy of the v&#233;rit&#233; style of Jean Rouch and DA Pennebaker. He made, with Amy Hardie, Kafi's Story (1990), about Sudanese labour and migration from Torogi in the south to Khartoum.  </p><p>It won the BP Expo/BBC Documentary Award, the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival award and other prizes.  </p><p>Despite this, funding was never easy to find and Arthur bemoaned the funding culture at institutions such as the BBC, where documentary seemed to be valued only if it had heightened dramatics, voyeuristic intrusion, and the heroic presence of on-camera directors.  </p><p>Arthur had a great love for celluloid aesthetics, but adapted brilliantly to digital technology. The filmmaker, carrying his camera, could now move across borders with the ease of a tourist, and Arthur took full advantage of this, making Oromo - Human Rights (1996) in Ethiopia and Kenya, and Nuba Conversations (2000), in the Kenyan refugee camp at Kakuma and across the war-damaged regions of Sudan, where 60,000 Nuba children had been abducted to \"peace camps\" and then forcibly recruited into the Sudanese army.  </p><p>Nuba Conversations showed Arthur's gift for putting people of all walks of life at their ease; his empathy for human suffering; his hatred of injustice; and his unwavering photographic eye, which captured life in all its beauty and tragedy.  </p><p>The Village Voice called it \"searing journalism and a document of what has to many western eyes remained an invisible cataclysm\". A Nairobi screening helped inspire UN ceasefire talks between the Sudanese government and the SPLM (Sudanese People's Liberation Movement).  </p><p>Benjamin And His Brother (2002) returned to Kakuma, further tracing Sudanese displacement and forced migrations. It follows two young men in their attempts to emigrate to the US; only one manages to secure visas for the journey, leading to a painful separation. Benjamin found wide success, including screening at New York's Margaret Mead Festival, the Pacific Film Archives in Berkeley, and Brixton's Ritzy.  </p><p>Arthur, always interested in other media, was visual director for the multimedia shows Kaddish (1995) and Physical Cinema (1999), mounted by the avant-garde group Towering Inferno; produced videos for the \"krautrock\" band, Faust; and did installations for London nightclubs.  </p><p>He taught film for years at Brixton College, and also held posts at Essex University, Napier University, Edinburgh, and the London College of Printing. He was an inspiring teacher who encouraged students to make documentaries as far afield as West Africa and Ethiopia, and wrote scholarly pieces on documentary history and theory.  </p><p>Arthur's last, unreleased, work is a meditation on his battle with lung cancer while in Bahia, Brazil. Highly experimental, it visualises his deterioration in health, as the camera becomes progressively heavier and the images grow increasingly painterly and static.  </p><p>In many ways it brought his life and career full circle, returning to the world of the African diaspora, to the pleasures of light, food and the body; and to the sea, which he always associated with his beloved home, Gibraltar.  </p><p>He is survived by his son, Eli Hardie-Howes. </p><p><strong>&amp;#183</strong> Arthur Christopher Joseph Howes, filmmaker, born July 15 1950; died November 29 2004</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/dec/07/broadcasting.guardianobituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/2004/dec/07/broadcasting.guardianobituaries","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"Grimewatch","webPublicationDate":"2004-11-21T00:49:30Z","sectionId":"culture","id":"theobserver/2004/nov/21/features.review67","fields":{"body":"<p><strong> North and South </strong> BBC1 </p><p><strong> Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets </strong> BBC1  </p><p><strong> Lie with Me</strong> ITV1  </p><p><strong>Who Do You Think You Are? </strong> BBC2  </p><p><strong> Dispatches </strong> C4  </p><p><strong>Malaria: Fever Road </strong> BBC4   </p><p> AS WITH the phrase 'Adapted by Andrew Davies', Pauline Quirke in a pinny is a reliable signifier of the classy primetime costume drama, so I knew straight away that BBC1's <strong> North and South</strong>, adapted by Sandy Welch (the Andrea Davies of adaptations) from the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, was going to be pretty-good-if-you-like-that-sort-of-thing.  </p><p>But do we still like that sort of thing, especially given that Mrs Gaskell doesn't operate in Austen country?

The acting's bang-on, it's stunning to look at, the dialogue is deliciously adapted ('I think I have seen Hell -    and it is white, snow white...') and it's always good to be reminded that there was more to Victorian women than their balls. But I don't hold out very much hope for Part 2 tonight, up against the Stephenson's Rocket of ratings that is ITV1's I'm A Celebrity....   </p><p>At the opposite end of the televisual spectrum I found myself inadvertently gripped by the concluding part of BBC1's CGI-tastic <strong> Space Odyssey</strong>, which was pitched at an audience aged between those of  The Right Stuff and  The Clangers and had a    soundtrack which cleverly evoked  Star Trek, thus it had everything, other than Bruce Willis, you could expect of a classy space opera.  </p><p>En route to Pluto, the crew navigated their ship past Jupiter's clouds (the size of continents), hurricanes (that rage for centuries) and 60 moons in order to have a quick rendezvous with Io, described as 'a grumpy piece of rock - even the gravity's uneven...' Later, one crew member was sent off to infinity and beyond, spinning through the Russ Abbottsphere and   wearing a tinfoil shroud after having suffered a bit of death-by-radiation. 'I've put some eggs aside for safe keeping,' explained a female astronaut in a businesslike sort of way, and I don't think she was talking about the sort you'd want to scramble.  </p><p>There was a tiny bit of rebelliousness-bordering-on- insurrection in the astronautical ranks when the prospect of spending the whole of Year 4 gazing longingly at, while not ever being allowed to touch, their hard-won rock samples resulted in some wilfully experimen tal contamination. But, hey, on a space lab, you get your kicks where you can - like deciding to land on a comet, for example.  </p><p>Despite lo-tech dialogue of the 'you'd better get back before your jets choke' variety, I was completely seduced by  Space Odyssey and kept shouting stuff like: 'No, no, aargh! You don't want to do that...  mind the bloody rock .' But then my first love was, and will therefore always remain, Captain James T Kirk (and, yes, whenever I see Shatner bloating his way through some irony TV ad campaign, that fact does disturb me greatly).  </p><p>Elsewhere, away from the drama of industrial accidents and grinding poverty and the loneliness of the long-distance astronaut and your common-or-garden ITV1 two-part murder mystery thingy, <strong> Lie With Me</strong> - which, if you find the idea of Andrew Lincoln as a copper remotely plausible, started off quite strongly but then became very, very silly indeed (to the point where the biggest mystery was why, having gone to the trouble of securing his services, the excellent Paul McGann only got to appear   in Part 1?) - it was a terrifically good week for intense, and occasionally intensely miserable, documentaries.  </p><p>BBC2's celebrity-genealogy series <strong> Who Do You Think You Are?</strong> has been a big success for the Beeb and this is almost certainly due to a seductive new combination of hit TV genres - interiors and history. Each week we kick off with a  Hello! -style glimpse into a famous person's pleasantly posh kitchen before being shunted out again and taken on a journey which often reveals that the subject's family origins are considerably humbler than either their accents or their Agas.  </p><p>Last week, after we'd had a quick tour of the kitchen (wooden units, butler's sink, yellow walls_), Moira Stuart was claiming to be 'a true mongrel and proud of it' before taking us with her to   Edinburgh, the Cairngorms, Dominica and Antigua as she traced her family tree.  </p><p>By the end Stuart had to face up to the fact that the 'mongrelism' of which she was so proud had had it's origins in her enslaved great great-great-grandfather's too-close-for-comfort relationship to the owners of an Antiguan sugar-cane plantation. Moira carefully articulated - unsurprising, given that hardly anybody on television articulates more carefully than Moira - the 'rage within me. And a guilt that my family were closer &#91;than the rest of the slaves&#93; to the Big House.' It was very touching. There's no reason why  Who Do You Think You Are? shouldn't make a comeback next year, and for many years after that.  </p><p>Channel 4's <strong> Dispatches </strong> returned on Thursday with reporter Brian Deer's skilfully crafted hatchet-job on Andrew Wakefield, the British doctor who was the architect of the MMR scare. Wakefield has since decamped to Florida, where Deer attempted to catch up with him at his grandly titled International Child Development Resource Centre but on the way we were introduced to numerous   people who made mincemeat of Wakefield's original controversial 'research' while at London's Royal Free Hospital.  </p><p>There was some compelling testimony that Wakefield was not merely wrong in claiming a connection between MMR and, specifically, the measles virus, inflammation of the gut and the subsequent development of autistic spectrum disorders, but actually went out of his way to discount the evidence that there was no link - at least if one gave credence to one of his whistleblowing former researchers, Dr Nicholas Chadwick.  </p><p>And if this weren't bad enough, Wakefield had patented a bizarre-sounding autism 'cure' which called to mind a scene from C4's  Crazy Rulers of the World.  </p><p>'But what about the pregnant goat technology? Where does that come from?' mused Brian Deer as he morphed into Jon Ronson and went off to the US to interview a wheelchair-bound septuagenarian Professor Fedenberg who looked like Hunter S Thompson's dad and was described by Deer as 'the grandfather of the MMR scare'. Needless to say, Fedenberg's claim that children could be cured of autism by taking supplements containing  his own bone-marrow didn't inspire confidence, nor did Deer's eventual confrontation with Wakefield at an autism conference in Indianapolis.  </p><p>This film was designed to make anybody who has chosen single vaccines for their children feel like complete bloody fools (next thing we know they'll be force-feeding toddlers with EPA-rich marine fish oils in a bid to turn them into chess grandmasters. So I've, ahem, heard), but what it didn't do was attempt to explain why, given that Wakefield is obviously so wrong, there has been such a sharp rise in the diagnosis of autism. But I guess that wouldn't have been quite so much fun.  </p><p>July is dubbed 'malaria month' in the hill village of Kiagware, western Kenya. When the children start falling ill and the dubious talents of the herbalists and unqualified local quack doctors fail them, the fine village chief, Peter Kombo, regularly treks for hours (the village is a four-hour walk from the nearest  road) to seek help.  </p><p>As with measles, nobody needs to die of malaria in the 21st century, but the problems facing the people of Kiagware are the opposite of those facing western parents consumed by fears of MMR - in Africa it is a fundamental lack of information that is destroying lives, and there's no excuse for that. BBC4's heartbreaking and powerfully understated two-parter, <strong> Malaria</strong>, by Kevin Hull, captured the desperate stoicism and torpor of life in malaria-riddled Africa, and if you missed it I strongly urge you to seek it out again when it is repeated in December.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/nov/21/features.review67","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2004/nov/21/features.review67","sectionName":"Culture"},{"webTitle":"Industry and energy efficiency","webPublicationDate":"2004-11-03T00:49:10Z","sectionId":"society","id":"society/2004/nov/03/environment.environment2","fields":{"body":"<p>Business and industry are responsible for more than a third of the UK's total carbon emissions, but it seems the reality of climate change is proving tricky for the nation's corporates or the government to grasp. </p><p>Last week, environment secretary Margaret Beckett announced that industry would be allowed to emit 19.8m tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next three years, an effective three-year moratorium on doing anything under the emissions trading scheme. Environment groups were furious, calling it a \"sell-out\", a \"stitch-up\" and a \"let-off\". \"This is another example of how vested interests with loud voices and deep pockets can drive policy in the wrong direction,\" says Greenpeace director Stephen Tindale.  </p><p>But the industry says the energy conservation message is getting through and that real change is coming. \"Price is only one factor,\" says Tom Delay, director of the Carbon Trust, which helps companies cut emissions. \"The idea of improving energy efficiency is gaining currency. However, if you're talking at a senior level, just to express it as a cost saving doesn't have much weight, because responsibility for energy procurement usually rests with middle management. When it becomes risk management and the future viability of the company, it's then that you can engage with the CEO and the board.\"  </p><p>The trust recently looked into the effects of climate change on 51 of the UK's biggest companies including Rolls Royce, Tesco, Bank of Scotland, GlaxoSmithKline and Severn Trent. It found that three major risk factors are now converging to concentrate minds on the need for action, says Delay.  </p><p>\"There's the physical risk to the business - storms, droughts, floods. This is relevant to building and property companies. Then there's compliance risk, with the imminent European Emissions Trading Scheme, the UK's climate change levy and the Kyoto protocol. It's a lousy protocol, but it does provide a platform for action, and helps legitimise the decisions of organisations   that have taken pre-emptive measures. Thirdly, 'How is my business at risk in the long term if the consumer turns against me?' If you're worried, as a supermarket chain, that consumers are not going to want beans flown in from Kenya, if it becomes chic to only buy fresh vegetables that are locally sourced, how do you cover that risk?\"  </p><p>By delving into the companies' energy management, the trust identified &#163;150m worth of risk relating to climate change, without touching on the risk to brand reputation. Financial opportunities worth &#163;25m from addressing climate change issues were identified, together with the potential to cut 5m tonnes of CO2 - 1% of the UK's total annual carbon emissions.  </p><p>It found that a quarter of that cut could come from companies generating renewable power on site. \"That surprised me, having thought that renewables were only a realistic prospect through the big energy suppliers,\" says Delay. \"We forget that renewable power is expensive to buy retail, but not expensive if you generate it yourself.\"  </p><p>Even at retail prices, wind power makes good business sense to Ford's management team, which this year asked green power company Ecotricity to install two turbines at its Dagenham site. Designed to offset all the energy used by a new plant, the turbines will save 6,000 tonnes of CO2 annually.  </p><p>Andy Taylor, Ford's corporate citizenship director, said the business case was far from clear. \"Sometimes it has to be an act of faith. When we approved the turbines, it was a significant cost. But management took a long view that energy prices were likely to go up. Now, the cost is comparable with brown energy, and we're all thinking, 'Wasn't that a bloody good decision!'\"  </p><p>Despite the Confederation of British Industry's complaints that UK businesses are hard done by, with emissions targets tougher than those required by Kyoto, some companies are simply getting down to the unglamorous work of changing wasteful habits.  </p><p>In five years, Nigel Trotman, fleet manager, has transformed the efficiency of Whitbread's 900 company   cars. \"Basically, I went to senior management and said, 'Would you like to save a lot of money?'\" he says. With advice from the trust, Whitbread offered financial benefits to any employee who chose a car that did more than 40mpg.  </p><p>Combined with technology that encouraged working from out of the office, the company makes annual savings of &#163;300,000 on fuel and has cut CO2 emissions from 8.4 tonnes per car to 6.6 tonnes. Electric hybrids have just been introduced, offering even lower emissions, as well as tax benefits for employer and employee. \"What I've realised is that if you take the right decision for environmental reasons, then it's going to be right for the business as well,\" says Trotman.  </p><p>Whether the UK's 3.7m businesses with fewer than 50 employees are considering climate change is another matter. A Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) survey this year showed that fewer than 25% of its members were aware of the impact of environmental legislation on their operations.  </p><p> John Holbrow, head of the FSB environmental policy unit, says the climate change levy - the tax on all businesses that is charged according to energy use - is seen as a stealth tax on small businesses that cannot negotiate lower prices on energy like bigger ones can. He believes small businesses feeling the regulatory pinch simply shop around for better tariffs rather than trying to become more energy efficient.  </p><p>But this is counter-productive, says Gary Felgate, the Carbon Trust's director of business delivery. \"For a business, reducing energy use is the best way of reducing your carbon emissions,\" he says. \"The biggest barrier is behavioural change, and it is the most critical area to address. Where we have noticed success is where business has engaged with the workforce.  </p><p>\"Staff then feel some pride that their actions have an impact on the community where they live, and they feel empowered to take action for change in their own environment.\" </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> The Carbon Trust offers advice, grants and loans to companies and public sector organisations.

Concerns have been raised over the authenticity of the \"miracles\" by the fact that where the children's DNA as tested by the Kenyan authorities, it did not match their mothers'.  </p><p>In a statement, Mr Deya, whose church is a registered charity and boasts a new &#163;1m headquarters in Peckham, yesterday insisted he and his family were innocent and the allegation that they had \"stolen our baby Naomi\" was untrue.  </p><p>\"Naomi was a twin with the late Jeremiah and we have proof of their birth in the video camera,\" he said. \"The allegation is a lie, an assassination attempt and it has been fabricated to destroy the name of my ministry, which is well-known and respected worldwide.\"  </p><p>Mr Deya claims to use prayer to exorcise demons from women in his ministry who are unable to conceive naturally. According to the pastor, British doctors in his congregation have confirmed the miracle births are genuine. \"The miracles which God has performed through me are of God, they are beyond human understanding and no man can explain them except God,\" he said.</p><p>A second British woman, Miriam Nyeko, and Rose Kiserem, a Kenyan, also appeared in the chief magistrate's court in Kenya with Mrs Deya. All three are charged with stealing a child from the Pumwani maternity hospital, Nairobi, in February this year.  </p><p>Mrs Nyeko said she gave birth to her third child, Daniel, in Kenya last month with help from Mr Deya. Her husband, Charles, said the birth was a \"miracle from God\".  </p><p>Mr Deya said he had presented pictures and a videotape of Mrs Nyeko's birth to the British embassy in Nairobi with an application for travel documents so the couple could bring their \"miracle baby\" back to Britain. But the embassy has refused to grant the boy a passport until DNA tests, also demanded by the Kenyan authorities, are carried out.  </p><p>Also appearing in court were Michael and Eddah Odera, a Kenyan couple who describe how they gave birth to \"miracle babies\" on Mr Deya's website. Charged with abducting a teenage boy from a farm 90 miles from Nairobi in 2000, the couple were found to have 11 children aged between five months and 12 years living in their home in Kenya.  </p><p>Mr Odera said his 56-year-old wife gave birth to the first of their miracle babies after Mrs Deya prophesied a birth and laid her hand on his wife's stomach.

What a shame they have not had the courage to find a robust solution to the problems of medical migration. </p><p>The figures speak for themselves. Over the past four years about 40,000 overseas nurses have registered to work in the UK, mostly from the Philippines, South Africa, Australia and India. The government has no clear information on how many came to work in the NHS, private hospitals and the more shadowy world of independent care homes. But it is clear that ministers could not have achieved their targets for expanding the workforce without this influx of talent.  </p><p>Some of the exporting countries appear not to mind. For example, the Filipino authorities plan to train a surplus of nurses in the expectation that many will go to work abroad, remitting part of their income back to their families.  </p><p>But the drain is a real problem for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Latest figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council show that 6,028 South African nurses registered to work in Britain over the four years to April 2003. Thembeka Gwagwa, chief officer of Denosa, the South African nurses' association, told the Royal College of Nursing's annual congress in May that her country's health service was short of 1,000 nurses and losing 300 a month. The loss of even a handful of key staff could be enough to destroy a rural maternity service or Aids clinic.  </p><p>Other countries suffering from poaching are Zimbabwe, which had 1,561 nurses join the UK register over the past four years, Nigeria (1,496), Ghana (660), Zambia (444), Kenya (386), Botswana (226) and Malawi (192). Health ministers have been well aware of the problem and, to their credit, took a lead in offering solutions. Three years ago, in response to pressure from Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, they banned the NHS from running recruitment fairs in developing countries.  </p><p>A code of practice on ethical recruitment was brought in to stop NHS organisations hiring from developing countries unless there was an intergovernmental agreement to permit it - as there is, for example, with India.   </p><p>More than 170 agencies supplying the NHS with staff were required to sign up to the code if they wanted to stay in business with the health service - supposedly stopping them poaching on the NHS's behalf. But this did not stop the flow. There was nothing to prevent private hospitals and care homes recruiting in the banned countries. And nothing to stop nurses moving from those private institutions into the NHS at a later date.  </p><p>The NHS could argue that its hands were clean. The nursing unions, which were anxious about the immorality of poaching, were firm believers in the right of nurses to seek professional development in another country. Any attempt to deny individual mobility would have been seen as an outrage.  </p><p>But it mattered little to Aids patients in South Africa or Botswana whether their clinic closed because the staff were hoovered up directly by the NHS, or because they left on a more circuitous route via the private sector. A simple answer might have been to impose the code on the private sector. But John Reid, the health secretary, said that would not be possible \"without a complex and intrusive legislative programme\". As he sought rapprochement with the private firms, he was in no mood for that. So the exodus continued and - until health minister John Hutton's visit to South Africa this week - looked set to increase.  </p><p>Bizarrely, the government ruled that foundation hospitals should be exempt from the anti-poaching rules and merely be \"invited\" to adopt an ethical approach. Since all acute NHS trusts are due to gain foundation status within four years, the compulsory ban looked set to wither away.  </p><p>On Wednesday, Mr Hutton went some way to revive the policy. As an incentive to behave more ethically, private employers will get access to the government's overseas recruitment channels if they sign up to the code. The NHS will not be allowed to recruit nurses from developing countries on renewable temporary contracts to evade the ban on hiring permanent staff. About 200 agencies will be told they cannot supply the NHS with British staff if they are poaching for the private sector.  </p><p>The Royal College of Nursing says this fails to tackle the real issue. It wants the private hospitals to be made to operate by the same rules as the NHS, thereby closing the back door that has allowed poaching to thrive. Since ministers have no intention of conceding, there appears only one other way forward. It is to accept that developing countries exporting scarce staff should be compensated for doing so through transfer of technology, skills and financial assistance.  </p><p>The Department of Health does not like the sound of this. Less than half the Commonwealth agrees, it says. Some developed countries might end up compensating each other. And if we compensated for poaching nurses, why not for builders, plumbers and other skilled workers? Why not indeed? The choice is between stopping our unethical behaviour or compensating for it.  </p><p>And the story may yet have a sting in the tail. Until now, Britain has been the most powerful player in the poaching game, but that role is set to pass to the US. The NHS may be about to lose staff - both British and overseas - to the lure of the dollar.  </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> John Carvel is the Guardian's social affairs editor  </p><p><a href=\"mailto:john.carvel@guardian.co.uk\">john.carvel@guardian.co.uk</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/aug/27/nhsstaff.health","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2004/aug/27/nhsstaff.health","sectionName":"Society"},{"webTitle":"Eco sounding","webPublicationDate":"2004-08-04T00:38:31Z","sectionId":"society","id":"society/2004/aug/04/environment.environment1","fields":{"body":"<p><strong> Friends like these </strong><br /> \r\nPeter Harper and Paul Allen from the Centre for Alternative Technology, talking at the Gaia and global change meeting at Dartington Hall, Devon, started with the premise that: \"The worst possible nuclear disasters are not as bad as the worst possible climate change disasters.\" Much later they said: \"What we suggest now (at the risk of becoming pariahs in the official green community) is to debate the following scheme: that we start with a modest revival of nuclear energy in sites where there are already nuclear installations, where local jobs make people sympathetic to the idea.

It may be at his luxury estate in Kenya, lolling on a yacht offshore from his mega-rich Billionaire Club in Sardinia's Costa Smeralda, or wandering the pits at Monte Carlo where Jarno Trulli, one of the formula one drivers he personally manages, won the Monaco grand prix on Sunday. </p><p>With his spectacular shock of grey hair and his 6ft frame, the 54-year-old Briatore cuts an imposing figure. Part businessman, part playboy, the Renault team principal works hard and plays harder. Off track, he is an unapologetic hedonist, featuring in the gossip columns and lifestyle magazines, often with a supermodel on his arm. Once his cars have taken the chequered flag, he lets his hair down.  </p><p>\"For me it is important to get the result on the track,\" he says. \"It makes no difference whether or not I'm going out with a supermodel. But after that I feel it's my life to enjoy. If you are successful and you work hard, then it's fair to have time to myself. Why not?  </p><p>\"I never use the company jet to go and see girls. It's used for what we're doing, Monday, Tuesday in Paris, Wednesday, Thursday in London, races, promotions. The jet is a working tool. Anyway, I have my own business as well. I have a few clubs doing very well - the Billionaire Club in Sardinia with the Cipriani restaurant, &#91;and&#93; we've just opened a Cipriani in London and there's a little club in Tuscany.\"  </p><p>It would be easy for Briatore to get distracted from his day job but he has become one of the most astute and influential of formula one powerbrokers largely, perhaps, because he freely admits he is no fan of motor racing and therefore can see the sport's problems in sharper focus than many of his more exalted colleagues.  </p><p>\"When I first came into formula one in 1989 &#91;as Benetton team principal&#93; it was really a game for engineers,\" he said. \"It was a battle for technology. But it always seemed to me that we were rather missing the point. Here was a huge international show, a global televised event, yet nobody seemed to be thinking about their public.  </p><p>\"We had developed all this fantastic technology and nobody cared. I mean, we're now embroiled in a major discussion about whether we should have 2.4- or 3-litre engines. Well, I mean, the consumer, the spectator, couldn't care less about the difference. They just want to see a race, a tight race.  </p><p>\"Formula one is very special, it's unique. It's a mix of technology, a touch of glamour, rich and famous people, colour and spectacle. Technology has its place but it's only part of the package.\"  </p><p>Briatore worked on the Milan stock exchange in the early 1970s at a time when the Benetton knitwear empire started its spectacular growth. In 1979 the Treviso-based company opened its first five stores in the United States and three years later Briatore took charge of the marketing operation there. In 1989 Luciano Benetton asked him to take a look at their struggling formula one team. He went to the Australian grand prix, saw it through a shopkeeper's eyes and took the job as team principal.  </p><p>\"I entered formula one from a different background, a different area,\" he said. \"When I came into the sport my colleagues, the people around me, had been breathing the formula one exhaust fumes for many years. My first impression was that there was a huge fascination about the formula one businesss. But why weren't we taking advantage of that? And why wasn't it possible to put on such a good show at half the price? Our product is incredibly expensive and the customer doesn't understand why it is so expensive.  </p><p>\"I knew nothing at all about formula one before I came into the sport. But my commercial schooling was with Benetton, a very aggressive company. For us the product was super- important, because we were selling millions of items. But marketing was very important as well. But in formula one nobody talked about marketing or lifestyle. Only technology, technology, technology.\"  </p><p>Briatore not only masterminded Michael Schumacher's emergence, presiding over his world championships for   Benetton in 1994 and 1995, but grew rich through his driver management portfolio which includes Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber as well as Trulli.  </p><p>\"I met Trulli for the first time in Monaco in 1994 after we were celebrating our world championship with Michael Schumacher and he was a champion in karting,\" he said. \"We started looking after Jarno in formula three in the German championship and he has been with us ever since. After driving for Minardi, Prost and Jordan he joined Renault in 2002 and I think he was a little shocked by it all, but he developed the confidence to get the most out of his talent.  </p><p>\"It was the same with Alonso. I took over his contract with Minardi, who had made a contract with him in 1999. He was the only one I had to put money on the table to buy the contract, and at the time I took a big risk because it was a lot of money. So it was an investment, just like when you buy on the stock market. You expect it to go up, but it can go down as well.  </p><p>\"Two years ago I suggested to several teams to take Webber but the only person to recognise he was special was Niki Lauda when he was team principal of Jaguar. Now everybody wants him. Amazing. Sometimes I don't understand the mentality of these people.  </p><p>\"You need to have a driver who will grow with the team. And remember that it wasn't only Michael &#91;Schumacher&#93; that we developed into race winners during my time with Benetton. We also did it for Nelson Piquet, Alessandro Nannini, Johnny Herbert and now with Fernando Alonso and Jarno at Renault.\"  </p><p>With Trulli's success last weekend, Briatore's golden touch seems to be working again, but will he get carried away?  </p><p>\"Yes, I enjoy my life. This is my free time. But I don't take this whole business too seriously. People in formula one make too much of a fuss. Just now we have a real drama in our team. Our head of aerodynamics Dino &#91;Toso&#93; - he's superbly fit and never smoked - is now seriously ill. This is a real drama, believe me. Compared with this, everything else - racing, business and the clubs - just doesn't matter.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/may/29/formulaone.comment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2004/may/29/formulaone.comment","sectionName":"Sport"},{"webTitle":"Heaven on Earth","webPublicationDate":"2004-05-02T15:41:32Z","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","id":"lifeandstyle/2004/may/02/ethicalliving.gardens","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Plant a seed</strong><br />Sunflowers, pumpkins, pansies, radishes, cress and even lettuce... all of these plants are quick and very easy to grow, and they'll help make gardening come alive for young children.

It's a promise that will mean providing an education for the more than 100 million children in the world currently denied one. It upholds the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), which enshrines the right of every child to an education. </p><p>The Global Campaign for Education (GCE) has just completed a week of action for education, to ensure that the pledge does not become another empty promise. The GCE, an international coalition of civil groups including Oxfam and Save the Children, has the right to be sceptical. The same promise was made 10 years earlier in Thailand - and not kept.  </p><p>  <strong>150 years to wait</strong><br /> </p><p>The commitment made at Dakar signalled a clear intention, but left much of the detail, such as the amount of money required and how it is to be raised, undecided. It has been estimated that &#163;3.3bn is all that is required to meet this promise - what the world spends on arms every few days. However, Oxfam estimates that, at current rates of progress, it will take 150 years before all the world's children have a place in school.  </p><p>Last week children and young people across the world participated in the \"biggest ever lobby\". Tens of thousands of politicians across the world engaged in talks with young people about the importance of education.  </p><p><strong> Lobbying parliament</strong><br /> </p><p>In the UK, hundreds of children gathered in London to lobby Hilary Benn and Charles Clarke, respectively secretaries of state for international development and education. And for MPs, April 23 was \"back to school day\", when they were invited into their local schools to discuss the issue.  </p><p>The week of action has provided a platform for raising our awareness of the millions of children who do not have access to education. The issue does not go away and the campaigning continues. This week is Save the Children Week and their \"skip a treat\" campaign aims to raise money for educating the world's poorest children.  </p><p>The current focus can also be used by schools and teachers as a springboard for considering this basic citizenship and human rights issue more deeply and extensively in the classroom. Helpful resource packs with teaching ideas and case studies can be ordered or downloaded from the GCE website and Oxfam's Cool Planet website (<a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/coolplanet\">http://www.oxfam.org/coolplanet</a>).  </p><p><strong> Look at me, look at you</strong><br /> </p><p>For students in the UK, this is not only an opportunity to look at a very important issue, it's a chance to reflect upon their own lifestyles and life chances, to find out about taking action themselves and to form links with young people throughout the world.  </p><p>The initial challenge for the teacher is to encourage students to consider the benefits of education. Probably the easiest way to do this is to ask them to imagine they had no education; to think about their family and work out the consequences. They can create a tree diagram or mindmap in which the branches relate to different areas of their life such as home, leisure, health, job, etc. The idea is to show how everything else is dependent on education.  </p><p>The resource packs give case studies of children in other countries who are facing the stark reality of no proper education. Students can use these snapshots of life to put their own situations into context, to examine the roots of the problems, to role-play and empathise, and to discuss how change can be brought about. Ask them to identify the root cause of lack of education (poverty).  </p><p><strong> A basic human right</strong><br /> </p><p>Move on to a consideration of what human rights are, and ask them to write a list of five basic rights that should apply to each child in the world. Allow them to compare their lists with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (see GCE resource pack). Then discuss our international responsibilities and what action they think should be taken when human rights are ignored.  </p><p>Use a flow chart or devise a card sort to establish channels of influence, and how they personally can put pressure on their representatives (MPs, MEPs, etc) to bring about change.  </p><p>      <strong> Global citizenship</strong><br /> </p><p>Challenge students to find out about education in other countries. If the school or area has links with other countries, this would be a good starting place and a focus for correspondence. Students can exchange information on schools, discuss issues, describe their journeys to school, etc.  </p><p>A growing number of schools have links with schools in developing countries. Such connections can give students real insight into citizenship. An example of this is a partnership (supported by the British Council) set up between three schools in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, and three schools in Kenya. With money raised by students, Kenyan students have recently visited the Forest of Dean schools. Such long-term links can promote real global citizenship - with students, parents and the whole community becoming more globally aware. As Iain Baird from Dene Magna, one of the schools involved, observed, \"When Kenyan and British students debated: 'Is Britain a perfect society?' it made both sets of students really reflect hard on their perceptions of society.\"   </p><p><strong>Learnnewsdesk forLondon</strong> </p><p>London schools can now access the learnnewsdesk for London from the London Grid for Learning (LGfL) website, <a href=\"http://www.lgfl.net\">www.lgfl.net</a>.

Once they have shared their thoughts, ask them to create a poem based on their ideas. This might be a class poem, with each student contributing one line, or individual poems. The poem might take many forms, for example an acrostic based on the letters of the word education or a haiku.  </p><p>Investigate some of the case studies and encourage students to discuss the lives of the children depicted. Next ask students to choose one of the children and create a cartoon strip that shows a day in the life of the child. This will necessitate doing a bit of research into life in that country.  </p><p>Ask students what would make a good international symbol for education, eg a particular animal or flower. They can move on to consider an idea for a campaign on how to remind children in this country that not all children have an education.  </p><p><strong> Key stage 4 (age 14-15)</strong>   </p><p>As an individual it can seem hard to take action on global issues, but it is possible. Discuss with students the different kinds of actions people take (eg lobbying, letter-writing, fundraising), and the pros and cons of such actions.  </p><p>Joining up with others is by far the most effective way of making a difference. This is why different groups have signed up to the Global Campaign for Education. Again, discuss the strengths of working with others to make a difference, and then ask students to design a leaflet that will advise young people on taking action on an issue.  </p><p>Finally, ask students to choose one of these quotations on education, and annotate around it with all the possible meanings. Then use it as the starting point and inspiration for a brief speech to the class on education:  </p><p>* \"Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world\" (Nelson Mandela)  </p><p>* \"Only the educated are free\" (Epictetus, philosopher of ancient Rome)  </p><p>* \"I would set up education for the poorer children, which would cost them nothing.

Many also appear to hold the view that if Britain, Spain, Poland, France and other states were to withdraw their forces from Afghanistan and Iraq, this would remove the principal casus belli in their relations with al-Qaida. Such persons reasonably conclude that the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the continued presence there of coalition forces, have made the countries that contributed those forces less safe. <P>So are we less safe now than we were before the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan? Yes, because we have exposed forces in both these countries; because we have aroused the ire of many Muslims and others who may now be willing to take up arms against us; and because some time has passed without the destruction of al-Qaida. It must be presumed that al-Qaida has used this time to plan further attacks and to reconstitute itself after the worldwide arrests that disrupted its organisation.  <P>But whether we are safer now than three years ago is not the right question. Such an inquiry is a prime example of what might be called \"Parmenides's fallacy\" - named (a little unfairly) after the Greek philosopher who held that all change was illusion. This fallacy occurs when one tries to assess a state of affairs by measuring it against the past, as opposed to comparing it to other possible present states of affairs.   <P>The real question is this: are we - the US, the UK, Spain, Italy, Poland and the rest - better off today than we would have been if we hadn't gone into Afghanistan and Iraq in order to remove the regimes there?  <P>Consider the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. Are we better off now than we were the day before we intervened? Probably not. Before that war we knew where al-Qaida had its bases, and it had not struck since September 11; our soldiers who became casualties were then alive and well; there was a greater measure of sympathy around the world for our losses in New York and Washington; and the American economy was stronger.  <P>But are we better off today than we would have been if we had let the Taliban continue arming and sheltering our al-Qaida enemies, many of whom we killed and captured? Clearly, we are vastly better off for having acted, not least because our capture of documents and interrogation of prisoners has allowed us to prevent so many attacks that would otherwise have taken place.  <P>Are we better off today than if Saddam Hussein were still in power, seeking nuclear weapons technology on the black market? For that was always the crucial issue - not whether he was to be punished for acquiring WMD, but whether he could be removed before he actually got nuclear arms, thus making his regime impervious to pressure for change? Clearly we - to say nothing of the Iraqi people - are vastly better off for having acted, for we now know the extent of the black market trade that could have bypassed the years of development that an indigenous nuclear programme would have required.  <P>But don't take my word for it. Rather listen to Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida, for they gave us definitive testimony last week in Madrid.  <P>The reason that al-Qaida objects to the reconstruction of Afghanistan is clear. Bin Laden can no longer use the state as a safe haven from which to train fighters and plan operations. If he still had this asset, he would hardly be less threatening, nor we more safe. That is why he is trying to compel coalition forces to leave.  <P>With respect to the demand that other coalition troops leave Iraq, there is a similar self-interest. Bin Laden doesn't want 150,000 well-armed troops in bases from where they can support pro-western governments. This is not because he values Iraq's sovereignty or regrets the callousness with which international law is treated by Washington; if he had his way, Iraq and many other states would be subsumed into a Talibanised theocratic empire. Iraq's occupation makes it harder for him to operate in the region.  <P>The US, Kenya and Tanzania were all attacked by al-Qaida before the invasions of Afghanistan or Iraq. Bali, Morocco, Turkey and Tunisia have all been attacked since, despite the fact that their governments had nothing to do with supporting coalition efforts. Al-Qaida has grievances and ambitions beyond Afghanistan and Iraq. Just as the struggle of the Palestinians was tacked on to al-Qaida's manifestos, it is folly to think that the late arrival of concern for the sovereignty of Iraq exhausts Bin Laden's preoccupations, or that if al-Qaida occupied Kabul and Baghdad and Jerusalem, its ambitions would be slaked.  <P>Finally, we should not forget Bin Laden's statements about the US withdrawal from Lebanon. I opposed US intervention there in the early 1980s, but I also opposed our abrupt withdrawal. It was this withdrawal, Bin Laden has said, that persuaded him that if the US were confronted, it would run, abandoning its local allies. His propaganda stresses that the west has no stomach for conflict, a lesson he claims he learned from Beirut.  <P>In Spain last Sunday, many voters simply wanted to opt out of the conflict with al-Qaida. If it were merely a matter of opposition to the Iraq war, the earlier polls would have reflected something closer to the Socialists' numbers on election day. Doubtless, these voters believed that by leaving Iraq, they would now be left alone. As one Socialist voter put it: \"We won't be a target for al-Qaida anymore; they'll attack England, the third ally.\"  <P>This willingness to sacrifice the fate of allies, to say nothing of the fate of the Iraqi and Afghan peoples, is understandable, especially after such trauma. The pity is that such a step won't buy them safety. Getting on your knees doesn't make you a more appealing society to the men who run terrorist organisations; it makes you a less difficult target. When Spain is struck again - by Eta or someone else - it will learn this truth again, as perhaps every generation has to.  <P>It is only a matter of time, one fears, until the mass atrocities of which September 11 was the first become an exemplar for non-fundamentalist groups who wish to turn the riches, technology and freedom of the west against its citizens in order to destroy the system of representative government and civil peace we share. Quite telling was the disclosure of an al-Qaida document that outlined the use of bombing to influence the Spanish elections and expressed the hope that the other partners of the US-led coalition would follow if Spain were to withdraw from Iraq.  <P>Bombing has become a means to a geopolitical, international end of the terrorists' choosing. Asymmetrical warfare, as this is called, is a function of our power just as much as of our vulnerability. Its increasing availability is one flaw, among others, in the arguments of those who assert that if we had only left Iraq, or Afghanistan, or Bosnia, alone, we would be safe.  <P><B>&#183;</B> Philip Bobbitt is a former director for intelligence programmes at the US National Security Council and author of the forthcoming book The War Against Terror"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/20/iraq.iraq","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2004/mar/20/iraq.iraq","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"David Aaronovitch: Dignity and defiance","webPublicationDate":"2004-03-14T01:37:21Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2004/mar/14/britainand911.terrorism1","fields":{"body":"The killers may be have nothing but contempt for us, but the great rituals of democracy can be more wonderful than one thinks possible. No one on Friday, in that whole great crowd, brandished nooses, or set upon those who sounded like Basques or looked like Arabs. Instead eight million people stood together in rain-soaked Madrid, in Salamanca, in Santiago, everywhere, in dignity and re-committed themselves to democracy, solidarity and liberty. <P>How shall we imagine those others, though? Sitting around a kitchen table in a suburban apartment perhaps, with glasses of apple juice or tea, pieces of paper scattered about, covered in diagrams and sketch maps. How many devices? Thirteen should do it, packed with nails, because that really increases their effectiveness. Where placed? All on suburban trains timed to get into the central station in the same period. If it goes to plan we should be able to kill or maim possibly hundreds of commuters. Which will be a great victory. Good luck! God bless!  <P>This is a picture of a minor Wannsee that must have happened in some form, a conference of technicians planning the deliberate deaths of innocents. Where the whole point was the deliberate deaths of innocents. Other such events may have been planned and aborted, but nothing has happened in Europe on this scale since Lockerbie. To illustrate what this means, the following was posted by someone in Madrid on a British website on Friday:  <P>'A woman who survived the blast has lost her husband, her two sons, and her grandsons. The radio reported this morning that she was so overwhelmed with the loss that she later tried to kill herself. In one of the destroyed trains they rescued a seven-month-old baby. They haven't been able to find his parents and he has just died while in the ICU.'  <P>By one of those pieces of bad timing that journalists dread, the Madrid bombings coincided with the publication in the Spectator magazine (edited by the Conservative MP, Boris Johnson) of an article by the newly knighted former editor of the Times, Simon Jenkins. This was an argument ridiculing the Prime Minister for his recent Sedgefield speech on terror, and accompanied by the headline, 'Nothing to fear but fear itself'.  <P>Mr Blair, argued Jenkins, was really just a second-class intellect, 'roaming the world in search of dragons'. But actually there weren't any. That stuff with the tanks at Heathrow and the smallpox terror alert, had all been staged in order to 'prepare the country for George Bush's invasion of Iraq'. But such a threat of terrorists capable of killing masses of people was a chimera. 'The technology of terror,' claimed Jenkins, 'has in reality advanced little beyond the   1970s and 1980s.' True, '...inept Western diplomacy in the Middle East may increase the risk of bombings, but the risk is qualitatively no different from that of paranoid fanatics and anarchists down the ages. Read Conrad.'  <P>I'll deal with the 'we brought it upon ourselves' bit later. For the moment Jenkins's point is that terrorism is no threat to our societies unless we allow it to be. It is not, in that sense, like a war between states that one could lose. OK. We could discuss that proposition with relation to Northern Ireland. The killings there at the height of The Troubles were, year by year, probably comparable with road-death statistics. And they were emotionally and politically intolerable.  <P>Yet, on the whole, the objective of Irish terrorists was not the mass killing of civilians. After 11 died and 63 were wounded in the 1987 Enniskillen bomb, the IRA apologised for a mission that had 'gone wrong'. There is some evidence that the carnage was a psychological turning-point for people such as Martin McGuiness. Now, however, we are dealing with groups who actively want to kill as many civilians as they possibly can. That's a big difference, Simon. It changes nearly everything.  <P>In April 1999, David Copeland, the Nazi bomber, planted three devices in London, the last of which blew up in the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho, killing three. Another four victims suffered amputations. The result was a period of extreme anxiety. Now imagine that 13 such bombs had been planted to explode simultaneously, and that these had been put there by a Muslim group. What effect would that have? Or if a shoulder launched ground-to-air missile brought down a large passenger plane over a suburb of Hounslow. Why not? The technology exists, and the attempt has been made in Kenya. What we thought was missing before 11 September was the will to use it. We were wrong. Read Conrad? Why? I've seen the video.  <P>At a moment like this all kinds of hares are set running. On BBC's  Question Time on Thursday, one audience member linked possible terrorism to the entry of Eastern European workers when their countries accede to the EU. And as that one scurried around, Shirley Williams unhutched several more on Radio's Any Questions a day later. Terrorists, she said, were, 'young men. Desperate. Unemployed.' This in the same week as we saw the Hamas tapes of the tubby, well-employed, un-desperate boys from Britain who bombed Mike's Bar in Tel Aviv. These were young men animated by cultish belief and a desire for personal victory in a kind of apocalyptic  Fame Academy.  <P>Nor has it much to do with world poverty, or inequality. We have not been bombed by the Congolese, the Chinese, or the peoples of the Maghreb. And efforts at debt relief or humanitarian intervention in Sierra Leone have not earned us much credit with the people who - long before Iraq - set the Bali bomb.  <P>We should also forget this guff about one man's terrorist being another man's freedom fighter, and the notion that accommodating terrorism can help placate it. The IRA's unnecessary and immoral campaign came to an eventual end precisely because, after 25 years, it had not succeeded. Peaceful civil rights agitation would have achieved as much change inside a decade, and with no one dead.  <P>This leads into the relativism argument. One letter writer to the  Guardian said this week, before Madrid: 'Let's probe the words \"terror\" and \"good and evil\". Who has vast armament factories, and who does not?...The category of \"who has\", of almighty power, seems always to belong to the \"good\". The \"evil\", those who use \"terror\", seem always to be in the category of \"who does not\".'  <P>Yes, and let's keep it that way. Let's make sure that those who do not have, the Madrid bombers, the Karbala bombers, the Copelands, don't get. And this brings us back to Jenkins's point about 'inept diplomacy'. He means Iraq, Israel and Afghanistan circa 2001. But he could just as well have mentioned Afghanistan 1990, Saudi Arabia just about any time, Iraq in 1988, and all the times when diplomacy was aimed at maintaining relations with corrupt governments and walked away from democrats. It was in an age that Jenkins liked; the age that gave rise to all this.  <P>Shirley Williams claimed that part of the problem in dealing with terrorism was the fact that President Bush had called it a 'war'. Far better, she said, had we called it, 'a campaign against crime'. One nearly weeps, but even so, there is something hiding there beneath the confusion. It is that undermining terror is as important, strategically, as confronting it. Its supports should be knocked away, or bribed, or persuaded, or loved out of its flirtation with death.

If the answer is yes, you should welcome the announcement that the government is expected to make today that the commercial planting of a genetically modified (GM) crop in Britain can go ahead. If the answer is no, you should regret it. The principal promotional effort of the genetic engineering industry is to distract us from this question. </p><p>GM technology permits companies to ensure that everything we eat is owned by them. They can patent the seeds and the processes that give rise to them. They can make sure that crops can't be grown without their patented chemicals. They can prevent seeds from reproducing themselves. By buying up competing seed companies and closing them down, they can capture the food market, the biggest and most diverse market of all.  </p><p>No one in her right mind would welcome this, so the corporations must persuade us to focus on something else. At first they talked of enhancing consumer choice, but when the carrot failed, they switched to the stick. Now we are told that unless we support the deployment of GM crops in Britain, our science base will collapse. And that, by refusing to eat GM products in Europe, we are threatening the developing world with starvation. Both arguments are, shall we say, imaginative; but in public relations, cogency counts for little. All that matters is that you spin the discussion out for long enough to achieve the necessary result. And that means recruiting eminent figures to make the case on your behalf.  </p><p>Last October, 114 scientists, many of whom receive funding from the biotech industry, sent an open letter to the prime minister claiming that Britain's lack of enthusiasm for GM crops \"will inhibit our ability to contribute to scientific knowledge internationally\". Scientists specialising in this field, they claimed, were being forced to leave the country to find work elsewhere.  </p><p>Now forgive me if you've heard this before, but it seems to need repeating. GM crops are not science. They are technological products of science. To claim, as Tony Blair and several senior scientists have done, that those who oppose GM are \"anti-science\" is like claiming that those who oppose chemical weapons are anti-chemistry. Scientists are under no greater obligation to defend GM food than they are to defend the manufacture of Barbie dolls.  </p><p>This is not to say that the signatories were wrong to claim that some researchers who have specialised in the development of engineered crops are now leaving Britain to find work elsewhere. As the public has rejected their products, the biotech companies have begun withdrawing from this country, and they are taking their funding with them. But if scientists attach their livelihoods to the market, they can expect their livelihoods to be affected by market forces. The people who wrote to Blair seem to want it both ways: commercial funding, insulated from commercial decisions.  </p><p>In truth, the biotech companies' contribution to research in Britain has been small. Far more money has come from the government. Its Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, for example, funds 26 projects on GM crops and just one on organic farming. If scientists want a source of funding that's unlikely to be jeopardised by public concern, they should lobby for this ratio to be reversed.  </p><p>But the plight of the men in white coats isn't much of a tearjerker. A far more effective form of emotional blackmail is the one deployed in the Guardian last week by Lord Taverne, the founder of the Prima PR consultancy. \"The strongest argument in favour of developing GM crops,\" he wrote, \"is the contribution they can make to reducing world poverty, hunger and disease.\"  </p><p>There's little doubt that some GM crops produce higher yields than some conventional crops, or that they can be modified to contain more nutrients, though both these developments have been overhyped. Two projects have been cited everywhere: a sweet potato being engineered in Kenya to resist viruses, and vitamin A-enhanced rice. The first scheme has just collapsed. Despite $6m of funding from Monsanto, the World Bank and the US government, and endless hype in the press, it turns out to have produced no improvement in virus resistance, and a decrease in yield. Just over the border in Uganda, a far cheaper conventional breeding programme has almost doubled sweet potato yields. The other project, never more than a concept, now turns out not to work even in theory - malnourished people appear not to be able to absorb vitamin A in this form. However, none of this stops Lord Taverne, or George Bush, or the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, from citing them as miracle cures for global hunger.  </p><p> But some trials of this kind are succeeding, improving both yield and nutritional content. Despite the best efforts of the industry's boosters to confuse the two ideas, however, this does not equate to feeding the world.  </p><p>The world has a surplus of food, but still people go hungry. They go hungry because they cannot afford to buy it. They cannot afford to buy it because the sources of wealth and the means of production have been captured and in some cases monopolised by landowners and corporations. The purpose of the biotech industry is to capture and monopolise the sources of wealth and the means of production.  </p><p>Now in some places governments or unselfish private researchers are producing GM crops that are free from patents and not dependent on the application of proprietary pesticides, and   these could well be of benefit to small farmers in the developing world. But Taverne and the other propagandists are seeking to persuade us to approve a corporate model of GM development in the rich world, in the hope that this will somehow encourage the opposite model to develop in the poor world.  </p><p>Indeed, it is hard to see what on earth the production of crops for local people in poor nations has to do with consumer preferences in Britain. Like the scientists who wrote to the prime minister, the emotional blackmailers want to have it both ways: these crops are being grown to feed starving people, but the starving people won't be able to eat them unless er ... they can export this food to Britain.  </p><p>And here we encounter the perpetually neglected truth about GM crops. The great majority are not being grown to feed local people. In fact, they are not being grown to feed people at all, but to feed livestock, whose meat, milk and eggs are then sold to the world's richer consumers. The GM maize the government is expected to approve today is no exception. If in the next 30 years there is a global food crisis, it will be because the arable land that should be producing food for humans is instead producing feed for animals.  </p><p>The biotech companies are not interested in whether science is flourishing or whether people are starving. They simply want to make money. The best way to make money is to control the market. But before you can control the market, you must first convince the people that there's something else at stake.  </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/mar/09/gm.comment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/science/2004/mar/09/gm.comment","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"'Indonesia Jones' theory for Africa","webPublicationDate":"2004-01-12T02:48:22Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2004/jan/12/indonesia.rorycarroll","fields":{"body":"They were Africa's Vikings.

When we finish I think historians will appreciate that this voyage would have been possible.\"  <P>It is generally agreed that approximately 1,500 years ago sailors from Indonesia and Malaysia, famed navigators who roved the Pacific, also sailed 3,700 miles west and settled Madagascar, a vast island off Mozambique.  <P>It might be expected that they also explored the African mainland, just 150 miles further away, but unlike Madagascar there is little evidence: people on the continent do not resemble or talk like Indonesians.  <P>Historians have noted fragments of Asian influence across Africa - plants, craftwork, instruments - but largely rejected the notion that it came via fleets of Indonesian double-outrigger canoes.  <P>Inspired by a 1959 seminar at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, Mr Dick-Read, 73, has spent decades travelling the continent bolting those fragments into a radical theory of \"Africa's vikings\" which he hopes to publish this year.  <P>Indonesian spices such as cassia and cinnamon which ancient Rome imported came not via India but east Africa after an epic sea voyage, he says, which would also explain how early iron age pottery spread so quickly in the first and second century AD down the coast from Kenya all the way to South Africa.  <P>Plants such as banana, plantain and yam are widely believed to have originated in Indonesia and Mr Dick-Read cites oral and written accounts of rituals related to the food which suggest they reached west Africa too early for overland travellers.  <P>Mr Dick-Read says pottery and bronze sculptures found in Nigeria also came from seafarers since they were too far from Saharan trade routes and too sophisticated for indigenous artwork of that time.  <P>Sir Mervyn Brown, Britain's former ambassador to Madagascar and a historian of the region, found Mr Dick-Read's conclusions \"generally plausible\" and urged fresh research.  <P>\"Dick-Read has not provided any great new revelations in this area but has produced more detailed supporting evidence,\" he said. \"The influence in west Africa is not generally known, even among academics.\"  <P>Other historians disagree.

Then, in 1925, the first evidence of an early fossil link between the apes and man was published by Raymond Dart and Africa was proposed as the cradle of humanity. This bold claim was largely dismissed at the time. But with further finds, especially in the eastern part of the continent, Africa has since remained at the centre of the search for human origins.</em></p><p>In 1924, the fossilised skull of a child, half-ape, half-human, found its way without warning into the hands of a young anatomist in Johannesburg, South Africa. He was in an excellent position to interpret it and, in the subsequent paper in Nature, to challenge the accepted concepts of the time. This man was Raymond Dart.  </p><p>In 1923, Dart and his wife Dora had travelled from Britain to South Africa, where Dart was to take up a new post. He was 30 years old and not enamoured of the prospect. He later recalled: \"I hated the idea of uprooting myself from what was then the world's centre of medicine &#91;University College London&#93; ... to take over the anatomy department at Johannesburg's new and ill-equipped University of the Witwatersrand. I felt I had lived a pioneer's life for quite long enough in my younger days.\"  </p><p>But what was to happen there the following year was surely beyond his wildest dreams. Dart wished to establish an anatomical museum in his new department, and his attention was drawn to fossilised baboon skulls that were being unearthed in a lime mine at Taung in the northern Cape.  </p><p>In Adventures with the Missing Link, Dart later described how two boxes of fossils from Taung were delivered to his house one Saturday afternoon in 1924, just as he was dressing for a wedding reception to be held there. Unable to contain his curiosity, he wrenched open the boxes in the driveway. The first did not seem to contain anything of interest. But when he looked into the second, as he later recalled: \"A thrill of excitement shot through me. On the very top of the rock heap was what was undoubtedly an endocranial cast or mold of the interior of the skull. Had it been only the fossilised brain cast of any species of ape it would have ranked as a great discovery, for such a thing had never before been reported. But I knew at a glance that what lay in my hands was no ordinary anthropoidal brain. Here in lime-consolidated sand was the replica of a brain three times as large as that of a baboon and considerably bigger than that of an adult chimpanzee. The startling image of the convolutions and furrows of the brain and the blood vessels of the skull were plainly visible.  </p><p>\"It was not big enough for primitive man, but even for an ape it was a big bulging brain and, most important, the forebrain was so big and had grown so far backward that it completely covered the hindbrain. But   was there anywhere among this pile of rocks, a face to fit the brain? I ransacked feverishly through the boxes. My search was rewarded, for I found a large stone with a depression into which the cast fitted perfectly ... I stood in the shade holding the brain as greedily as any miser hugs his gold, my mind racing ahead. Here I was certain was one of the most significant finds ever made in the history of anthropology.  </p><p>\"Darwin's largely discredited theory that man's early progenitors probably lived in Africa came back to me. Was I to be the instrument by which his 'missing link' was found?  </p><p>\"These pleasant daydreams were interrupted by the bridegroom himself tugging at my sleeve. 'My God, Ray,' he said, striving to keep the nervous urgency out of his voice. 'You've got to finish dressing immediately - or I'll have to find another best man. The bridal car should be here any moment.'  </p><p>\"Reluctantly, I replaced the rocks in the boxes, but I carried the endocranial cast and the stone from which it had come along with me and locked them away in my wardrobe.\"  </p><p>For the next three months Dart used every spare moment to patiently chip away the matrix from the skull, using his wife's sharpened knitting needles. Then, two days before Christmas, the rock parted and the face of a child emerged, with a full set of milk teeth and its permanent molars in the process of erupting. Dart wrote: \"I doubt if there was any parent prouder of his offspring than I was of my Taungs baby on that Christmas of 1924.\"  </p><p>Dart wasted no time in preparing his report for submission to Nature. In essence, it pointed out that while the skull, teeth and jaw of this child had been \"humanoid\", rather than anthropoid or ape-like, this was undoubtedly a small-brained hominid, or member of the human family - the first of its kind to be described. He pointed out that the forward position of the foramen magnum, where the spinal cord attached to the skull, clearly indicated that this hominid had walked upright, with its hands free for the manipulation of tools and weapons in an open environment far to the south of the equatorial forests inhabited by chimpanzees and gorillas.  </p><p>Finally, Dart asserted that Australopithecus africanus, the southern ape of Africa as he called it, provided clear evidence that Africa had been the cradle of mankind.  </p><p>Although Charles Darwin had predicted that human ancestors must have lived in Africa, subsequent finds of large-brained fossil humans in Europe had swung scientific opinion in favour of Eurasia as the birthplace of humanity. These included numerous Neanderthal remains, those of the modern-looking Cro-Magnon man from the Dordogne region of France, discovered in 1868, and the Piltdown skull from southern England in 1912, whose large brain and ape-like jaw fulfilled the expectations of the time - until it was shown to be a hoax. In fact,   Piltdown had seemed far more acceptable than had Pithecanthropus (now Homo) erectus, a fossil hominid with a relatively small brain but upright stature, whose remains were found in 1893 by Eugene Dubois in the river gravels of Java after a five-year search.  </p><p>The reception this discovery received was so disappointing that Dubois locked the remains away for 25 years in a Dutch museum before they became available for others to study. So it is not surprising that Dart's child from Taung, presented as the missing link from Africa, met with a chilly reception in Europe. The authorities dismissed it as, at best, a relative of the chimpanzee or gorilla with little relevance to human ancestry, stressing that until an adult specimen was available, the matter was hardly worth discussing.  </p><p>This attitude prevailed even though Dart took the specimen to Britain in 1931 and exhibited it at scientific gatherings. At this time, the Taung child had a strange experience: by mistake, Dora Dart left it in the back of a London taxi. After a prolonged tour of the city, the box was opened by the   taxi driver who, alarmed at seeing a skull inside, took it straight to a police station. Here a distraught Dora was reunited with the child.  </p><p>Although Dart's claims endured severe criticism overseas, in South Africa they enjoyed the unwavering support of Robert Broom, a palaeontologist known for his work on the evolution of mammals from reptiles. In his later years, while he was based at the Transvaal museum in Pretoria, Broom started a deliberate search for an adult fossil of Australopithecus. His attention was drawn by several of Dart's students to the Sterkfontein caves near Krugersdorp, where lime mining had unearthed fossil baboon skulls as at Taung.  </p><p>In August 1936, on his second visit to Sterkfontein, Broom was handed the endocranial cast of an adult ape-man by the quarry manager and in the next   few days he found much of the rest of the skull. One month later his report on Australopithecus transvaalensis, as he named the new find, appeared in Nature and the Illustrated London News. The initial discovery was followed by many others during the next few years, leaving no doubt as to the hominid status of this African ape-man.  </p><p>Not content with this, in 1938 Broom described a second kind of hominid from the nearby cave of Kromdraai as Paranthropus robustus, with a wide flat face and extremely large molar teeth. Subsequent work has shown that this \"robust\" ape-man lineage arose from an africanus-like stock about 2.5m years ago and then coexisted with early humans until about 1m years ago, when it became extinct.  </p><p>With fossils of adult ape-men now available for study, Dart's concept of Australopithecus as an African ancestor of later humans was generally accepted. Heartened and relieved, Dart re-entered the emotional field of hominid palaeontology and started a long-term investigation of the Makapansgat Limeworks cave, 250km north-east of Johannesburg. Here miners had blasted out a vast accumulation of fossil bones, and among them Dart identified and described several new Australopithecus specimens. Most of the other fossils came from antelope   and Dart speculated as to how all of these bones had found their way to the cave. In a long series of publications he argued that the ape-men had been mighty hunters that underwent a \"predatory transition from ape to man\", bringing back to their cave those bones from their kills that could serve as useful tools and weapons. Using dramatic and provocative prose, Dart presented his view of \"the blood-bespattered archives of humanity\" and provoked further research on the ways that bones accumulate in African caves.  </p><p> E ast Africa came into the palaeontological spotlight in 1959, when Mary Leakey found a very complete robust ape-man skull at Olduvai gorge, Tanzania; this has been followed by numerous other finds in Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and elsewhere. Many of these fossils come from lake-bed sediments, which can be dated from the volcanic ash beds laid down with them. It appears now that more than 4m years ago, small upright-walking hominids such as Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus anamensis were living in the forest-edge habitats of north-east Africa; in time they were   succeeded by small Australopithecus afarensis individuals, known now by many fossils including the skeleton of \"Lucy\", immortalised by Don Johanson. These appear to have been theancestors of Dart's Australopithecus africanus, which could have given rise to both our own and the robust ape-man lineages.  </p><p>Today, palaeoanthropology is a rapidly evolving field. New discoveries and interpretations confirm Africa's place as an evolutionary centre. Attention has lately shifted to Chad, in the central part of the continent, with the announcement of the discovery of a 6-7m-year-old hominid skull there.

It uses WorldSpace satellite radio to relay villagers' information that they have sent to a central office via email and post.\r\n \r\nThe summit - which was attended by 12,000 business and civic leaders, government officials and more than 40 head of state - also rejected a proposal from the Senegalese president, Abdoulaye Wade, to create a voluntary digital solidarity fund to help governments, companies and non-profit organisations narrow the so-called digital divide. </p><p>\"It's in order to purchase equipment from developed countries, equipment to log on to the Internet,\" Mr Wade told the conference, adding that western companies would benefit from being able to sell more goods. </p><p>But western leaders insisted that existing funding mechanisms are adequate, essentially deferring serious discussion on the matter until the next information society summit in Tunisia in 2005. </p><p>Work on the digital divide was overshadowed by contentious issues such as how best to preserve freedom of expression and whether an independent UN agency should take over internet governance from the agency spawned by the US commerce department.\r\n \r\nSome financial support was announced, however. </p><p>A US aid agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, pledged $400m (£229m) in loans and loan guarantees for US companies that invest overseas in yet-to-be-determined digital divide projects. </p><p>A UN task force also launched an e-schools initiative to coordinate and connect existing but disparate efforts to connect schools to the global communication network - one of the summit's 2015 goals. </p><p>But little money has been committed to the project so far, and although the European Union has said it may be ready to contribute additional funds, it hasn't gone as far as to put a figure on any possible donation.</p><p>The EU information commissioner, Erkki Liikanen, said too much attention had been paid to funding projects. He said regulatory reforms - eliminating government monopolies and encouraging open markets, for one - would do much more to encourage private investments. </p><p>The World Bank's vice president for infrastructure, Nemat Shafik, echoed that sentiment and said the summit was useful in getting the issue on national agendas. </p><p>But Sean O'Siochru, a spokesman for the London-based group Communication Rights in the Information Society, said the lack of funding and other specifics is an ominous sign. </p><p>\"There are some fine words, but not a whole lot in it,\" he said. \"It's one thing to sign on, but it's another for anything to happen in a region or a country.\" </p><p>Andy Carvin, a digital divide expert at the Benton Foundation in Washington DC, would also like to see more specific goals and strategies from world leaders. </p><p>\"It's interesting in a cynical way to see how governments have come to agree to pass the buck on a variety of these issues, including the digital solidarity fund,\" he said. </p><p>The secretary general of the International Telecommunication Union, Yoshio Utsumi, said many of the details - including financing - will be addressed at the Tunisia summit.

From 7 to 11 they can hear Top 40 chart hits, local news and views, announcements, requests and dedications. They can even take part in competitions to win a T-shirt or a funny hat. In the evening they can unwind with a similar format. </p><p>All this comes out of a shipping container in the base at Umm Qasar, converted to an air conditioned studio housing the latest radio technology and manned by two broadcasters and an engineer. It is the latest example of the British Forces Broadcasting Services' determination to be on the ground alongside the troops.  </p><p>BFBS, which this week celebrates its 60th anniversary, broadcasts programmes to the Gulf around the clock. Most of them will come from the headquarters at Gerrards Cross but a minimum of six hours a day will be specially created for them in Iraq. Indeed it was one of BFBS's proudest boasts last year that they were up and running there within 10 days of soldiers entering the country. And just a few weeks ago a transmitter was set up in Baghdad to reach the British military personnel now based at the coalition headquarters.  </p><p>\"The focus is on morale,\" says Alan Phillips, managing editor of BFBS UK. \"The idea is to give them an entertaining, informative, fun start to their day. We're not gung ho but we're not doomy and gloomy either. And forces' humour is an interesting thing. They know there's a time to be solemn and remember your friends but they also know there's a time to just crack on with the job. When we were in Kuwait during the build up to the war the number one request was The Boys Are Back In Town.\"  </p><p>When David Crwys-Williams was a young pilot officer in Kenya in the early 60s his then-girlfriend had Younger Than Springtime from the hit show of the day South Pacific played for him on the forces' radio along with her message of undying love. He heard it in a packed mess in Nairobi on a Sunday lunchtime surrounded by his mates and it was possibly, he says, the most embarrassing moment of his life.  </p><p>Despite that mortification, the BFBS remained the backdrop to his career from those early days right through to his role of Commander-in-Chief in the Falklands in 1988/89 and the rank of Air Vice-Marshal. \"It played a great part in my life as it does in most servicemen and women's lives. If you're in a strange country miles from anywhere and very possibly lonely, it's a strong link with home. You're particularly aware of it in times of separation and conflict.\"  </p><p>Today Crwys-Williams is the chief executive and managing director of its parent organisation,   the Services Sound and Vision Corporation, and this Thursday he will host a party at the Banqueting House in Whitehall to celebrate the anniversary. From its humble beginnings in wartime Algiers BFBS has grown to a multi-million-pound organisation broadcasting round-the-clock news, music and information to all three Armed Services in 23 countries.  </p><p>Crwys-Williams took the job ten years ago when he retired from the RAF. Like all his colleagues he must be a civilian: although funded by the Ministry of Defence, BFBS remains independent of it. This is in contrast to the Americans whose forces' broadcasts are the work of the military and thus an arm of the Pentagon. \"We have total editorial control,\" he says, \"and I know of no incident in 60 years when that control has been taken off us. What other country would do that?\"  </p><p>The studios in countries such as Iraq are containers - converted to house broadcasting equipment, computers and air conditioning - which can be taken in on the back of a lorry. Though the satellite link technology is state-of-the-art the fuel supply is often more basic - in Kosovo they ran on a generator fuelled by 50 gallons of diesel a day.  </p><p>This local dimension is a key factor. Although much of the general programming is produced at the headquarters in Buckinghamshire, it is then relayed to stations around the world where DJs and presenters can add in local material: news, views, coverage of social and sporting activities and issues such as pay and conditions, announcements and useful, sometimes vital, information. In Iraq today that may be a reminder to boil drinking water; during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus it was evacuation guidance for both military families and tourists. It also allows broadcasters to modify a programme's tone in the light of losses in combat or other disasters.  </p><p>The set-up makes for a close relationship between broadcaster and audience. As defence and features editor Rory Higgins says: \"The immediacy is what's amazing.You do your show, go out of your Portakabin studio and into the mess for breakfast and the chef will start shouting out what he thinks. That's pretty direct feedback. You get quite involved with people's lives. I remember one squaddie in the Falklands whose marriage was in trouble desperately trying to ply me with drinks so I'd play his requests and make his dedications sound sincere.\"  </p><p>Higgins's other postings have included Cyprus, Hong Kong, the Balkans and most recently Iraq where he was embedded with the Second Royal Tank regiment. \"Obviously your reports have to be factually correct but I think your interpretations of situations might be better because you have this military background. After one report a soldier came up to me and said 'you were pretty critical of the military there'. I said 'well, that's the way I saw it' and he said 'good on you.' They don't want propaganda.\"  </p><p>BFBS broadcasts three networks - Radio 1, Radio 2 and Gurkha Radio for Gurka servicemen and their families. One is a pop and information channel aimed at the younger end; Two is a mix of music, talk, news and sport and includes some BBC Radio 4 and 5 Live programmes: officers are apparently particularly keen on The Archers. With overseas military personnel totalling around 140,000 worldwide the potential audience is the size of a small city. It is also an audience whose characteristics are well-known to the programme makers: Radio 1 knows, for instance, that its listeners are mostly fit, fully employed young men whose favourite programme is the UK Top 40 which goes out every Monday evening at 7pm local time whether in Canada, seven hours behind GMT, or Brunei, eight hours ahead.  </p><p>Right from its beginnings in World War II when millions of Germans tuned in, forces' radio has always been listened to by \"eavesdroppers\" - young people often learn English from it - which makes for special considerations in areas which might have, for example, strict views about alcohol or social mores. It is even possible to turn transmission up and down according to local sensibilities: Kuwait is kept low, for instance, to avoid reaching too much of Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>During its 60 years BFBS has helped launch the careers of many radio names, among them Raymond Baxter, Gloria Hunniford, Sarah Kennedy and David Hamilton. It remains synonymous with Two Way Family Favourites, a joint venture with the BBC. It drew, at its peak, 20 million listeners and the romance between presenters Cliff Michelmore and Jean Metcalfe made them the nation's sweethearts.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/dec/01/mondaymediasection.themilitary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/2003/dec/01/mondaymediasection.themilitary","sectionName":"UK news"},{"webTitle":"Hope for Aids cure as prostitutes defy virus in the slums","webPublicationDate":"2003-11-23T01:31:05Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2003/nov/23/kenya.aids","fields":{"body":"Little children playing naked in pools of viscous water; rows upon rows of rusty tin shacks, implausibly teeming with human life; a man in the crowd wearing an Arsenal shirt. <P>These are some of the images that catch the eye as you drive through the labyrinthine alleyways of Majengo, Nairobi's giant slum. But it is the shoes that linger. Thousands upon thousands of shoes, piles of them for sale on rickety market stalls - on every corner, more piles.  <P>It is a puzzling spectacle. A nurse riding with me in a minibus packed with medical workers offered a compelling interpretation. They are dead people's shoes. 'People who have died of Aids.'  <P>People compare the Aids disaster in Africa with the fourteenth-century plague in Europe, but here is an image recalling a more recent horror, the shoe mountains which Allied soldiers found in the Nazi extermination camps. Except that the African holocaust continues, under our noses, at a searing pace; except it is impossible to claim ignorance of what is going on.  <P>The statistics have been recited so often they deaden the mind. But, at a time when the resources of the rich countries of the world are focused on what are, in numerical terms, the relatively innocuous consequences of terrorism, one should force oneself to pay attention. To reflect on the fact that 7,000 die of Aids each day in Africa, that 17 million have died since the disease first appeared two decades ago, that more than 30 million Africans are living with HIV/Aids, most without access to the anti-retroviral drugs that have contained the disease in the United States and Western Europe.  <P>Here in Kenya, in a continent synonymous with catastrophe, there is some good news on what ought to be the great cause of our time, a cure for Aids. Barely six months ago Kenya emerged from 40 years of corrupt single-party rule to initiate a new era of democracy. The US and Britain's chief concern here is that al-Qaeda operatives may be hiding out on Kenyan soil. For Kenyans, the big issue is an enemy that has orphaned 1,250,000 of its children.  <P>Majengo is the main battleground and a woman called Agatha is on the front line. Her life is sordid beyond imagination. A prostitute who works out of one of Majengo's tin shacks, smaller than a double bed, she makes an unlikely medical heroine. Agatha is 52 and a grandmother, but still has sex - when she is lucky, she says - with 40 clients a day. What makes her even more remarkable is that, in tests systematically conducted over two decades, she has never tested positive for HIV.  <P>She is one of a group of 50 prostitutes from Majengo who have demonstrated a miraculous resistance to an illness that has decimated their clients and killed off 95 per cent of the female competition. Studied by researchers from the University of Nairobi and the University of Oxford, they were all found to have an inordinate quantity of white blood cells perfectly honed to kill HIV-infected cells. The information obtained from the women has been converted in laboratories at Nairobi University's Faculty of Medicine into a trial vaccine. The first tests on humans began this year. No other project in the world is more advanced or offers more hope that the holy grail, a lasting solution to Aids, may be found.  <P>Africa, always the problem, could turn out to be a large part of the solution. It is symbolic of Kenya's new determination to achieve political health that Africans are doing it for themselves. In the ground-breaking research they are providing not just the 50 miracle women but also the scientific expertise.  <P>'We are at the cutting edge,' said Dr Omu Anzala, project manager of the Kenyan Aids Vaccine Initiative (KAVI). 'Earlier trials in the US looked at the possibility of finding a vaccine using antibodies, but that has not worked. We're pursuing the cellular route, which is the way to go. We are in the world vanguard.'  <P>This is no idle boast. KAVI, in collaboration with the researchers at Oxford, receives funding from the world's leading non-governmental organisation in the field, the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), to which Bill Gates has contributed mightily. 'When we first contacted IAVI in 1998 they were sceptical,' said Anzala, 'arguing that vaccine trials of this kind had not been done before in Africa. I said, \"Yes, but give us a chance.\" And they did.'  <P>The Americans have put up the money for an impressively modern research unit, labs equipped with the latest technology in Nairobi University's otherwise Spartan medical faculty.  <P>With a PhD from Canada and a post-doctorate degree from Oxford, Anzala has the confidence of a man who has overcome great obstacles to get where he has. Brought up in a family of 13, his mother died of asthma when he was 19. Appalled that she died of an illness so innocuous, he decided that his country needed more and better doctors.  <P>A muscular 40-year-old who combines the lithe movement of an athlete with a slightly abstracted air, Anzala is a man on whom the hopes of many millions rest.  <P>'My family tried to persuade me to stay in Canada or the UK, because they told me I would have made a lot more money there,' he says. 'And this is true. There is no private pharmaceutial company involved with us here. We and Oxford and IAVI have the patent on the vaccine, but it is a deal based on the idea of no financial gain.  <P>'Private companies are not interested in this - they would rather be making Viagra or something. Well, for me, this has more value than anything else.'  <P>There is an important principle at play here. Africa's other great sickness, apart from Aids, is its dependency on the developed nations. 'Look at food aid,' Anzala says. 'It has become institutionalised. People I know in Europe who came here 25 years ago say they are amazed to see the same people still receiving handouts. Lots of good intentions, but we become accustomed to it and the outcome is people all over Africa just sit! Waiting for the next handout.  <P>'Everybody is always saying that what we need to resolve the Aids issue is anti-retroviral drugs to be made available,' he said. 'They all cry, \"ARVs! ARVs!\" The rich countries should provide it free, or at cut-down prices. They have a point, of course. But what we don't want is for Aids prevention to follow the pattern of food aid. Free drugs, free help: great. But what happens on the day when, for whatever reason, help dries up?'  <P>Anzala considers it essential Africans are involved in developing a vaccine, and to be pioneering a new culture of research thrills him. 'There is nothing else quite like this on the continent. This is different and new. We are doing it by ourselves. This vaccine may or may not work out. If it does, we will probably have to wait another six or seven years to be certain. This is what research is all about. Painstaking, often frustrating. But even if it does not work, we will have begun a scientific tradition that we see spreading to young students coming through. We will have the know-how and confidence to explore other diseases crippling us.'  <P>Anzala began work in Majengo with the prostitutes in 1987. Today, reversing the historical pattern, doctors from all over the world come to Nairobi to learn from his work. 'We do have an amazing accumulation of data, unmatched in the world,' he says. 'The likes of Agatha have been monitored scrupulously for years.'   <P>The monitoring takes place at Majengo Clinic, a small, dusty, red-brick construction that in another setting would be entirely anonymous. But, after driving through the slum's almost impenetrable clutter of people, shacks and shoes, the little red house seems as majestic as the Taj Mahal. Agatha is not everyone's idea of a prostitute either. Not just because she is a grandmother, with five children of her own. Her entire demeanour suggests something else altogether. The sort of woman in whose care you would unhesitatingly leave your small children. Chubby-faced, she wraps her ample figure from top to toe in a green and yellow African cloth of rough cotton.  <P>She charges clients 35 pence and works by day, never at night. 'I have two girls at school. I don't want them to know that I am using our home as my office. They have no idea what I do for a living, and I want to keep it that way. I don't want them to end up as I have.' She shakes her head and a tear forms in one eye.  <P>Agatha is a simple woman with no formal education. Far from hardened by three decades of prostitution, she smiles at some of the questions with embarrassment. How does she keep going at her age? It is not easy, she confesses, looking at the floor. 'I feel these terrible pains in my chest. I am too old. I cannot bear the weight of these men on top of me any more.  <P>'Still some do not want to use condoms. Some refuse, and that is scary, especially as those tend to be already positive and don't care, or maybe want to infect you.' She allows regular clients not to use a condom. 'But if it is a new client and he wants to eat the sweet without a wrapper, I say no. If I have not had a client all day and I am broke I might end up agreeing.'  <P>One man who never uses a condom is her mdosi - her main man. 'Everyone needs an mdosi to help pay the bills,' she said. Her previous mdosi died of cholera in prison. When asked if there is any love in her relationship with her new  mdosi, she squints up to see whether the question is a joke. When she sees it is not, she breaks out into the one and only laugh of an interview lasting an hour.  <P>Agatha's resistance to Aids is something she herself does not quite believe as she sees other prostitutes succumbing to the familiar agonising death - going blind, then deaf, then wasting away after losing the ability to eat. 'When the condom breaks, as it often does, I am filled with fear.'  <P>Farah, another of the resistant prostitutes and a 42-year-old Muslim, places her faith less in science: 'The father of my last two children died of Aids. I did not use condoms with him. God alone knows why I am resistant. It could be because my life has been so hard that God grants me this favour.  <P>'There is a big difference since 1985, when I began. Now people are scared of HIV and the economy is worse.' How does she advertise? 'I sit on a stool outside my house. But not like the whores in the city who are almost naked. Decently dressed.'  <P>She has five childen and two grandchildren and, like Agatha, her shack has no electricity or running water. But she has her dignity and refuses to let her suffering defeat her. 'I want God to give me a long life and to help us be the instrument to find a vaccine for HIV. That would make me so happy.'  <P>Agatha feels the same. She turns up conscientiously at the clinic for the required tests. 'My life has been terrible, I know it,' she says. 'But I am happy to participate in this research, if it contributes to find a cure for Aids.  <P>'I hate my job but it would make me happy to know I have helped other people, even if I do not know who they are.'"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/23/kenya.aids","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2003/nov/23/kenya.aids","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Non-fiction: Nov 8","webPublicationDate":"2003-11-08T01:05:48Z","sectionId":"books","id":"books/2003/nov/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview25","fields":{"body":"<p>Making Jazz French, by Jeffrey H Jackson (Duke, &#163;16.95)  </p><p>This historical tale of cultural globalisation examines the reception and adaptation of jazz music in France in the 1920s and 30s. As American musicians settled in Montmartre after the first world war, some Parisian critics bewailed the incipient death of the French chanson in the face of the \"hectic\" new sound that incorporated \"the xylophone, the klaxon and the coconuts\", and Parisian musicians worried that they would be driven out of their jobs. Others, however, were energised by \"la musique n&#232;gre\", as personified by Josephine Baker, while also reminding themselves triumphantly that the saxophone was invented by a Belgian who lived in France. Jackson's interesting, if somewhat dry, work traces how a new \"cabaret culture\" replaced big dancehalls, examines the effect recording technology had on the spread of jazz, and shows how, by the end of the 30s, the indefatigable French had managed to incorporate jazz into a new idea of a national cultural tradition.  </p><p><strong> SP</strong>    </p><p><strong> Tortoise, by Peter Young (Reaktion, &#163;12.95)</strong>   </p><p>Tortoises: slow-moving, wrinkly, grumpy-faced shell-dwellers that grow to be extremely old.

This book relates the cultural and scientific histories of the beast, from Achilles failing to outrun a tortoise in Zeno's paradox, and Roman soldiers imitating its shell as a defensive formation, to the tortoise that supports the world in Chinese mythology (and I thought that was only in Terry Pratchett's books), and the animal's reputation for phlegmatic wisdom or even magical healing powers. \"In the 1960s a two-foot-long tortoise at a European hospital in Kenya was credited with curing back pain. Patients sat on the back of 'The Doctor', and within seconds lumbago and other backaches vanished.\" We also learn about tortoise conservation and are given tips on how to take care of them as pets.

His aim is to analyse the various psychopathologies that go into creating the boss from hell. It is largely a panoramic survey of business and psychological literature, with many amusing labels for types of incompetence. Perhaps your superior is \"derailed\", or a \"smallshot\", or practises \"homeopathic management\"? It is not always clear how much faith Furnham places in all the models he describes, especially when it comes to a diagram of the four humours or when he deflatingly quotes a satire on personality questionnaires: \"When I get to my place of work: a) I ring directory enquiries to find out where they have moved; b) I take care to wash my hands several times.\" But his recommendations for assessing \"competencies\" and improving management through specific training seem sensible enough.</p><p><strong> SP</strong>    </p><p><strong> Friedrich Nietzsche: A Biography, by Curtis Cate (Pimlico, &#163;14.99)</strong>   </p><p>It may be wondered whether we need yet another biography of Nietzsche, several of which have arrived, clumped like buses, within the last 18 months. The strength of this one is in the sensuous storytelling details - a resin-scented room, long walks through forests - and in Cate's refusal to attempt to systematise Nietzsche's thought. However, though his prose is amiable and sympathetic, one may balk at his shorthand summations of philosophy, such as a hasty description of Schopenhauer as a mere pessimist, and an offhand reference to that philosopher's \"almost pathological hatred of his mother\". Fortunately unrepresentative of the book is a bizarre preface in which Cate uses Nietzsche as a hammer with which to beat the present, which he excoriates for its fashion sense and for \"its aggressively crude 'rap' singing\". I rather think Nietzsche would have liked Eminem. </p><p><strong> SP</strong>    </p><p><strong> Beyond the Oxus, by Monica Whitlock (John Murray, &#163;8.99)</strong>   </p><p>This is the recent history of central Asia - often unknown to those who live there or were driven thence - as researched by Whitlock, BBC World Service correspondent in Tashkent. Russian annexation, Soviet-isation with starvation, the deliberate destruction of rooted cultures, displaced by enforced migrations: it's a story terrible in enormous overview (up to the 2001 US arrival in the region, as imperial as anything that preceded it) and painful in the tiny details collected by Whitlock from those who remembered the cotton plantations, the founding of that Nowheresville called Dushanbe and the USSR's retreat from Afghanistan. She also tenderly records the immediate realities of bitter places - snow driving through the destroyed wall of a Tashkent house to melt on the faded roses of its wallpaper, or Tajik mountain villagers surviving on their mono-crops, apples or apricots, as war made roads impassable and markets impossible.  </p><p><strong> VR</strong>    </p><p><strong> Cinema Eden, by Juan Goytisolo (Sickle Moon, &#163;9.99)</strong>   </p><p>I was irritated at first by the gaudiness of these essays about the Muslim Mediterranean - the descriptions of Cicek Pasaji in Istanbul and the great plaza of Marrakech are more crowded and insistent than the places themselves, Goytisolo's adverbs and adjectives jostling and bustling the reader. But the subjects are fascinating - the cheap movie houses that screen Bollywood films for all-male audiences, the pilgrimages to the shrines of popular Islamic \"saints\" in Morocco (Goytisolo, born to the old Spain of  ferias  and bullfights, understands well the desire to venerate). And sometimes his perceptions are calm and original, as when he contrasts Egyptian TV soap operas, shot in quiet, private and large spaces, empty but for fancy furniture, with the real life of Cairo, especially its City of the Dead, which teems with people pressed together in promiscuous existence. He's terrific on weddings, funerals and, especially, the olive-oiled leather pants of Turkish wrestlers. </p><p> VR</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview25","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2003/nov/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview25","sectionName":"Books"},{"webTitle":"The persuaders","webPublicationDate":"2003-10-18T23:22:22Z","sectionId":"theobserver","id":"theobserver/2003/oct/19/features.magazine27","fields":{"body":"<p>Rawalpindi, Pakistan: on what may or may not have been a Saturday, on what may have been 1 March, in a house in this city that may have been this squat two-storey white one belonging to Ahmad Abdul Qadoos, with big, grey-headed crows barking in the front yard, the notorious  terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was roughly awakened by a raiding party of  Pakistani and American commandos.

Others have suggested that a more apt designation might be al-Qaeda's 'chief franchisee'.</p><p>Whatever the analogy, he is one of the organisation's most important figures, a burly, distinctly modern, cosmopolitan  37-year-old man fanatically devoted to a medieval form of Islam. He was born to Pakistani parents, raised in Kuwait and educated in North Carolina to be an engineer, before he returned to the Middle East to build a career of bloody mayhem.</p><p>Some say that Sheikh Mohammed was captured months before the 1 March date announced by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Abdul Qadoos, a pale, white-bearded alderman in this well-heeled neighbourhood, told me that Sheikh Mohammed was not there 'then or ever'. The official video of the snatch appears to have been faked. But the details are of minor importance. Whenever, wherever and however it happened, nearly everyone now agrees that Sheikh Mohammed is in US custody, and has been for some time. In the first hours of his captivity the hood came off and a picture was taken. It shows a bleary-eyed, heavy, hairy, swarthy man with a full black moustache, thick eyebrows, a dark outline of beard on a rounded, shaved face, three chins, long sideburns and a full head of dense, long, wildly moussed black hair. He stands before a pale, tan, chipped wall, leaning slightly forward, like a man with his hands bound behind him, the low cut of his loose-fitting white T-shirt exposing matted curls of hair on his chest, shoulders and back. He is looking down and to the right of the camera. He appears dazed and glum.</p><p>Sheikh Mohammed is a smart man. There is an anxious, searching quality to his expression in that first post-arrest photo. It is the look of a man awakened into nightmare. Everything that has given his life meaning - his role as husband and father, his leadership, his stature, plans and ambitions - is finished. His future is months, maybe years, of imprisonment and interrogation, a military tribunal and almost certain execution. You can practically see the wheels turning in his head, processing his terminal predicament. How will he spend his last months and years? Will he maintain a defiant silence? Or will he succumb to his enemy and betray his friends, his cause and his faith?</p><p>If Sheikh Mohammed felt despair in those first hours, it didn't show. According to a Pakistani officer who sat in on an  initial ISI interview, the al-Qaeda sub-boss seemed calm and stoic. For his first two days in custody he said nothing beyond confirming his name. A CIA official says that Sheikh Mohammed spent those days 'sitting in a trance-like state and reciting verses from the Koran'. On the third day he  is said to have loosened up. Fluent in the local languages of Urdu, Pashto and Baluchi, he tried to shame his Pakistani interrogators, lecturing them on their responsibilities as Muslims and upbraiding them for co-operating with infidels.</p><p>'Playing an American surrogate won't help you or your country,' he said. 'There are dozens of people like me who will give their lives, but won't let the Americans live in peace anywhere in the world.' Asked if Osama bin Laden was alive, he said, 'Of course he is alive.' He spoke of meeting with bin Laden in 'a mountainous border region' in December. He seemed smug about US and British preparations for war against Saddam Hussein. 'Let the Iraq war begin,' he said. 'The US forces will be targeted inside their bases in the Gulf. I don't have any specific information, but my sixth sense is telling me that you will get the news from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait.' Indeed, in the following months, al-Qaeda carried out a murderous attack  in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>On that third day, hooded once more, Sheikh Mohammed was driven to Chaklala Air Force base in Rawalpindi and turned over to US forces. From there he was flown to the CIA interrogation centre in Bagram, Afghanistan, and from there, some days later, to an 'undisclosed location' (a place the CIA calls 'Hotel California') - presumably a facility in another co-operative nation, or perhaps a specially designed prison aboard an aircraft carrier.</p><p>It doesn't much matter where, because the place would not have been familiar or identifiable to him. Place and time, the anchors of sanity, were about to come unmoored. He might as well have been entering a new dimension, a strange new world where his every word, move and sensation would be monitored and measured; where things might be as they seemed, but might not; where there would be no such thing as day or night, or normal patterns of eating and drinking, waking and sleeping; where hot and cold, wet and dry, clean and dirty, truth and lies, would all be tangled and distorted.</p><p>Intelligence and military officials would talk about Sheikh Mohammed's state only indirectly, and conditionally. But by the time he arrived at a more permanent  facility he would already have been dog tired, hungry, sore, uncomfortable and afraid - if not for himself, then for his wife and children, who had been arrested either with him or some months before, depending on which story you believe. He would have been warned that lack of co-operation might mean being turned over to the more direct and brutal interrogators of some third nation. He would most likely have been locked naked in a cell with no trace of daylight. The space would be filled night and day with harsh light and noise, and would be so small that he would be unable to stand upright, to sit comfortably, or to recline fully. He would be kept awake, cold and probably wet. If he managed to doze, he would be roughly awakened. He would be fed infrequently and irregularly, and then only with thin, tasteless meals. Sometimes days would go by between periods of questioning, sometimes only hours or minutes. The human mind craves routine, and can adjust to almost anything in the presence of it, so his jailers would take care that no semblance of routine developed.</p><p>Questioning would be intense - sometimes loud and rough, sometimes quiet and friendly, with no apparent reason for either. He would be questioned sometimes by one person, sometimes by two or three. The session might last for days, with interrogators taking turns, or it might last only a few minutes. He would be asked the same questions again and again, and then suddenly be presented with something completely unexpected - a detail or a secret that he would be shocked to find they knew. He would be offered the opportunity to earn freedom or better treatment for his wife and children. Whenever he was helpful and the information he gave proved true, his harsh conditions would ease. If the information proved false, his treatment would worsen. On occasion he might be given a drug to elevate his mood prior to interrogation; marijuana, heroin and Sodium Pentothal have been shown to overcome a reluctance to speak, and methamphetamine can unleash a torrent of talk in the stubbornest subjects, the very urgency of the chatter making a complex lie impossible to sustain. These drugs could be administered surreptitiously with food or drink, and, given the bleakness of his existence, they might even offer a brief period of relief and pleasure, thereby  creating a whole new category of longing - and new leverage for his interrogators.</p><p>Deprived of any outside information, Sheikh Mohammed would grow more and more vulnerable to manipulation. For instance, intelligence gleaned after successful al-Qaeda attacks in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia might be fed to him, in bits and pieces, so as to suggest foiled operations. During questioning he would be startled regularly by details about his secret organisation - details would be drawn from ongoing intelligence operations, new arrests, or the interrogation  of other captive al-Qaeda members. Some of the information fed to him would be true, some of it false. Key associates might be said to be co-operating, or to have completely recanted their allegiance to jihad. As time went by, Sheikh Mohammed's knowledge would decay, while that of his questioners improved. He might come to see once-vital plans as insignificant, or already known. The importance of certain secrets would gradually erode.</p><p>Isolated, confused, weary, hungry, frightened and tormented, Sheikh Mo-hammed would gradually be reduced to  a seething collection of simple needs, all  of them controlled by his interrogators. The key to filling all those needs would  be the same: to talk.</p><p>These days, we hear a lot about America's overpowering military technology; about the professionalism of its warriors; about the sophistication of its weaponry, eavesdropping and telemetry, but right now the most vital weapon in its arsenal may well be the art of interrogation. To counter an enemy who relies on stealth and surprise, the most valuable tool is information, and often the only source of that information is the enemy himself. Men, like Sheikh Mohammed, who have been taken alive in this war, are classic candidates for the most cunning practices of this dark art. Intellectual, sophisticated, deeply religious and well trained, they present a perfect  challenge for the interrogator. Getting at the information they possess could allow us to thwart major attacks, unravel their organisation, and save thousands of lives. They and their situation pose one of the strongest arguments in modern times for the use of torture.</p><p>Torture is repulsive. It is deliberate  cruelty, a crude and ancient tool of political oppression. It is commonly used to  terrorise people, or to wring confessions out of suspected criminals who may or may not be guilty. It is the classic short cut for a lazy or incompetent investigator. Horrifying examples of torturers' handiwork are catalogued and publicised annually by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other organisations that battle such abuses worldwide. One cannot help sympathising with the innocent, powerless victims showcased in their literature.</p><p>But professional terrorists pose a harder  question. They are locked boxes containing potentially life-saving information. Sheikh Mohammed has his own political and religious reasons for plotting mass murder, and there are those who would applaud his principled defiance in captivity. But we pay for his silence in blood.</p><p>The word 'torture' comes from the Latin verb torquere, 'to twist'. Webster's New World Dictionary offers the following primary definition: 'The inflicting of severe pain to force information and confession, get revenge, etc'. Note the 'severe', which summons up images of the rack, thumbscrews, gouges, branding irons, burning pits, impaling devices, electric shock and all the other devilish tools devised by human beings to mutilate and inflict pain on others.</p><p>All manner of innovative cruelty is still commonplace, particularly in Central and South America, Africa and the Middle East. Saddam Hussein's police force burnt various marks into the foreheads of thieves and deserters, and routinely sliced tongues out of those whose words offended the state. In Sri Lanka, prisoners are hung upside down and burnt with hot irons. In China they are beaten with clubs and shocked with cattle prods. In India, the police stick pins through the fingernails and fingers of prisoners. Maiming and physical abuse are legal in Somalia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Sudan and other countries that practise sharia law; the hands of thieves are lopped off, and women convicted of adultery may be stoned to death. Governments around the world continue to employ rape and mutilation, and to harm family members, including children, in order to extort confessions or information. Civilised people everywhere readily condemn these offences.</p><p>Then there are methods that, some people argue, fall short of torture. Called 'torture lite', these include sleep deprivation, exposure to heat or cold, the use of drugs to cause confusion, rough treatment (slapping, shoving or shaking), forcing a prisoner to stand for days at a time or to sit in uncomfortable positions, and playing on his fears for himself and his family. Although excruciating for the victim, these tactics generally leave no permanent marks and do no lasting physical harm.</p><p>The Geneva Convention makes no distinction: it bans any mistreatment of prisoners. But some nations that are otherwise committed to ending brutality have employed torture lite under what they feel are justifiable circumstances. In 1987, Israel attempted to codify a distinction between torture, which was banned, and 'moderate physical pressure', which was permitted in special cases. Indeed, some police officers, soldiers and intelligence agents who abhor 'severe' methods believe that banning all forms of physical pressure would be dangerously naive. Few support the use of physical pressure to extract confessions, especially because victims will often say anything (to the point of falsely incriminating themselves) to put an end to pain. But many veteran interrogators believe that the use of such methods to extract information is justified if it could save lives - whether by forcing an enemy soldier to reveal his army's battlefield positions or forcing terrorists to betray the details of ongoing plots. As these interrogators see it, the wellbeing of the captive must be weighed against the lives that might be saved by forcing him to talk. A method that produces life-saving information without doing lasting harm to anyone is not just preferable, it appears to be morally sound. (Hereafter, I will use 'torture' to mean the more severe, traditional outrages and 'coercion' to refer to torture lite, or moderate physical pressure.)</p><p>There is no clear count of suspected terrorists now in US custody. About 680 were detained at Camp X-Ray, the specially constructed prison at Guantanamo, on the southeastern tip of Cuba. Most of these are now considered mere foot soldiers in the Islamist movement, swept up in Afghanistan during the swift rout of the Taliban. They come from 42 nations. Scores of other detainees, considered leaders, have been or are being held at various locations around the world: in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, Syria, Jordan, Morocco, Yemen, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and Iraq, where US forces now hold the top echelon of Saddam Hussein's dismembered regime. Some detainees are in disclosed prisons, such as the facility at Bagram and a camp on the island of Diego Garcia. Others - upper-tier figures such as Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Zubaydah, Abd al-Rashim al-Nashiri, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Tawfiq bin Attash - are being held at undisclosed locations.</p><p>It is likely that some captured terrorists' names and arrests have not yet been revealed; people may be held for months before their arrests are staged. Once a top-level suspect is publicly known to be in custody, his intelligence value falls. His organisation scatters, altering its plans, disguises, cover stories, codes, tactics and communication methods. The maximum opportunity for intelligence gathering comes in the first hours after an arrest, before others in a group can possibly know that their walls have been breached. Keeping an arrest quiet for days or weeks prolongs this opportunity. If 1 March was in fact the day of Sheikh Mohammed's capture, then the cameras and the headlines were an important intelligence failure. The arrest of the senior al-Qaeda figure Abu Anas Liby, in Sudan in February 2002, was not made public until a month later, when US efforts to transfer him to custody in Egypt were leaked to a newspaper. So, again, there is no exact count of suspected terrorists in custody. In September last year, testifying before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, Cofer Black, the US State Department's co-ordinator for counterterrorism, said that the number who have been detained was about 3,000.</p><p>Is the US torturing these prisoners? Three inmates have died in US custody in Afghanistan, and reportedly 18 prisoners at Guantanamo have attempted suicide; one prisoner there survived after hanging himself, but remains unconscious and is not expected to revive. Shah Muhammad, a 20-year-old Pakistani who was held at Camp X-Ray for 18 months, told me that he repeatedly tried to kill himself.  'They were driving me crazy,' he said.</p><p>Public comments by administration officials have fuelled further suspicion. An unnamed intelligence official told The Wall Street Journal: 'What's needed is a little bit of smacky-face. Some al-Qaeda just need some extra encouragement.'</p><p>Describing the clandestine war, Black said, 'This is a highly classified area.</p><p>All I want to say is that there was \"before 9/11\" and \"after 9/11\". After 9/11 the gloves came off.' He was referring to the overall counterterrorism effort, but in the context of detained captives the line was suggestive. A story in December 2002 by Washington Post reporters Dana Priest and Barton Gellman described the use of 'stress and duress' techniques at Bagram, and an article in The New York Times in March described the maltreatment of prisoners there. That month, Irene Kahn, the secretary-general of Amnesty International, wrote a letter of protest to President Bush:</p><p>'The treatment alleged falls clearly within the category of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which is absolutely prohibited under international law... &#91;We&#93; urge the US government to instigate a full, impartial inquiry into the treatment of detainees at the Bagram base and to make the findings public. We further urge the government to make a clear public statement that torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of suspects in its custody will not be tolerated under any circumstances, and that anyone found to have engaged in abuses will be brought to justice.'</p><p>In June, at the urging of Amnesty and other groups, President Bush reaffirmed America's opposition to torture, saying,  'I call on all governments to join with the United States and the community of law-abiding nations in prohibiting, investigating and prosecuting all acts of torture... and we are leading this fight by example.'</p><p>A slightly more detailed response had been prepared two months earlier by the Pentagon's top lawyer, William J Haynes II, in a letter to Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch. Haynes wrote: 'The United States questions enemy combatants to elicit information they may possess that could help the coalition win the war and forestall further terrorist attacks upon the citizens of the United States and other countries. As President Bush reaffirmed recently to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, United States policy condemns and prohibits torture. When questioning enemy combatants, US personnel are required to follow this policy and applicable laws prohibiting torture.'</p><p>Haynes's choice of words was careful - and telling. The human rights groups and the administration are defining terms  differently. Yet few would argue that getting Sheikh Mohammed to talk doesn't serve the larger interests of mankind.</p><p>If there is an archetype of the modern interrogator, it is Michael Koubi. The former chief interrogator for Israel's General Security Services, or Shabak, Koubi probably has more experience than anyone else in the world in the interrogation of hostile Arab prisoners, some of them confirmed terrorists and religious fanatics - men, he says, 'whose hatred of the Jews is unbridgeable'. Koubi has blue eyes in a lean, crooked face. His nose has been broken twice and now ends well to the right of where it begins, giving him a look that is literally  off-centre. His wisdom, too, is slightly off-centre, because Koubi has a uniquely twisted perspective on human nature. For decades he has been experimenting with captive human beings, cajoling, tricking, hurting, threatening and spying on them, steadily upping the pressure, looking for cracks at the seams.</p><p>I met Koubi at his home on the beach in Ashkelon, just a short drive north of the border with the Gaza Strip, in whose prisons he worked for much of his career. He is comfortably retired from his Shabak job now, a grandfather three times over, and works for the municipal Inspection and Sanitation Department.</p><p>There are still many things he is not free to discuss, but he is happy to talk about his methods. He is very proud of his skills, among them an ability to speak Arabic so fluently that he can adopt a multitude of colloquial flavours. Koubi came to his career as an interrogator through his love of language. He grew up speaking Hebrew, Yiddish and Arabic, and he studied Arabic in high school, working to master its idiom and slang. He also had a knack for reading the body language and facial expressions of his subjects, and for sensing a lie. He is a skilled actor who could alternately befriend or intimidate a subject. Blending these skills with the tricks he had learnt over the years for manipulating people, Koubi didn't just question his subjects, he orchestrated their emotional surrender.</p><p>To many, including many in Israel, Koubi and the unit he headed are an outrage. The games they played and the tactics they employed are seen as inhumane, illegal and downright evil. It is hard to picture this pleasant grandfather as the leader of a unit that critics accuse of being brutal, but then, charm has always been as important to interrogation work as toughness or  cruelty - perhaps more important. Koubi says that only in rare instances did he  use force to extract information from his  subjects; in most cases it wasn't necessary.</p><p>'People change when they get to prison,' Koubi says. 'They may be heroes outside, but inside they change. The conditions  are different. People are afraid of the unknown. They are afraid of being tortured, of being held for a long time. Try to see what it is like to sit with a hood over your head for four hours, when you are hungry and tired and afraid, when you  are isolated from everything and have no clue what is going on.' When the captive believes that anything could happen - torture, execution, indefinite imprisonment, even the persecution of his loved ones -  the interrogator can go to work. Under  pressure, he says, nearly everyone looks out first and foremost for number one.</p><p>Every large part of who a man is depends on his  circumstances. No matter who he is before his arrest, his sense of self will blur in custody. Isolation, fear and deprivation force a man to retreat,  to reorient himself and to reorder his  priorities. For most men, Koubi says, the hierarchy of loyalty under stress is 1) self, 2) group, 3) family, 4) friends. In other words, even the most dedicated terrorist (with very rare exceptions), when pushed hard enough, will act to preserve and  protect himself at the expense of anyone or anything else. 'There's an old Arab saying,' Koubi says. '\"Let one hundred mothers  cry, but not my mother - but better my mother than me\".'</p><p>With older men the priorities shift slightly. In middle age the family often overtakes the group (the cause) to become the second most important loyalty. Young men tend to be fiercely committed and ambitious, but older men - even men with deeply held convictions, men admired and emulated by their followers - tend to have loves and obligations that count for more. Age frays idealism, slackens zeal and cools ferocity. Abstractions lose ground to wife, children and grandchildren. 'Notice that the leaders of Hamas do not send their own sons, daughters and grandchildren to blow themselves up,' Koubi says.</p><p>So it is often the top-level men, like Sheikh Mohammed, who are easier to crack. Koubi believes that having the  al-Qaeda leader's wife and children in  custody gives his interrogators powerful leverage. The key is to find a man's weak point and exploit it. For Koubi, the three critical ingredients of that process are preparation, investigation and theatre.</p><p>Preparing a subject for interrogation means softening him up. Ideally, he has been pulled from his sleep - like Sheikh Mohammed - early in the morning, roughly handled, bound, hooded (a coarse, dirty, smelly sack serves the purpose  perfectly), and kept waiting in discomfort, perhaps naked in a cold, wet room, forced to stand or to sit in an uncomfortable position. He may be kept awake for days prior to questioning, isolated and ill-fed. He may be unsure where he is, what time of day it is, how long he has been or will be held. If   he is wounded, as Abu Zubaydah was, pain medication may be withheld; it is  one thing to cause pain, another to refuse  to relieve it.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/oct/19/features.magazine27","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2003/oct/19/features.magazine27","sectionName":"From the Observer"},{"webTitle":"US to fit airliners with anti-missile defences","webPublicationDate":"2003-09-19T01:34:15Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2003/sep/19/theairlineindustry.internationalnews","fields":{"body":"<p>American airliners may be fitted with systems to combat terrorist-fired missiles under a plan to which the White House has committed $100m (&#163;62.5m) in research funds. </p><p>The department of homeland security, which was established after September 11, is making \"aggressive\" efforts to adapt systems used by the armed forces, according to a document sent to defence contractors.  </p><p>Many US air force planes are equipped with jamming technologies and flares intended to disrupt the trajectories of shoulder-launched missiles such as the two launched at an Israeli airliner leaving Mombasa airport in Kenya last year.  </p><p>That incident, which some blame on terrorists linked to al-Qaida, lent fresh urgency to the issue, administration sources told the New York Times.

In the UK, of course, all eyes were on the <B>Hutton inquiry</B>. Tricky to summarise, but here goes: emails showed that the <B>BBC had doubts</B> about Andrew Gilligan's reporting, and Newsnight's <B>Susan Watts hit out at her bosses</B> for trying to use her reports to corroborate his - but her taped conversation with David Kelly seemed to do just that. Special advisers, senior civil servants and intelligence chiefs <B>juggled responsibility</B> for hardening the language of the government's dossier, and for pushing Kelly into the public eye; <B>Alastair Campbell denied all charges</B> of sexing-up; top spymaster John Scarlett insisted he had been in charge; <B>Geoff Hoon blamed Downing Street</B>, and - in front of an audience including members of the public who had camped out overnight - <B>the prime minister claimed he would have resigned</B> if the Today programme's reporting had been true. Meanwhile,<B> No 10 spokesman Tom Kelly apologised</B> for calling the dead scientist a Walter Mitty fantasist. Just as August was about to end, however, <B>Alastair Campbell resigned</B>; the announcement had been predicted, but the timing - months earlier than expected - stunned Westminster and Fleet Street.    <P><B>Science and technology</B><BR> <P><B>The power went off in New York</B>, and across 9,300 square miles of the eastern seaboard of the US and Canada, prompting fears of terrorism, transport chaos, a carnival atmosphere - and increased sales of torches. Canada blamed the US; New York mayor Michael Bloomberg blamed Canada; industry chiefs picked on Ohio, saying faults there may have snowballed across the network. Just like <B>flash mobs</B> - the pointless gatherings organised via email that debuted in Britain - the trend crossed the Atlantic swiftly: another power cut meant <B>huge swathes of south and east London were plunged into darkness,</B> stranding commuters on non-functioning trains above and below ground. There weren't any New York-style street parties - but then it was raining. Science provided some breakthroughs - such as <B>the first cloned horse</B>, which could transform racing, if the sport's authorities can be convinced - but mainly it was a month of technological defeats: <B>an epidemic of computer viruses</B>, for example, deluging inboxes with dross, and the <B>announcement of the closure, by 2010, of the Thorp reprocessing plant</B> at Sellafield, signalling the end of the dream of endless electricity. Oh, and the<B> nightmarish deregulation of directory inquiries</B>, offering a baffling host of new numbers for which mobile phone users must pay up to 10 times more.    <P><B>Incidents taking place at unusually high speeds </B><BR> <P><B>A Kittitian won the 100m at the World Athletic Championships</B>. In fact, though, Kim Collins - one of the 36,000 people living on the tiny Caribbean island of St Kitts - achieved first place with the slowest time ever to win: 10.07 seconds. Significantly faster was Mike Newman, who won <B>the world speed record for a car driven by a blind person</B>, reaching 144.7mph in an adapted Jaguar. Newman, blind since he was eight, plans a motorbike circuit next - with the added thrill of going round bends. And an audacious <B>hit-and-run involving an electric wheelchair</B> remained unsolved in Wythenshawe, after pedestrians failed to stop an elderly man who knocked a two-year-old to the ground. In a gripping detail, a burned-out electric wheelchair was found soon afterwards, abandoned near the Red Rose pub.    <P><B>Heat</B><BR> <P>It was, officially, far too hot. <B>The highest temperatures ever recorded in Britain</B> hit a high of 38.1C in Gravesend, in Kent. And so, predictably, Britain removed more clothes than was strictly decent and set off for the beach, only to find that, because of the potential buckling effect of the heat on rails, <B>the rail network was in even more chaos than usual</B>, with widespread 60mph speed restrictions. Network Rail's decision to <B>close much of the network over the bank holiday weekend</B> for much-needed repairs caused further problems for those still attempting to use the trains. In France, the heatwave meant <B>the Beaujolais harvest was a month early</B>, with growers predicting a tiny yield - because so much juice has evaporated - but an exceptionally high-quality one. The heat in Britain, meanwhile, meant <B>bookies lost their shirts</B> - owing huge payouts to people who had bet on the temperature reaching 99F. Still, they can take comfort from the government's draft of the new <B>gambling bill</B>, which envisions \"supercasinos\" dominating a newly deregulated industry.    <P><B>Astronomy</B><BR> <P>Like a semi-comatose drunk person on a late-night bus, <B>the planet Mars has invaded Earth's personal space</B>, coming closer than at any time in human history - though admittedly it is still about 34.6m miles away. And in a vast cosmological parallel to New York and London during the power cuts, <B>the lights are going off in the universe itself</B>, astronomers announced: there aren't enough bright new stars to replace dying ones. Things have been getting dimmer for a while - though neither we nor our planet will be around when darkness finally falls.    <P><B>Religion</B><BR> <P>Conservative Anglicans worldwide continued to make a <B>monumental fuss about gay bishops</B> - but where an attempted appointment in Britain failed, it succeeded in the US, where the Episcopalians confirmed Gene Robinson as bishop of New Hampshire after what looked like a last-minute smear campaign; the Archbishop of Canterbury announced a world summit on gay priests this autumn. Religious activists were on the march in Alabama, too, arguing that a <B>granite monument of the Ten Commandments at the state's main courtroom</B> was perfectly compatible with the idea of separation if church and state (they lost). And Mel Gibson, perhaps tired of being criticised for making inoffensive films, made a <B>really offensive film, The Passion</B> - angering some Jewish leaders who felt it perpetuated the claim that the Jews were responsible for the death of Christ.    <P><B>Royalty</B><BR> <P>A few more episodes in the soap opera that is Britain's royal family: <B>an investigation into the gatecrashing of Prince William's 21st birthday</B> revealed a sequence of errors, including many ignored alarms. The fancy dress theme \"could have made identification of guests difficult\", Commander Frank Armstrong noted, by way of explanation. Prince Harry, meanwhile, himself gatecrashed centuries of Aboriginal culture, incorporating <B>ancient Australian symbolism into his A-level artwork</B> and infuriating Aboriginal artists who accused him of stealing their heritage. His brother William, receiving hunting lessons from a Masai warrior in Kenya, reportedly <B>killed a small deer with a spear</B>, eliciting criticism from animal rights activists, among them the pop star Pink. Still, the family still had enough fans to make <B>the first public opening of Clarence House, the Queen Mother's former home</B> a sell-out. A British <B>inquest into the death of Princess Diana</B> will reportedly take place next year, more than six years after she died; legal tangles and police investigations have been responsible for the delay.    <P><B>Sport</B><BR> <P>In tennis, <B>Pete Sampras retired</B>, while a small tennis club in the south of France became the focus of a poisoning scandal; the father of a young star is accused of poisoning her rivals. In football, Chelsea, under new ownership, went on a spending spree while <B>David Beckham scored his first competitive goal for Real Madrid</B>: \"It's nice to be accepted and welcomed as well as I have been,\" he said. The <B>BBC won back the rights to Match of the Day</B>. And despite gaining the advantage on several occasions, <B>England's cricketers threw away the fourth Test at Headingley</B> to South Africa.    <P><B>Crime</B><BR> <P>An unseen <B>sniper</B>, perhaps re-enacting the terror that enveloped Washington last year, killed at least three people in West Virginia. The American basketball star Kobe Bryant made his first court appearance on charges of raping a 19-year-old woman; the US media has descended on the proceedings. A former energy trader at Wall Street giant Merrill Lynch was accused of <B>embezzling $43m</B> from the firm. And the 15-year-old girl known only as Witness Bromley said <B>testifying at the Damilola Taylor murder trial had ruined her life</B>. \"I have to stay in all the time, can't go to school, can't get education,\" she told the BBC, adding: \"Today, for instance, I'll go and drink some cider and get drunk, like I normally do.\"    <P><B>Celebrity </B><BR> <P><B>Pop Idol</B> returned, surging ahead of Fame Academy in the ratings. A few rungs up the ladder of highbrow, lit celeb <B>Martin Amis made the Booker Prize longlist</B>, despite his latest novel Yellow Dog coming in for a slew of criticism - fellow author Tibor Fischer described it as \"not-knowing-where-to-look bad\".

His mystical regard for tradition was a product both of his childhood in still-medieval Abyssinia and an intense pride in his aristocratic forebears, the Barons of Chelmsford.  </p><p>Born in Addis Ababa, where his father was British minister, he grew up in the barbaric splendour of an imperial court, and was privileged to see a victorious and blooded Abyssinian army marching through the city in the full panoply of war. It was an experience he never forgot.  </p><p>Daydreams of Africa and the wider world were his means of escape throughout his awkward and often unhappy schooldays at St Aubyn's school, Rottingdean, in Sussex (1919-23), Eton College (1923-28), and his time reading history at Magdalen College, Oxford (1929-33). During his first summer vacation from the university, he set off alone, working his passage on a tramp steamer to Istanbul and returning third-class by train.  </p><p>So began the travels that he recorded in fine prose and black-and-white photography. On his return, he found both a personal invitation to attend the coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie of Abyssinia, and a note from the Foreign Office appointing him honorary attach&#233; to the Duke of Gloucester for the event - where he met Evelyn Waugh, a writer of very different sympathies.  </p><p>For his second vacation, he set himself another endurance test, a month with a Hull fishing trawler off Iceland. Here he learnt to withstand the need for sleep.  </p><p>But Africa was his goal, and at the age of only 23 he went to explore Abyssinia's Awash River and the forbidding Aussa sultanate with its Danakil nomads, chiefly noted for a disturbing tendency to kill men and carry off their testicles as trophies. Such practices held little horror for Thesiger, who had survived fagging and flogging at Eton, and saw at least one young Afar man, flushed from the exertion of slaughtering and mutilating four victims in a day, as \"the equivalent of a nice, rather self-conscious Etonian who had just won his school colours for cricket\".  </p><p>Thesiger gained his own blue, for boxing at Oxford - when he captained the university team in 1933, a victory against Cambridge was marred by the breaking of his noble nose - and like many an athletically endowed young Oxbridge graduate of the 30s, he sought a career in the country where \"blues\" were said to rule \"blacks\": the Sudan. As an assistant district commissioner in the Sudan political service from 1935 onwards, he served in arid Darfur, and later in the steaming swamps of the Sudd, where one of his chief jobs was shooting troublesome lions that attacked local herds.  </p><p>It was in Darfur that he first learned to travel by fast-riding camel with local companions, dressing as they did, eating local food out of the same bowl, and asking nothing of technology but a good rifle, a torch and a compass. During one leave he completed a long and dangerous journey to the almost unknown Tibesti mountains in the Sahara, and fell in love with the desert: \"I was exhilarated by the sense of space, the silence, and the crisp cleanness of the sand. I felt in harmony with the past, travelling as men had travelled for untold generations across the deserts, dependent for their survival on the endurance of their camels and their own inherited skills.\"  </p><p>During the war he was a  bimbashi -  the most junior officer rank - in the Sudan defence force. He won the DSO in 1941 for leadership under fire in fighting the Italians, under the idiosyncratic Orde Wingate in the liberation of Abyssinia. With a masterstroke of bluff, he subsequently forced the surrender of an Italian-held fort, taking 2,500 prisoners. He later fought as a major, as second in command of a Druze legion formed to fight the Vichy French in Syria - which enabled him to visit a deserted Petra. He also served with Colonel David Stirling's Special Air Service (SAS) in north Africa. Following the defeat of the Afrika Korps in 1943, the SAS went to Palestine, and in October of that year Thesiger left the organisation to act as an adviser to Haile Selassie in Abyssinia.  </p><p>A resulting chance meeting brought him a job in what became the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation's anti-locust unit and the opportunity to make his most famous journeys in the deserts of Arabia under its aegis, between 1945 and 1949. Arabia's legendary Empty Quarter had been the goal of all Arabian explorers from Richard Burton onward, and although Thesiger was not the first to cross it, he was the first to explore it thoroughly, mapping the oasis of Liwa and the quicksands of Umm As-Sammim. He crossed the desert twice with Bedu companions, and his trek across the western sands from the Hadhramaut to Abu Dhabi was the last and greatest expedition of Arabian travel.  </p><p>During his journeys he was caught up in inter-tribal raids, pursued by hostile raiders, and arrested by the Saudi authorities. He travelled alone in the Hejaz, the Assir and Najran, and explored the Trucial Coast and Dhofar in southern Arabia. He lived with the canoe-borne marshmen of Iraq for several periods over the seven years up to the Iraqi revolution of 1958, attaining acceptance only by learning the unusual skill of circumcision.   </p><p>He still found time to travel in Kurdistan, Hunza (north-east Pakistan), Swat, Chitral (both north-west Pakistan), and Nuristan (across the border in north-east Afghanistan), where in 1956, 16,600ft up in the high passes, he bumped into a dispirited Eric Newby and friend Hugh Carless, and invited them to spend the night with him. They got on well until Thesiger saw them blowing up inflatable air-beds before retiring. \"You must be a couple of pansies!\" he said.  </p><p>He crisscrossed postwar Abyssinia, fought on the royalist side in the civil war in Yemen (1966-67), traversed most of northern Kenya, where he spent much time between 1968 and 1994, travelled with the Bakhtiari nomads in Iran, trekked across the burning plains of the Dasht-i-Lut, the Great Sand Desert of eastern Iran, and explored inner Afghanistan. All of these travels and many more - in total tens of thousands of miles - were made either on foot or by traditional transport, be it camel, horse, mule, donkey or canoe.   </p><p>Thesiger felt least at home in his own culture and with his own kind. He resented the juggernaut of western \"civilisation\" and its inexorable movement to squash what he believed was the colour and diversity of the earth's peoples. His sympathies were with the indigenes, and his closest human ties were with certain of them who were his companions on his many journeys - his Zaghawa servant in the Sudan, his Bedu companions in Arabia, his paddlers in Iraq and his Samburu family in Kenya. (\"Sex has been of no consequence to me, and the celibacy of desert life left me untroubled. Marriage would certainly have been a crippling handicap.\") Few other explorers of the last century have tried so genuinely to see the world through the eyes of these foreign peoples. Yet much as he despised civilisation, Thesiger was never able to forsake completely his place in it.  </p><p>Had he done so, he might never have left us his unique glimpses of strange worlds, in his classic books The Marsh Arabs (1964) and Desert, Marsh And Mountain (1979), his autobiography The Life Of My Choice (1987), his portfolio of superb monochrome photos, Visions Of A Nomad (1987), and above all his description of the traditional life of the Bedu, Arabian Sands (1959), probably the finest book ever written about Arabia and a tribute to a world now lost forever.  </p><p>He won the founder's medal of the Royal Geographical Society, together with three other medals from learned societies, honorary fellowships of Magdalen College, Oxford, and the British Academy, and an Honorary DLitt from Leicester University. In 1968, he was awarded a CBE, and in 1995 he was knighted.  </p><p>Yet, far more than these many honours, he valued the friendship and confidence of the nomadic peoples with whom and among whom he travelled. Thesiger's best years were the five he spent among the Bedu of South Arabia, and one cherished companion from those days, Salim bin Ghabeisha, when a greybeard in his 60s, remembered him: \"He was loyal, generous, and afraid of nothing. He was a wonderful man to travel with.\" Thesiger would, I am sure, ask no better epitaph.  </p><p><strong> Jonathan Glancey writes: </strong> I met Wilfred Thesiger for the first time last year. I thought he had been long dead, and told him so when we lunched together at his final, Betjemanesque retreat - all conifers, rhododendrons and sweeping gravel paths - in tamest Surrey.  </p><p>Wilfred found my assumption amusing. But, then again, he told me, the wild world of mountains, deserts, starlit skies and fierce tribes people he adored was all but dead. He raged eloquently, if quietly, against the dying of a world innocent of the motor car, advertising and what today we call global branding.  </p><p>Wilfred walked on the wild side. And how he walked. And how, through his crystal-clear prose and pin-point focused black and white photography, he affected generations of younger travellers, hopelessly romantic maybe, who still follow, knowingly or not, in his giant footsteps.  </p><p>He showed me the personal letter of invitation he had received from the Ras Tafari, the future emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, to his coronation in Addis Ababa in 1930. It was a magical moment, holding history in my hands from the hands of a brave and deeply complex man who had lived through such histories that most of us can only dream of.  </p><p>By chance, the day we met we were wearing, despite the age gap, identical tweed jackets. This may be a trivial detail, but I like to think that the spirit of this most quixotic, puzzling yet clear-eyed officer, gentleman and explorer will continue to be handed down from questing generation to questing generation. </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Wilfred Patrick Thesiger, explorer, born June 3 1910; died August 24 2003</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2003/aug/27/booksobituaries.obituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2003/aug/27/booksobituaries.obituaries","sectionName":"Travel"},{"webTitle":"Extracts from the late Wilfred Thesiger's autobiography","webPublicationDate":"2003-08-27T14:42:18Z","sectionId":"books","id":"books/2003/aug/27/extract.travel","fields":{"body":"<p>I was born in 1910, the eldest of four brothers, in one of the mud buildings that initially housed the legation at Addis Ababa where my father was a British minister. Indistinct recollections of camels and of tents, of a river and men with spears, and one vivid picture of my father shooting an oryx when I was three - these are among my earliest memories. But these early memories of desert travel are almost gone, overlaid by later ones of the Abyssinian highlands, for it was there I lived till I was nearly nine. </p><p>The golden broom in the garden; iridescent sunbirds among the flowers; the juniper bushes and red gullies behind the house; our syce waiting with the ponies; a camp by a waterfall, the dipping flight of green and chestnut bee-eaters, and the crimson flash of a touraco's wings among the trees - these are a few pictures that spring to mind from scores of others.  </p><p>I remember sitting beside my father in the twilight above a gorge, hoping he would get a shot at a leopard; I remember looking for bloodstains and cartridge cases near a small bridge where there had been a fight; listening to my father as he read to me of big game hunting and ox wagons and Zulus, from Jock of the Bushveld, as the sun went down behind Wochercher; watching in shocked disbelief the lance head come out through the shoulder of our favourite sowar when he had an accident getting on his horse, his grey face and closed eyes as I sat miserably beside him after my brother Brian had galloped off for help. He had dismounted to show us a bird's nest. I can see again the white-robed priests dancing in line before the Ark of the Covenant to the beat of silver drums, surrounded by other priests in richly-coloured robes, holding silver crosses in their hands.  </p><p>Above all I can remember some of the events during the rebellion of 1916 when Lij Yasu was deposed: watching the armies going forth to fight, a seemingly chaotic flood of warriors, mounted and on foot; jostling women driving mules inexorably northward; overhearing the news that Ras Lul Seged's army had been wiped out and that Negus Michael, Lij Yasul's father and king of the north, was advancing on Addis Ababa; seeing Ras Tafari, later to become Haile Selassie, walk up the legation steps when he brought his infant son to my father for safekeeping, before he went north to give final battle; hearing the mass rifle-fire in the town, celebrating the news of overwhelming victory.  </p><p>Two days later the army came in. Throughout the day they poured past the Royal Pavilion to the thunder of war drums and the blare of trumpets. They were still frenzied with the excitement of that desperate battle, when 60,000 men fought hand-to-hand on the plains around Sagale. The blood on the clothes they had stripped from the dead was barely dry. All of them carried shields and brandished rifles, spears or naked swords. Most of them were in white, but the chiefs were in full panoply of war, lion-mane head-dresses, velvet cloaks of many colours, long silken shirts;   their shields were embossed with silver or gilt as were the scabbards of their swords. Above this endless tide of men the banners dipped and danced, red, gold and green, the colours of the empire. Wave after wave, horsemen and men on foot, mixed in seeming confusion, they surged past throughout the day, thrusting close to the steps of the pavilion to boast of their prowess, while the court chamberlains beat them back with wands.  </p><p>Negus Michael was led past with a stone on his shoulder in token of submission, an old man in a black burnous with a white cloth wrapped about his head. Ras Lul Sege's young son came past at the head of a few hundred men, all that were left of the 5,000 who had fought beside his father at Ankober. I remember the excited face of a boy, seemingly little older than myself, who was carried past in triumph. He had killed two men. At last it was over - a small English boy had watched a sight as barbaric and enthralling as was ever seen in Africa.  </p><p>Looking back, I realise that my exciting and happy childhood in Abyssinia, far removed from direct contact with the western world, implanted in me a life-long craving for adventure among untamed tribes in unknown lands.  </p><p>One year after my exploration of the Danakil desert in 1934, the Italians invaded Abyssinia, and in the course of their operations occupied Aussa. In 1939, the very year after my journey to the mountains of Tibesti, across deserts where no car had ever penetrated, war was declared; in the course of it, motorised Free French forces were assembled there, at Faya, to drive north into Tripolitania. Then, in 1950, even as I was leaving Arabia after exploring the empty quarter for five years with my Bedu companions, the oil companies were already negotiating to prospect the hinterland of Oman; there, as elsewhere in Arabia, their industrial activities destroyed for ever the immemorial life of the desert Arab. In 1977, when I briefly returned to Oman and Abu Dhabi, I saw at once that present-day Arabia, with its prodigious wealth, had nothing whatever left to offer me.  </p><p>Much of the world, including many of the countries where I have spent years of my life, is now in chaos. The Sudan has been torn apart by chronic civil war between north and south, and is now devastated by drought in the western area, where the Zaghawa, Maidob, Bani Husain and other tribes, among whom I lived and served so happily, are dying in thousands of starvation. Over in Tibesti the Tedda, now equipped with automatic weapons and supported by Gadafy's Libyan troops, are engaged in yet another civil war. Meanwhile, Iraqi and Iranian armies are fighting desperately in the marshes of Iraq; while in the mountains of Nuristan, as elsewhere in Afghanistan, the tribesmen, who abominate their communist puppet government and are courageously resisting it, are being mercilessly attacked by Russian troops and helicopter gunships. For me, however, the crowning tragedy is the fate of Abyssinia.  </p><p>In July 1969, I happened to be in Kenya, on the shore of Lake Rudolf, when I heard with incredulity from a naked Turkana fisherman that the \"Wazungu\" - as he called Europeans, including Americans - had landed on the moon. He had heard the news at a distant mission station. To him this achievement, being incomprehensible, was without significance; it filled me, however, with a sense of desecration, and of despair at the deadly technical ingenuity of modern man. </p><p>Even as a boy I recognised that motor transport and aeroplanes must increasingly shrink the world and irrevocably destroy its fascinating diversity. My forebodings have been amply fulfilled. Package tours now invade the privacy of the remotest villages; the transistor, blaring pop music, has usurped the place of the tribal bard. While I was in the desert with the Rashid, they would light a fire by striking a dagger blade against a piece of flint: now they hear the world's news on their radio, or watch it on their television set. Twenty-five years ago, their concern was on account of tribal raiding: now, it is on account of superpower dissension over arms control, and \"Star Wars\" of the future. The Rashid today, like the rest of us, know they face the possibility of nuclear annihilation.  </p><p>In any case, if we survive, the future of serious geographical exploration must be in outer space or in the ocean depths. Moreover, the means to carry it forward can only be attained by modern technology, and at enormous expense; the participants in each venture will inevitably be limited to the selected few. The surface of the globe, having now - thanks to the internal combustion engine - been thoroughly explored, no longer affords scope for the adventurous individual in search of the unknown.  </p><p>Journeying at walking pace under conditions of some hardship, I was perhaps the last explorer in the tradition of the past. I was happiest when I had no communication with the outside world, when I was utterly dependent on my tribal companions. My achievement was to win their confidence. Among my many rewards was, in Abyssinia, to have been the first European to explore the Sultanate of Aussa; in Arabia, to have reached the oasis of Liwa, and to have found the fabled quicksands of Umm al Sammim; and, in so many of my travels, to have been there just in time.   </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Extracted From My Life and Travels, an Anthology, by Wilfred Thesiger.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/aug/27/extract.travel","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2003/aug/27/extract.travel","sectionName":"Books"},{"webTitle":"Wilfred Thesiger","webPublicationDate":"2003-08-26T12:28:29Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/2003/aug/26/guardianobituaries","fields":{"body":"Once, in 1946, Wilfred Thesiger lay starving on a sand dune in Arabia's Empty Quarter for three days, waiting for his Bedu companions to bring back food and tortured by hallucinations of cars and lorries that could carry him to safety. <P>\"No,\" he later wrote, \"I would rather be there, starving as I was, than sitting in a chair, replete with food, listening to the wireless and dependent on cars to take me through Arabia.\" <P>As an explorer, Thesiger, who has died aged 93, recognised that satisfaction in attaining a goal was directly in proportion to the hardship and challenge involved in getting there. <P>He reserved the word \"abomination\" for both cars and aeroplanes and, throughout his life, resented the intrusion of any innovation post-dating the steam engine. <P>His mystical regard for tradition was a product both of his childhood in still-medieval Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), and an intense pride in his aristocratic forbears, the Barons Chelmsford. <P>Born in Addis Ababa, where his father was British minister, he grew up in the barbaric splendour of an imperial court, and was privileged to see a victorious and bloodied Abyssinian army marching through the city in the full panoply of war. It was an experience that he never forgot. <P>Daydreams of Africa were his means of escape throughout awkward and often unhappy schooldays at Eton, and his time at Magdalen college, Oxford. <P>At the age of only 23, he set off to explore Abyssinia's Awash River and the forbidding Aussa Sultanate with its Mar or Danakil nomads, chiefly noted for a disturbing tendency to kill men and carry off their testicles as trophies. <P>Such practices held little horror for Thesiger, who had survived tagging and flogging at Eton, and saw at least one young Afar, flushed from the exertion of slaughtering and mutilating four victims in a day, as \"the equivalent of a nice, rather self-conscious Etonian who had just won his school colours for cricket.\" <P>Thesiger gained his own blue, for boxing at Oxford, and like many an athletically talented young Oxbridge graduate of the 30s, sought a career in the country where \"blues\" were said to rule \"blacks\": the Sudan. <P>As an assistant district commissioner in the Sudan political service, he served in arid Darfur, and later in the steaming swamps of the Sudd, where one of his chief jobs was shooting tlions that attacked local herds. <P>It was in Darfur that he first learned to travel by fast riding camel with local companions, dressing as they did, eating food out of the same bowl, and asking nothing of technology but a good rifle, a torch and a compass. <P>During one leave, he completed a long and dangerous journey to the almost unknown Tibesti mountains in the Sahara. <P>In the second world war, he was a bimbashi (junior office) in the Sudan Defence Force, won the DSO fighting the Italians at Gallabat, and served under the idiosyncratic Orde Wingate in the liberation of Abyssinia. <P>He later fought with both Stirling's SAS in north Africa and the SOE among the Druzes in Syria. A chance meeting in the last year of the war brought him a job in FAO's anti-locust unit, and with it the opportunity to make his most famous journeys in the deserts of Arabia under its aegis. <P>Arabia's legendary Empty Quarter had been the goal of all Arabian explorers from Richard Burton onward and, although Thesiger was not the first to cross it, he was the first to explore it thoroughly, mapping the oasis of Liwa and the quicksands of Umm As Sam. <P>He crossed the desert with Bedu companions twice, and his trek across the western sands from the Hadhramaut to Abu Dhabi was the last and greatest expedition of Arabian travel. <P>During his journeys, he was caught up in inter-tribal raids, pursued by hostile raiders and arrested by the Saudi authorities. He travelled alone in the Hejaz, the Assir and Najran, and explored the Trucial coast and Dhofar in southern Arabia. <P>He lived with canoe-borne marshmen of Iraq over a period of seven years, attaining acceptance only by learning the unusual skill of circumcision. <P>He still found time to travel in Kurdistan, Hunza, Swat, Chitral and Nuristan where, 16,600 feet up in the high passes he bumped into a dispirited Eric Newby and friend Hugh Carless, and invited them to spend the night with him. <P>They got on well until Thesiger saw them inflating airbeds before retiring. \"You must be a couple of pansies!\" he said. <P>He criss-crossed postwar Abyssinia, traversed most of northern Kenya, travelled with the Bakhtiari nomads in Iran, trekked across the burning plains of the Dasht-i-Lut, and explored inner Afghanistan. <P>All these journeys and many more, totalling tens of thousands of miles, were made either on foot or by traditional transport, be it camel, horse, mule, donkey or canoe. <P>Thesiger felt least at home in his own culture and with his own kind. He resented the juggernaut of western \"civilisation\" and its inexorable movement to squash what he believed was the colour and diversity of the earth's peoples. <P>His sympathies were with the indigenes, and his closest human ties were with certain of them who were his companions on his many journeys: his Zaghawa servant in the Sudan, his Bedu companions in Arabia, his paddlers in Iraq and his Samburu family in Kenya. <P>Few other explorers of recent times have tried so genuinely to see the world through the eyes of these foreign peoples. <P>Yet, much as he despised civilisation, Thesiger was never able to completely forsake his place in it. <P>Had he done so, he might never have left us unique glimpses of strange worlds in his classic books Desert, Marsh and Mountain and The Marsh Arabs, his autobiography A Life of My Choice, his portfolio of superb monochrome photos, Visions of a Nomad and, above all, his description of the traditional life of the Bedu, Arabian Sands. <P>The latter is probably the finest book ever written about Arabia, and is a tribute to a world now lost forever. <P>Thesiger won the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society, together with three other medals from learned societies, honorary fellowships of Magdalen college, Oxford, and the British Academy, and an Honorary D. Litt. from Leicester University. In 1968, he was awarded a CBE.<P>Yet, far more than these many honours, he valued the friendship and confidence of the nomadic peoples with whom and amongst whom he travelled. <P>His best years were the five he spent among the Bedu of south Arabia, and one cherished companion from those days, Salim bin Ghabeisha, now a greybeard in his 60s, remembers him. <P>\"He was loyal, generous, and afraid of nothing. He was a wonderful man to travel with,\" he said.<P>Thesiger could, I am sure, have asked for no better epitaph. <P>&£149; Wilfred Thesiger, explorer, born June 3 1910; died August 24 2003"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/26/guardianobituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/news/2003/aug/26/guardianobituaries","sectionName":"News"},{"webTitle":"Making local languages count","webPublicationDate":"2003-08-21T01:24:34Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2003/aug/21/tefl","fields":{"body":"<p>Betty Diatta, 34, was attending adult literacy classes near Dakar, the Senegalese capital. The language of instruction was Diola, one of the six local languages the Senegalese government supports in its literacy programmes. But Betty, like many of her classmates, was frustrated. \"What use can I make of this language in everyday life?\", she demanded.</p><p>Betty illustrates the dilemma found all over Africa where French, or English, or Portuguese - languages inherited from the colonial powers - remains the dominant language of the civil service, commerce and academia. Africans with literacy skills in indigenous languages are finding themselves increasingly excluded from the jobs market and even literate social circles.</p><p>Throughout Anglophone Africa, English is seen as the key to economic empowerment and progress and is the preferred language of education in African classrooms. This preference has generated an Africa-wide debate - mother-tongue versus second-language education - which Unesco's international literacy institute describes as one of the most important challenges facing African countries this millennium.</p><p>Unesco encourages African countries to use indigenous languages for basic education. But pupils and parents seem to believe that a basic education in English, rather than a mother tongue, will give them the upper hand in schooling and the job market.</p><p>In a class of 30 at Motse Maria High School, just outside Pietersburg in South Africa, not one pupil wants to be taught in their mother tongue, according to a recent study for the pan south african language board. \"We don't find our mother tongue to be that important. You don't make overseas calls in your mother tongue; you don't use it in everyday life. It's not useful,\" one 16-year-old schoolgirl states.</p><p>But research has shown that schoolchildren learn better in their mother tongue - the language they know best - and a start in the vernacular actually enables them to perform better in other subjects as well, including a second language such as English.</p><p>This has been ignored in most of Africa. The reasons go beyond the economic value and prestige of English, or what is most pedagogically sound. They are rooted in broad social and political contexts and historical imperative. </p><p>English is a colonial language, and it continued to be the official language after independence in virtually all African countries that were under British rule. In some cases it was retained to avoid ethnic tensions; in all cases it was retained because of its prestige and association with power. In contrast, the vernaculars were viewed as backward and inferior so were not developed. Students were made to feel ashamed of their mother tongue and punished for speaking it.</p><p>In Kenya, for example, speaking in vernacular was forbidden in schools and punished. One popular method was to embarrass pupils by making them carry around the skull of some dead animal all day.</p><p>Today it is difficult to use indigenous languages because they have not been codified and standardised. So there is a shortage of teaching materials and trained teachers in the vernaculars. And this has often been used as an excuse for not adopting the vernaculars in schools.</p><p>Even the terms used to refer to vernacular languages are controversial. They include such terms as dialects, minority languages and undeveloped languages - all of which suggest that the languages are not rich in expression and are unsuitable for modern needs.</p><p>The long-standing neglect of indigenous languages has resulted in the popular belief that they are incapable of imparting a modern education, including science and technology. The prestigious status of the English language and its dominant role in globalisation, added to the absence of the political will to implement policies that promote the use of indigenous languages, have led to the almost complete marginalisation of mother-tongue education in most of Africa.</p><p>A lack of resources and the multiplicity of indigenous languages have also contributed to the problem. Africa's 700 million people speak more than 1,000 distinct languages. In Nigeria, for example, where English still holds sway despite a policy of instruction by mother tongue, around 400 languages are spoken by about 250 ethnic groups.</p><p>Aid agencies do not help: they tend to shun projects that do not advance the economic and political interests of their home countries. However, Unesco has teamed up with the World Bank to encourage African governments to review their education policies in order to improve basic education in local languages.</p><p>For these policies to work successfully African governments need to enlighten the public about the validity and usefulness of policies that promote education in indigenous languages. They must also demonstrate more serious commitment to promoting those policies themselves, and allocating adequate resources. Otherwise, the promotion of African languages will remain merely rhetorical, and English will continue to take the pride of place at the expense of local languages.</p><p>Peter Mwaura is deputy director of the United Nations information centre in Nairobi, Kenya</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/aug/21/tefl","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2003/aug/21/tefl","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Press review: Watch what you put in your vase","webPublicationDate":"2003-08-06T09:37:16Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2003/aug/06/theeditorpressreview.conservationandendangeredspecies","fields":{"body":"<p>Next time you consider buying cut flowers from the supermarket, think again.

The man,  who is not   named, is described by the Telegraph as \"allegedly a member  of the provisional   IRA's engineering department, which was responsible for  some of the most   sophisticated devices made by the terrorists\". It is also  suggested that he was   part of a Real IRA funding strategy similar to that used by the  Provisional IRA   in Columbia which involved swapping high-grade technology  for millions of   dollars. Only in passing does the paper say: \"The man  held by the Israelis   is not thought to have any terrorist convictions, though he is  believed to have   been active in the IRA for a decade.\" <P>In fact, although it is quite clear that the papers know who  this man is, it   seems he has never even been charged, presumably because  the evidence against   him is not admissible. This accentuates the difficulties facing  Mr Blair over   the British prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Any decision to  charge them would rest   with the crown prosecution service, which might well decide it  would fail, leaving guilty men to go free.

He may be director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but he also holds an MIT teaching award as a MacVicar Fellow.</p><p>This reflects both his lucid and enthusiastic teaching style - \"nearly the entire class is actually participating in every lecture,\" said one colleague - and also what comes across as a natural belief in teaching and learning as an expression of democracy. </p><p>His introduction to psychology course was the prototype for MIT's open courseware programme, which allows the general public (or students at other universities) access to the course materials of the world-famous university. Emails to his MIT website receive thoughtful replies, signed \"Steve\". He accepts congratulations on his move to Harvard - \"institutionally in a month, physically end of summer\" - with a straightforward grace.  </p><p>Pinker sees his main strength as a teacher as \"explaining difficult concepts in ways people can understand, breaking them down, systematising them\". He takes care over analogies, trying to find one \"that goes to the heart of the concept that must be explained. It doesn't hurt to entertain, but if you just do that, students see through it very quickly.\"</p><p>His style also seems to inspire confidence in students; as one put it, following his teaching award, \"learning from Professor Pinker, all at once one feels smarter\".  </p><p>The main weakness in university teaching is, in Pinker's view, a tendency to \"have teaching reflect very closely the practices of research\". Too often, he says, teaching is based on presenting and analysing flaws and contradictions in research data. This, he says, \"leaves the student in a state of confusion. Why spend all this time on flawed experiments and false theories? Why can't we think about true theories and why things do work?  </p><p>\"You have to give people some kind of conclusion that is defensible, but not always focus on research techniques. For undergraduates, you want to convey some increased understanding, not get totally bogged down in contradictions and flaws.\"  </p><p>How far, then, can good teaching be made available to students in less prestigious institutions than MIT and Harvard? Pinker has had \"surprisingly little\" feedback from his internet course in terms of questions from readers, but was placed on an MIT committee to consider the consequences of the system. There was a fear that star professors would take courses they had developed in the institution, package them commercially and sell them.  </p><p>There was also a real fear that people would not share their work with other faculty members, and that the idea could be the end of the traditional, expensive, American university. Why pay $35,000 (&#163;21,000) a year to hear Pinker when you can pay $500 (&#163;300) to hear him on the internet? There was even thought of \"some New University of Costa Rica - students could work on their tan and fire up lectures by Stephen Jay Gould, Samuelson and other stars, with no need to go to the bother of hiring professors\".  </p><p>To date, MIT's internal analysis is much more optimistic, with over 92m visits to the open courseware site (44m from North America, 19m from western Europe, 17m from Eurasia, and just over half a million from Africa).  </p><p>Users include a group of refugee Ethiopian engineers from Kenya, a chemical engineer from India, and large numbers of teachers and students from other American universities.  </p><p>Despite snags with individual courses - the Shakespeare in Film and Media course, for example, is not fully accessible because of copyright problems - open courseware already allows students at any university access to the basic MIT course.  </p><p>However, Pinker sees a risk that the internationalisation of knowledge may not bring any increase in democracy. One reason is the high cost of scientific journals. Journal publishers, says Pinker, \"add virtually zero value, don't pay editors or writers, and make a fortune. All they ever did was smear ink on the paper and put copies in the mail.\"  </p><p>Contributors, including himself, have to pay to have their own work published, and do all the refereeing gratis. Pinker is \"fed up\" with all of this money going from libraries to publishers, and thinks the \"huge prices\" are keeping journals out of the reach of third world university libraries, and hence of \"bright kids in Africa and India\". Computers have changed the nature of publication, and he sees a revolt coming, beginning with mass resignations of academic staff from journals.  </p><p>Pinker is in London to promote the paperback edition of his book, The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature. While he sees the continuous, politicised debate over nature and nurture as \"banal\", he can't avoid it. Not least because what he sees as his main scientific evidence - studies of genetic factors in twins - is based squarely on an analysis of the effects of genes versus the effects of being raised in the same family.  </p><p>He has preserved himself from tar and feathers partly by his transparent commitment to freedom of thought, but also by quick thinking and careful phrasing. For example, he considers that IQ can account for individual differences in groups of people, but not for differences between groups, a distinction that removes him from the Bell curve racial controversy.  </p><p>Pinker acknowledges that the blank slate theory was never scientific, that no one believes in it any more, and even that it was based on the good intention of making racism, sexism and class prejudice \"factually untenable\".</p><p>But, somehow, its underlying tenet, derived from Locke's idea that our minds begin as \"white paper void of all characters, without any ideas\" grew into an \"official theory\", enforced by \"accusation, intimidation, name-calling and moralising intellectual questions that are questions of fact\".  </p><p>Pinker is not displeased with the idea that he has written the theory's obituary. He is rude about philosophers in his book (\"philosophy today gets no respect\") but appears more generous in conversation, recognising early philosophers, from Plato to Locke, as \"proto-scientists and armchair psychologists\".  </p><p>What has brought him most flak, he says, is his attack on modernism in art. Pinker thinks the decrease in the number of \"compelling\" works in music and painting can be traced to \"movements denying that there was any such thing as human taste or pleasure in art\". Art, he says, \"is in our nature, in the blood and in the bone,\" and \"artists are sexy\".</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature is published by Penguin, price £7.99</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/jun/24/elearning.highereducation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2003/jun/24/elearning.highereducation","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Obituary: Thomas Odhiambo","webPublicationDate":"2003-06-23T07:51:32Z","sectionId":"education","id":"news/2003/jun/23/guardianobituaries.highereducation1","fields":{"body":"The passion of the Kenyan scientist Thomas Odhiambo, who has died aged 72, was to harness science and technology in the service of Africa's poor. He was part of a generation of visionaries who gave the continent its first home-grown institutions of learning after independence from Britain and France, and rallied the international community in support. <P>Odhiambo helped to establish three institutes of higher education - the Third World Academy of Sciences in Trieste, Italy, in 1983; the Kenya National Academy of Sciences in Nairobi in 1983; and the African Academy of Sciences, also in Nairobi, in 1985. In 1970, he set up the departments of entomology and agriculture at the University of Nairobi, as well as the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (Icipe) in Nairobi. <P>He also founded a children's science publishing house in Kenya, a secondary school near Mombasa, and wrote six books for children.  <P>Though the Kenyan capital remained the focus of much of his later life, Odhiambo was born in Mombasa, one of the 10 children of a telegraph officer, and was an outstanding student at the CMS Maseno school, one of Kenya's leading public schools, where he took his Cambridge overseas school certificate in 1949. From 1950 to 1953, he studied biology at Makerere University College in Uganda, where, among other things, he edited the Journal of Vernacular Studies.  <P>In 1959, after four years as an entomologist at the Ugandan ministry of agriculture, he went to Cambridge University, where he took the natural sciences tripos in 1962, and a PhD in insect physiology in 1965. He spent the next five years teaching zoology at the University of East Africa in Nairobi.  <P>The International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (Icipe) epitomised Odhiambo's vision of a research institution that worked on problems faced by ordinary people, while building Africa's fledgling base of scientists. The idea was simple: Africa's agriculture was vulnerable to insects. Pesticides were one solution, though they killed off much more than pests. Odhiambo's answer was to give farmers low-cost biological and ecological tools to control insects, without using synthetic chemicals.  <P>Biological control of insects was a gamble. It had not been tried in Africa, and it remains controversial. In 1993, for example, Icipe scientists began to introduce Pakistan-bred wasps into Kenya to help eradicate a moth larva that was destroying nearly half of Kenya's maize crop. The technique worked and larvae populations have come down by as much as 50% in some areas.  <P>Odhiambo was a keen spotter of talent, but also wary of brain-drain. He recognised that holding on to talented people in Africa was always going to be a challenge against the lure of higher salaries and better conditions in Europe or north America. For him, Icipe's greatest legacy was that most of its 160 PhD-trained scientists are still working in Africa.  <P>By the early 1990s, however, Odhiambo was beginning to clash with Icipe's international donors and governing body over its administration and direction. He wanted to turn Icipe into a university providing teaching and training; his detractors wanted it to focus on improving its management and research. They also felt that he had been in the job too long and had too many outside interests - in effect, that he had become too powerful to control.  <P>In 1994, he was removed from the helm of Icipe by its governing body. It was a massive blow; his reputation had been built in the cause of self-reliance for Africa, yet his fate was being decided by foreign governments and donor agencies. To this day, the centre's website contains no mention of its founder. <P>He spent the last decade consolidating the African Academy of Sciences and lobbying African heads of governments to invest in more and better science, through his organisation, the Kenya-based Research and Development Forum.  <P>With one or two exceptions, few of Africa's post-colonial leaders bought into the idea of knowledge-based development. This is partly because lending agencies like the World Bank were guiding many African states through economic liberalisation and did not consider building universities or investing in knowledge as a priority for poor countries.  <P>Odhiambo was was married twice and is believed to have had six children.  <P><B>&#183;</B> Thomas Risley Odhiambo, scientist, born February 4 1931; died May 26 2003"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jun/23/guardianobituaries.highereducation1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/news/2003/jun/23/guardianobituaries.highereducation1","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Observer Comment Extra: We can deliver Africa's renaissance","webPublicationDate":"2003-06-15T02:10:21Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2003/jun/15/southafrica","fields":{"body":"The African continent has greeted this new century fired with the energy to turn the tide for the better. After decades of colonialism, retrogression, civil strife, dictatorships and poverty, the sun rising on the horizon must herald glowing signs of a new dawn.<P>A new generation of African leaders, technocrats, businesspersons, scholars, civil society, intellectuals, peasants and urban working and middle classes have emerged, resolved to see the new day in. Citizens of Africa have taken their destiny into their own hands. They have through the exercise of their will in countries across the continent, unequivocally shown that they no longer countenance military dictatorships, undemocratic regimes, rigged elections, poor governance and mal-administration, poverty and malnutrition.<P>Recent and ongoing political changes in the institutions of continental  governance mirror this hard-nosed determination to usher in the new era. The end of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), formed in 1963 by former colonial African states to assist and support anti-colonial struggles and the struggle against Apartheid symbolised the closing of a chapter, but also the opening of a new one in Africa's search for a new identity.<P>The OAU gave way to the African Union (AU) in July last year after having achieved its primary objective of decolonising the African continent and abolishing apartheid. The AU and Nepad - its socio-economic plan for regeneration - has become the continent's institutional response in a post-liberation globalised world, to the national, continental and international imperatives and challenges that face the continent today. <P>The creation of the AU signaled an honest acknowledgement by Africa and its leaders that much still needed to be done in relation to post-liberation challenges of clean governance, human rights, democracy, the rule of law and  most importantly, development.<P>Conceptually and structurally the AU was therefore designed to create, support, and protect a sustainable culture of democracy on the continent,  informed by the realisation that poor governance and the lack of democracy in post-colonial Africa have been among the underlying causes of Africa's continued  underdevelopment. The structures of the AU will over time, impact positively on strengthening the developing consensus of the continent on its needs and solutions.<P>Today Africa's challenges remain, slow economic growth that breeds poverty; limited regional trade arising from poor infrastructure; exclusion from international markets; the debt burden; malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and Aids; as well as regional and intra-national conflict which results in senseless death and displacement of innocent persons, especially women and children.<P>Yet achievements over the past few years show that Africa's citizens and the new generation of African leaders are intent on making a difference. All the problems that have paralysed African societies, freezing them out of the ongoing global context of technological development, economic growth, modernisation of infrastructure and educational progress, are being addressed - painstakingly but thoughtfully - by the AU and through Nepad.<P>Although it may be argued that some African democracies needs maturing, what  is beyond doubt is that a democratic ethos prevails on the continent and most African countries now do have democratic governments.<P>The recent successful presidential elections in Nigeria - the most populous country on the African continent - is a case in point. Last year's elections in Kenya which saw the peaceful hand-over of power after President Daniel Arap Moi's 24-year rule, is another significant milestone. These experiences have been replicated across the continent in the last decade or so. Thanks to a vibrant civil society and a new political leadership there is a burgeoning democratic ethos on the continent today.<P>Africa realizes that development is predicated on sustainable peace and stability. Consequently, the leadership of the African Union, under President Mbeki of South Africa, has intervened decisively to seek to resolve the remaining African conflicts and prevent future ones.<P>Yet, a key challenge of the continent is located outside of the continent. It remains confronted by a world financial, investment and trade regimes which unfairly favour the developed world and prevent it from improving the quality of life of its people. Skewed investment patterns, unfair trade barriers, protectionist policies, and huge agricultural subsidies in the West, continue to undermine its development efforts.<P>Africa evidently needs the partnership of the developed nations. NEPAD requires resources from wealthy countries because Africa cannot on its own overcome the development challenges accumulated over many centuries. Yet NEPAD is more about undoing the blockages to Africa's development than about asking for money. These challenges include removing impediments to trade and investment, facilitating technology transfers, improving communications and transport infrastructure, preventing wars and promoting health and education on the continent.<P>To this effect, at the recent G8 Summit in Evian, France, African leaders asked their G8 counterparts to speed up the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers that penalize African countries in precisely the areas where African countries ought to have a strong competitive advantage. Such impediments to trade exacerbate food insecurity in Africa because they prevent African countries from exporting processed agricultural products, while foodstuffs are imported into Africa with devastating results on Africa's small farmers. A 50 per cent cut in tariffs and subsidies would in effect amount to three or four times the current aid to the continent. As Ugandan President Museveni recently said \"we are asking for an opportunity to compete, to sell our goods in western markets. In short, we want to trade our way out of poverty\". Fair trade is a critical building block for Africa's sustainable development.<P>Africa is not stagnant. It is forging ahead with efforts to integrate  regionally and with other developing countries. Only last month (May) the African continent celebrated Africa Day on the 40th Anniversary of the founding of the OAU. It was an occasion where African people reaffirmed their dedication to take the development of their continent into their own hands.<P>Africans are inspired to face the future with renewed vigour, loyalty and dedication, confident that the worthy successor to the OAU, the African Union, and its development programme, NEPAD, will take them forward towards the achievement of the goals of African unity, peace, democracy and prosperity for all.<P>Should the West partner us, we have no doubt that the benefits will flow both ways - and that we will move more rapidly towards our goals.<P><B>&#183;</B> Dr Frank Chikane is Director General of the Presidency in the government of South Africa"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/15/southafrica","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2003/jun/15/southafrica","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Africa's Aids drugs trapped in the laboratory","webPublicationDate":"2003-05-21T01:25:48Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2003/may/21/aids.rorycarroll","fields":{"body":"There is no lock on the door, no phalanx of guards, no visible impediment to the drugs leaving the glass chamber that the laboratory technicians call a \"stability room\". The pills come in little white boxes with labels such as lamivudine, zidovudine and efavirenz, technical names disguising the fact that these tablets are the stuff of life. <P>Take them together and if you have HIV you can stave off death for years. Millions in Africa have the virus but not the pills. A stone's throw from the laboratory Aids is wiping out communities, yet these pills cannot leave the stability room.  <P>This is Nairobi, the factory is Kenyan, and a web of influence spun by the world's pharmaceutical giants encloses its labs, ensuring the Aids drugs stay inside. For Africa, getting them out would be a milestone in controlling the pandemic.  <P>Two things are happening which could untangle the web. Activists are preparing a legal challenge to allow Kenya to make and import generic Aids drugs. And Nairobi's factories are boosting their capacity to make their own cheap drugs in expectation of that court victory.  <P>For decades, African companies have produced generic copies of antibiotics and other drugs, paying royalties to those western companies which developed and patented the formulas. Prices tumbled, making them affordable to the poor.  <P>But that has not happened with Aids. The western companies, fearing for profits and market share, have refused permission for generic copies of drugs known as anti-retrovirals (ARVs).  <P>But in the labs of Nairobi manufacturers such as Cosmos they sense change coming. Following World Health Organisation guidelines, they have successfully copied branded Aids drugs, registered them with health authorities, printed labels for the boxes and stored them in the stability room. Under international patent law, there they must stay unless the makers obtain a licence.  <P>\"There is nothing preventing me mass producing. We have the expertise, the access to raw materials, the registration,\" said Prakash Patel, Cosmos's chairman and managing director. \"By the end of the year we will be producing. I think we will be the first to produce ARVs in Africa.\"  <P>Dr Patel's boast reflects swelling confidence that the multinationals will not block African generics. Another Nairobi firm, Laboratory &amp; Allied, also said it could switch to ARVs within weeks.  <P>That optimism stems from a series of victories in recent years which asserted the right of countries facing public health emergencies in the developing world to override intellectual property rights by issuing what is called a compulsory licence to make or import generic drugs.  <P>Countries such as Britain issue compulsory licences occasionally, giving the   NHS cheaper drugs, but African states have hesitated: the drug giants have friends in Washington and other capitals who can withdraw investment and trade concessions from uppity African states.  <P>But such a threat has now receded. The World Trade Organisation's Doha declaration said that developing-world countries could make or import generics. Even President Bush wants cheaper drugs for Africa.  <P>Yet the drugs industry is fighting back, by cutting prices of branded drugs, warning health ministers that national treatment programmes would bankrupt their budgets, and depicting generics as unsafe.  <P>John Musunga, commercial director of GlaxoSmithKline's Nairobi office, said the firm had no plan to stop generics, yet pinned on his wall was a strategy apparently advocating the \"promotion of doubt\" of generics. Mr Musunga also rejected claims that the industry exerted improper influence over the Kenyan government.  <P>Two years ago, an amendment protecting patents was slipped into Kenyan legislation. After an outcry it was removed. The Guardian has obtained a letter from Kaplan &amp; Stratton, a Nairobi legal firm, to the Kenya industrial property office, requesting an amendment for an unnamed client.  <P>But the momentum towards African generics is growing. The Consumer Project on Technology (CPTech), a not-for-profit group started by the radical   American campaigner Ralph Nader, is coaching groups in South Africa, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya to mount legal bids for compulsory licences.  <P>The plan is to reassure African governments that the international climate has changed. The prize is not just lower prices, but more sustainable supplies suited to Africa, such as all-in-one pills. Kenya seems to be moving fastest, with some government officials enthusiastically backing the initiative.  <P>\"The first case you get in Africa is going to have a huge effect on other African countries. If it's a positive decision they'll look to that, it'll have a domino effect,\" said James Love, of CPTech. \"We should succeed in Kenya. It would be a crime against patients if we don't succeed.\"  <P>In Nairobi's biggest slum, Kibera, they are waiting. M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res has identified candidates for ARVs, people such as Kevin Wanjala, 11, who was born with HIV and has been chronically sick.  <P>Shy and small for his age, he was at the top of his class in his favourite subject, English, before dropping out due to illness. \"When I grow up I'd like to be a car mechanic,\" he says. Kevin is nearing full-blown Aids, said Florence Olanya, an MSF nurse.

In the past week, and for the first time since September 11, Osama bin Laden's network has used dozens of suicide bombers against soft targets of civilians in restaurants and residential areas. <P>Even the bombings in the tourist resort of Bali, although they killed more than 200, used only one or maybe two suicide bombers.  <P>The extent of the planning and the recruitment that went into the Morocco and Saudi attacks, where a total of 23 people blew themselves up in coordinated attacks, as well as devastating explosions in Chechnya, indicate that al-Qaida is again and a force to be reckoned with.  <P>While the Bush administration - and British ministers - trumpeted the collapse of al-Qaida's base in Afghanistan and the arrest of some of the organisation's leaders, intelligence agencies have been far more sceptical.  <P>Defensive measures taken by some countries, notably in western Europe, meant that al-Qaida-inspired and funded groups and individuals were deterred from attacking prestige targets such as American military bases and official buildings of western or pro-western governments.  <P>But that in turn encouraged a shift in tactics towards soft targets. Bali, Casablanca and Riyadh, the Saudi capital, are vivid examples of the tactic.  <P>Jonathan Stevenson, author of the International Institute for Strategic Studies' (IISS) annual strategic survey published last week, described the Riyadh bombings as the first indication that the regime change in Iraq - in the short term - is going to cause a terrorist backlash and be an inspiration for terrorists. Although the audacity and sheer power of the American-led invasion could have a \"suppressive effect\" on terrorists, it was equally likely that the conflict had increased al-Qaida's recruiting power, he said.  <P>A fresh warning by Germany's BND, the equivalent of Britain's MI5, emphasised the point. According to German newspaper reports over the weekend, the agency says the al-Qaida network's support and potential for recruitment remains intact in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.  <P>The network's morale had been boosted by the suicide bombings in Riyadh and by America's decision to withdraw most US troops from Saudi Arabia and send home non-essential embassy staff and dependants.  <P>The theory of intensifying al-Qaida activity is also reinforced by senior American counterterrorism officials who were reported this weekend as saying that leaders of the terror group had reorganised bases of operations in at least a half-dozen locations, including Kenya, Sudan, Pakistan and Chechnya.  <P>The leaders had begun to recruit new members, train them and plan new attacks on western targets in earnest, the New York Times reported. It cited as evidence secret arrests in the US in the last two months of two Arab men suspected of having been sent by the al-Qaida leadership to scout targets for terror attacks.   <P>The newspaper said US officials would not identify the two men, who were described as conducting \"presurveillance\" activities. They were part of a larger group of about six al-Qaida followers arrested in recent months whose presence in the US had led the authorities to conclude that the terrorist network remained determined to carry out attacks on US soil.  <P>Reflecting this concern the Foreign Office warned last week of a clear terrorist threat not only in Kenya, but also Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda.  <P>The decision to suspend British Airways flights to Kenya was linked to intelligence that Fazul Abdulah Mohammed, suspected of being behind the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, had returned to Kenya.  <P>The American counterterrorism officials also said al-Qaida was trying to develop explosives which were harder to detect, to be placed in shoes or luggage, and would be used to blow up a passenger aircraft. It is unlikely, the officials said, that a terrorist team would follow the example of the September 11 hijackers, spending months in the US before a new attack. More probably, they would remain abroad until they chose the time to strike.  <P>Meanwhile signals to al-Qaida supporters seem to be appearing at a steady rate.  <P>Messages may be sent to al-Qaida net works or sympathisers in different ways. In a tape issued three months ago, at a time when the US was concentrating on Iraq, a voice widely agreed to be that of Osama bin Laden described Morocco and Saudi Arabia, as well as Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, and Yemen, as targets for \"martyrdom operations\".    <P><B> New threats</B><P>Last month, Mohammed al-Ablaj, who described himself as a commander of a \"mojahedin training centre\" for al-Qaida, announced that it was preparing \"an intensive strategic course to make America pay for its invasion of Iraq\" and hit \"other targets soon and often\".  <P>It was reported yesterday that al-Ablaj has sent an email to al-Majalla, a Saudi-owned London-based magazine, warning of \"new and more severe strikes which will surprise the Americans and Israelis alike\". In another email, Thabet ibn Qais has described himself as a new spokesman for al-Qaida and said the network had \"carried out changes in its leadership\".  <P>Whatever the significance of these developments, European security and intelligence sources say it would be a mistake to regard al-Qaida as a centralised, disciplined organisation along the lines of groups such as the IRA. The sources describe, rather, a network of \"local Islamist groups affiliated to the aims of al-Qaida\".  <P>Thus the Bali bombing was carried out by Jemaah Islamiya. In Morocco, extremist groups with links to al-Qaida include Salafia Jihadia and Attakfir wal Hijra. There are hosts of other groups with links to what is seen as a burgeoning al-Qaida movement, ranging from Morocco to Malaysia and the Philippines.  <P>The IISS describes al-Qaida as a \"potent transnational terrorist organisation that could take a generation to dismantle\", adding that \"thanks to technology and the multinational allure of jihadism, the Afghanistan camps were &#91;now&#93; unnecessary\". The only infrastructure al-Qaida required was safe houses to assemble bombs and weapons caches.  <P>\"Otherwise, notebook computers, encryption, the internet, multiple passports and the ease of global transportation enabled al-Qaida to function as a 'virtual' entity that leveraged local assets - hence local knowledge - to full advantage in coordinating attacks in many 'fields of jihad',\" says the IISS.  <P>Al-Qaida has no state to defend, allowing it to maintain \"a flat, transnational, and clandestine organisational scheme\". Its leadership - and the term itself may be a misnomer - thus leaves actual terrorist attacks to \"local foot-soldiers\", as happened in the Bali bombings and others since, including those in Casablanca.  <P>The \"multinational allure of jihadism\" meant that any bombers who were lost could easily be replaced."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/19/alqaida.terrorism2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2003/may/19/alqaida.terrorism2","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Terror crackdown has not reduced al-Qaida threat, warns thinktank","webPublicationDate":"2003-05-14T01:04:27Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2003/may/14/uk.alqaida","fields":{"body":"Al-Qaida remains a \"potent\" international terrorist network with more than 18,000 trained members at large in up to 90 countries, and could take a generation to dismantle, a leading international affairs thinktank warned yesterday. <P>The warning came in the annual strategic survey of the International Institute for Strategic Studies whose author, Jonathan Stevenson, said the Riyadh bombings \"bore the hallmarks\" of an al-Qaida operation.  <P>The bombings \"may be the first indication that the regime change in Iraq in the short term is going to cause a terrorist backlash and be an inspiration for terrorists\", he added.  <P>Although the audacity and sheer power of the American-led invasion could have a \"suppressive effect\" on terrorists, it was equally likely that the conflict \"increased al-Qaida's recruiting power\", he said.  <P>The report warns that al-Qaida has reconstituted itself since the war in Afghanistan and was now \"doing business in a somewhat different manner, but more insidious and just as dangerous as in its pre-September 11 incarnation\".  <P>It describes al-Qaida as a \"potent transnational terrorist organisation that could take a generation to dismantle\". With improved European and American defences, al-Qaida could \"content itself with softer high-value targets\".  <P>The report says that the US and its allies have had some successes against al-Qaida, with about 2,700 known or suspected terrorists arrested, including its operations chief, Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the third in command.  <P>They have captured or killed 10 \"senior leaders\" as well as some 2,000 rank and file members, the institute says.

This makes it impossible to give a \"correct\" size for the Windows folder, though I would expect it to be closer to 1.2MB than      600MB. </p><p>      There is no failsafe way of cleaning out the Windows directory that saves a significant amount of space. I usually do it by      reformatting the hard drive and re-installing everything from scratch. This is not a good idea unless you have complete      back-ups and know what you are doing. Also, since hard drive space now costs about £2 per gigabyte, this is not necessarily      a cost-effective approach.       </p><p><strong>How much?</strong><br />      I'm selling my PC to my parents, but I'm not sure how much to ask. It is a Packard Bell Pulsar C433 (433MHz Celeron      processor, Windows 98), which cost £850 in 1999. I have also upgraded the memory and graphics card and added a DVD      drive. <br />      <strong>Chris Whalen</strong></p><p>    <strong> JS:</strong> The second-hand value of a PC bears no relation to the original cost, but is capped by the price of new machines. Since      you can now get a fast Pentium 4 PC with Windows XP for less than £500, it is hard to get more than about £250 for the      average second hand model, and old machines are typically worth half that.

It has nothing to do with Windows Messenger, MSN Messenger or any other messaging application. Blockmessenger.com's author claims that \"the only way to block these spam messages _ required doing extensive tweaking and configuring of my computer,\" and offers to sell you a blocker for $29.95. This is a bad deal. </p><p>You can turn off this messenger service yourself, in one minute. Log on to Windows XP in administrator mode, go to the Control Panel, and open the Administrative Tools folder. Double-click the Services icon, and scroll down the Name column until you get to Messenger. Double-click Messenger to get the Properties sheet (or right-click it and select Properties), and then click the Dependencies tab. The lower box should be empty, which is to say, nothing depends on you running Messenger. </p><p>Go back to the General tab and look for the Service Status section. If Messenger is running, click Stop to stop it. Next, go to Startup type and click the down arrow on the right. Clicking the arrow lets you select Manual or Disabled, and you can select either. If Messenger has no dependencies, select Disabled and click OK to finish. You will not get any more Messenger pop-ups.    </p><p><strong> Clean desk</strong><br />    My desktop is full of stuff I've downloaded, and saved to desktop. Can I save these programs elsewhere? <br />  <strong> Brian Storer </strong> </p><p><strong>JS:</strong> It is unlikely that any of your programs are actually on the desktop, or are running from the desktop. If the icons have a small arrow on them, they are just shortcuts to the real programs. Any shortcuts you do not want, you can throw in the bin. You will get a message to tell you that this will not uninstall the program. If you have icons that don't have little arrows, they are probably files you have downloaded, such as Zone Alarm. </p><p>However, when you double-clicked the download to install it, the program files were extracted and installed somewhere else: in this case, they are probably in C:\\Program Files\\Zone Labs\\ZoneAlarm. You can therefore bin the file you downloaded and expect the program to keep on working, though it is wise to check first. If you want to keep files you have downloaded, you can use the mouse to drag them from the desktop and drop them in a folder, such as My Files, in Windows Explorer. However, it might be better to download these files directly to a folder such as C:\\My Downloads and keep them off the desktop altogether.  </p><p>You can also use Windows Explorer to remove icons and files from the desktop, or vice versa. In Windows 9x/Me, you can move a shortcut file from C:\\Windows\\Desktop to a folder in C:\\Windows\\Start Menu, and it will appear on the Start menu.

So what can it mean to have a \"creative industry\"? Are we to suppose that those working in the arts are more creative than bankers or plumbers?</p><p>It is indeed a uniquely uncreative use of language which labels our artistic endeavours a \"creative industry\", not least for the arbitrary way in which people as diverse as set designers, ticket salesman and seamstresses are lumped together. And if we can't understand what creativity is, how can we hope to see what it can do for us?</p><p>The essence of creativity, or course,  is in problem solving, from the problems of dentistry to the problems of air travel. And among the major problems facing us today are the challenges of new technology. In the creative industries as elsewhere, new technology is leading to ever-greater specialisation, where increasingly the people making the decisions are experts in their own fields but have little perspective on the bigger picture. </p><p>A perfect example of this can be found in the collapse of the dotcom bubble.  What problems do we think the digital revolution can help us solve? When many of the new capabilities are wasted on 3-G mobile phones, and interactive dramas which satisfy no one, one has to wonder what precisely is the \"knowledge\" at the heart of the \"knowledge economy\".  Of all the fibre optic cables laid in the world, only 5% are being used; a situation analogous to the explosive and unplanned expansion of rail networks in the 19th century, when many miles of unwanted track lay empty. </p><p>There is, in fact, a deep conservatism at the heart of the way these new technologies are used: the video games we play today are fundamentally identical to those of 20 years ago; the only thing that has changed is the sophistication of the graphics. It doesn't help that the CEOs and the CFOs behind the \"knowledge economy\",  for all their business school MBAs, are concerned only with balance sheets - so they shuffle the game titles, and rely on what has worked before. Two years after the bubble burst, the only thing that has changed in the new economy is that we are even more reliant than before on established business models.  Everything has become less radical, not more.</p><p>  This is also true in the way technologies have been adopted in the home.  Because the  internet was initially sold to people as a way of accessing services they already had, the true capabilities of the medium have never been exploited. The marketing helped put a 2Ghz PC in every home, but much of the time it sits there idle, like some rusting Victorian railway sleepers. </p><p>  The problem is simple: because of a lack of creativity in the way we put new technologies to use, their usefulness has to fabricated, by dressing up old services and activities in fancy new digital garb; the Emperor's new clothes, in fact.</p><p>  Because we know so little about the true extent of the development of new technologies, we can be misled about where innovation lies, and fall into misunderstandings based on new and spurious racial or ethnic categorisations.</p><p>Taiwan is not inherently more innovative than the UK. Its people are not naturally more  inventive than the people of Kenya, or of  Fiji. Quite simply, some in Taiwan strive to make the best of their situation using the circumstances they find themselves in, based only on a desire to give people products and services to make their lives easier. And this is where the principle of  progress based on commerce preached by capitalist doctrine falls down: for what, after all, is the new technology doing for us? We are being hoodwinked by the big corporations' need to offload products which trade on tired formulae, and fail even to employ the very innovations on which they are marketed. This is not about nationality or ethnicity - it is about policy. </p><p>The separation of disciplines is largely to blame for this situation; because the \"creative industries\" are separate from the \"knowledge economy\", the innovation they could bring is squandered. At the same time, people's understanding of the arts continues to decline.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/feb/18/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2003/feb/18/features","sectionName":"Film"},{"webTitle":"Review: The Travels of Ibn Battutah edited by Tim Mackintosh-Smith","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-21T23:41:01Z","sectionId":"books","id":"books/2002/dec/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview2","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>The Travels of Ibn Battutah</strong>edited by Tim Mackintosh-Smith<br />325pp, Picador, &#163;20</p><p>Ibn Battutah, the Moroccan who journeyed for a quarter-century across Asia and Africa on the eve of the black death, gives a picture of medieval civilisation without equal in detail and brilliance in The Travels. Translated from the Arabic in the 20th century by the orientalist scholar HAR Gibb and completed by the late Charles Beckingham, The  Travels were available in English only as single volumes in the antique book trade or as inky pirate editions from India and the Arab world.</p><p>This abridgement of the Gibb-Beckingham volumes by the British travel writer Tim Mackintosh-Smith is as good an introduction to the great masterpiece of Muslim geography as anyone could want.</p><p>Shaikh Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Battutah was born in Tangiers in 1304, the son of a judge of the Maliki school of Islamic law, and himself bred up as a jurist. He set off eastwards at the age of 21. He seems to have intended little more than to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is a religious duty for able-bodied Muslims, and to practise the law.</p><p>As he travelled east, his horizons began to open. In Alexandria, he dreamed of flying on the wings of a huge bird to Yemen, and then east and south, \"alighting in some dark and greenish country\". After performing the pilgrimage no fewer than five times, exploring Iraq, Iran and the Persian Gulf, descending as far as what is now Kenya and residing in the Christian capital of Constantinople, he passed by way of the Crimea, Central Asia and Afghanistan to the rich Muslim sultanate of Delhi, arriving in the early-to-mid-1330s.</p><p>Dispatched in 1341 by Sultan Mohammed bin Tughluq with presents on a mission to the Emperor of China, ibn Battutah was wrecked on the Malabar coast and lost the presents. Rather than risk returning to Delhi, he set up as a judge in the recently Islamised Maldive Islands.</p><p>Quarrelling with the civil authority after little more than a year, he made his own way to China by way of Ceylon, the Coromandel coast of India, Bengal and Sumatra. No doubt he wished to fulfil a famous saying attributed to the Prophet: \"Seek knowledge even to the borders of China.\"</p><p>Returning to the Maghrib and Spain across countries ravaged by the black death, ibn Battutah made a hair-raising journey across the Sahara to the kingdom of Mali, which he completed in 1353. He covers as much ground as Marco Polo a generation before, but seems to have relied less on second-hand reports. (Both men's accounts of, for example, Chinese paper money are unsatisfactory and it may be that they used the same source or group of sources.) A summary of the Travels was completed on behalf of the sultan of Morocco by ibn Juzayy in 1356. Little is known of his later career.</p><p>Ibn Battutah and Marco Polo were fortunate in their lifetimes. These were the years of the so-called \"Mongol peace\" in which the successors of Genghis Khan, having destroyed eastern Islam, including the city of Baghdad, had settled into generally peaceable principalities linked by open trade routes. Ibn Battutah's expertise in Islamic law was as saleable in territories newly brought within the Islamic fold as the Italian wares the Polos carried to the east.</p><p>As a traveller, ibn Battutah is wholly convinced of the superiority of his own culture (Sunni Islam of the Maliki rite) but curious about other rites and even non-Islamic civilisations. China, with its vast cities, astonishing technology and unbelief, unsettles him; Mali he finds plain uncivilised. Pharisaical and even fanatical at the outset, ibn Battutah is softened by his adventures. He retains both his faith and his humanity.</p><p>His personality is a war between contradictory impulses of mysticism and worldliness. Mackintosh-Smith prints the key passage, which occurs at a meeting in 1326 with a Sufi saint on the Shatt al-Arab near the town of Abadan (now the centre of the Iranian oil industry): \"For a moment,\" ibn Battutah writes regretfully, \"I entertained the idea of spending the rest of my life in the service of this shaikh, but I was dissuaded from it by the pertinacity of my spirit.\" This in Arabic is al-nafs al-lajuj: the relentless, importunate, animal spirit that the Sufi adept must overcome to advance in knowledge.</p><p>In ibn Battutah's case, this animal spirit was a love of women. Even while performing the circuit of the Kaaba in the shrine at Mecca, he is tormented by the scent still lingering on the hot pavement. \"The Meccan women... make a practice of performing the circuit of the House on the eve of each Friday, and come in their finest apparel, and the Sanctuary is saturated with the smell of their perfume.\" Whenever ibn Bat tutah has any money - and he is an inveterate sponge on royal courts - he buys one or several slave-girls.</p><p>In the Maldives, where he has fled the terrifying complications of the Delhi court to serve as a judge, he gives up on his attempt to oblige the local women to cover their breasts. On the mainland, he witnesses the practice of suttee, where a Hindu widow throws herself on to her husband's funeral pyre, and faints.</p><p>Mackintosh-Smith, who lives in Yemen, published a book last year of his own journeys along ibn Battutah's tracks in the eastern Islamic world, called Travels with a Tangerine. This is the better book. He has weeded out much of the first three volumes of Gibb's text, including the lists of which learned men were resident in Mecca between 1326 and 1332, and topographical descriptions of Jerusalem and Damascus. In their place, he prints almost all of ibn Battutah's paradisal sojourn in the Maldives and the account of his capture by thieves near Aligarh in 1342.</p><p>As he is dying of thirst, ibn Battutah's broad world collapses into a well without a bucket: \"I took a piece of cloth which I had on my head and tied it to the rope and sucked the water that soaked into it, but that did not slake my thirst. I tied on my shoe next and drew up water in it it, but that did not satisfy me either, so I drew with it a second time, but the rope broke and the shoe fell back into the well. I then tied on the other shoe and drank until my thirst was assuaged.\"</p><p>There is nothing like that in all medieval literature.</p><p>Mackintosh-Smith has kept many of Gibb's astonishingly learned footnotes, though on one occasion, in trying to pin down the Turkish-speaking tribes of southern Iran, he repeats a mistake of Gibb's and adds one of his own. The book's fault, which is not a serious one, is that Gibb began his stupendous translation in the 1920s and chose for it the orientalised English prose of 50 years before and the English verse (merles, ouzels) of 150. It is quite hard to be more prudish than an Arab traveller of the Middle Ages, but Gibb managed it.</p><p>What Mackintosh-Smith conveys in his abridgement is the sheer scope, both geographical and mental, of Islamic civilisation in its climactic phase between the Mongol devastations of the 13th century and the revival of Christendom in the 15th. At Sijilmasah, a place now in ruins to the south of the Atlas mountains in the Maghrib, ibn Battutah stayed with a jurist whose brother he had met at Qanjanfu (Fuzhou) on the Chinese mainland. \"How far apart they are,\" he comments.</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> James Buchan's most recent novel is  A Good Place to Die (Harvill Press)</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2002/dec/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview2","sectionName":"Books"},{"webTitle":"Cyber hype","webPublicationDate":"2002-12-05T01:45:57Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2002/dec/05/onlinesupplement","fields":{"body":"<p>Just hours after a surface to air missile passed within metres of an Israeli airliner in Kenya last week, media websites began humming. Internet chatrooms set up by Islamic sympathisers had been buzzing with rumours of an attack barely a week before. It was just one in a long line of hysterical media reports alluding to the way the internet has been co-opted by \"cyberterrorists\" for their evil ends. </p><p>Since September 11, for which much of the planning happened over email, cyber-terrorism - loosely defined as using computers to intimidate others to further political or social objectives - has become a useful buzzword. Governments have used it to justify ramping up internet monitoring and - some argue - a corresponding crackdown on civil liberties online. </p><p>The official fear is that religious or political zealots could, for instance, hack into a hospital computer system to change a ward's dosage of medicine; or switch  off a city's power supply; or change the operations at a sewage treatment works to poison the water.</p><p> In November last year, the European Union member states signed the Convention on Cybercrime. It was the first international treaty on crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks, dealing with infringements of copyright, computer-related fraud, child pornography and violations of network security. </p><p>It also contained a series of powers, such as the search of networks and \"legitimate interception\" of communications traffic. Europe is not the only one to resort to these methods. Last Thursday, President Bush signed legislation creating the new Homeland Security Department, which will bring together 22 federal agencies to help stop nuclear, chemical and biological attacks, and, specifically, cyberterrorism. </p><p>Japan is so concerned about the possibilities of cyberattack that they have thrown a virtual fence around the country to check email and web traffic. But Hollywood-style hacker scenarios such as those outlined in the latest James Bond movie are far removed from reality. At least, that's according to the people who should know: the hackers themselves. </p><p> As hackers and security consultants gathered last week for Dublin's <a href=\"http://www.hivercon.com\">Hivercon conference</a>, a newer and simpler argument was aired: that it is far easier to be a real-world terrorist than a virtual-world one.  </p><p>Simple Nomad is a senior security analyst for <a href=\"http://www.bindview.com\">BindView Corporation</a> and a founder of the <a href=\"http://www.nmrc.org\">Nomad Mobile Research Centre</a>, an internationally known group of hackers. He is concerned about how governments are using the cyberterrorist pretext to \"sniff\" personal email and web traffic.</p><p> \"Cyberterrorism is a catchy phrase and seems to be a hot topic. I'm not saying that a hack could never lead to someone's death, but it's much easier for a terrorist to throw a knapsack of poison into a reservoir than to do something remotely with a computer,\" he says. \"If I knew George Bush was going into hospital and would be on a life support system, conceivably I could interrupt the power grid or hit the back-up batteries in the middle of his operation. But most of these systems already have a lot of safeguards, mainly just to prevent simple accidents.\"</p><p> Nomad argues that the biggest hackers, in fact, are governments themselves. \"There are at least 10 governments out there - like the US, the British, the Germans, the  Chinese - with very sophisticated teams. In the name of cyberterrorism, there is more funding than ever going into the listening and data sniffing capability of governments.\"  </p><p>It is this capability that is often being used by countries to gain commercial advantage over other countries, not prevent terrorism, claims Nomad.  He says one of the biggest \"sniffers\" is the international Echelon project, set up by western governments to sniff the net, telephones, and almost everything digital to provide intelligence for the security services. </p><p>Most of Echelon is large scale, to do with all telecommunications - which is why, he says, national governments have had to introduce such legislation as the UK's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to be able to monitor pure ISP internet traffic.  </p><p>So can hackers really gain access to sensitive data? \"Most of the big stuff, like military systems, can't be accessed anyway. There are air-gaps - things not connected to the outside internet,\" says Nomad. He is dismissive of the recent case where Gary McKinnon, a 36-year-old former systems administrator from London, allegedly deleted files on a  server used by a US navy command centre between April and September of last year. Nomad believes this is a rare case and that the files could not have been sensitive if they were accessible via the net.</p><p> Tom Reeve, editor of <a href=\"http://www.securityvoice.co.uk\">Security Voice</a>  magazine, agrees: \"From a global perspective, I am far less concerned about cyberterrorism and hacking than acts of terrorism in the physical world. With bombs going off around the world and everyone wondering when al-Qaida will strike next, who cares if a web server gets hacked?\" </p><p> He admits he would be as annoyed as anyone if his web site was hacked or defaced: \"But you couldn't justify diverting large amounts of resources from anti-terrorism in the physical world to protect my assets in the virtual world.\"</p><p>That's the argument of Hivercon speaker <a href=\"http://www.thiemeworks.com\">Richard Thieme</a>, a consultant who is also contributing editor for Information Security Magazine and a regular speaker at the Black Hat Briefings and DefCon, the well-known hacker conferences. Thieme says some of these cases are legitimate causes for    concern, but that usually, cyberterrorism is a sideline affair.</p><p> \"It's a lot easier to blow up a pipeline in the middle of nowhere than it is to hack your way in over a computer terminal,\" he says. \"A single car bomb in the right place in Wall Street, in conjunction with the events of 9/11, would have taken out the US financial system. Not a hack.\" </p><p>Such \"force multipliers\" can make a terrorist attack a great deal worse. \"Using hackers in conjunction with real world events would have more impact, but just bringing down a web server does not,\" he says. Cyberterrorising is more often than not directed at opposing groups, rather than governments. </p><p>In the Israeli-Palestinian battle, criminal hackers, or \"crackers\", on both sides are constantly attacking one another's web sites. A Pakistani cracker once stole the credit card numbers of members of a pro-Israel lobbying group and posted them online. </p><p> Indeed, it is the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent, not western Europe, that have often been at the forefront of official attempts to block techno-terrorists.</p><p> Last week, Indian mobile phone companies were facing the prospect of a    government plan to tap into SMS (short messaging service) mobile mail services to combat malicious hackers.  And last year, the Yaha virus emerged to launch a rudimentary denial of service attack on the Pakistan government's website. But since then, computer hackers have reverted to type - going for corporate systems in the main.</p><p> According to Synstar, an information security company, 1,057 corporate organisations were hacked in September - a five-fold increase over the previous year's 225 attacks.  </p><p>Thieme is one of the first to admit that the internet - the ultimate \"network technology\" - helped create the events of September 11. Although America's intelligence communities were well aware of the threat posed by small bands of fundamentalists before 9/11, \"it brought home to them that the way power is distributed has been changed by network technology\", says Thieme.</p><p> In fact, in common with Simple Nomad, he points out that the US itself is capable of the biggest acts of cyberterrorism. \"The US has enough electronic warfare capabilities in its own right. High power microwaves can knock out command and control centres. It's not necessary to just hack the enemy's network. We did this in Kosovo, and in Iraq.\"  </p><p>\"Ultimately, the idea of a cyber Pearl Harbor is pure hype. The surrender of some liberties in the name of security is about physical security and terrorism, not cyberterrorism, which is a less important subset. People are much more worried about dirty bombs and gas attacks.\" </p><p>Thieme argues that the true cyber threat does not come in the traditional form of the disaffected hacker located in a remote country, but the insider - the guy who already knows all the passwords and works inside the system. </p><p>\"The next stage for technology is true globalisation. We'll see a single kind of flexible interface develop which unites all societies. So the biggest threat to society is an insider who uses our own technology like an insider - just as happened on 9/11.\" </p><p>In the final analysis, however, hackers saying they are not going to get involved in cyberterrorism is not going to be enough to call off the dogs and halt the data clampdown, even if some of the most sensitive systems are not directly connected to the internet. </p><p>Jason Hart, head of secu  rity with consultants  <a href=\"http://www.synstar.com\"Synstar/A> says: \"As far as we know, no one has died as a result of the work of a hacker, but we'll never know the true answer because of the nature of hacking. </p><p>'Good' hackers don't leave any trace of their incursion into a system. So, for instance, someone could hack into an airline system to change the weight allowance on an airliner's payload, causing the plane to crash on take-off or landing. </p><p>\"Everyone is aware of the physical threat to, say a reservoir, but at the end of the day, that threat has to be checked using computer systems, which are vulnerable,\" says Hart. He points to evidence that drug cartels have employed hackers to do such things as fooling banking systems to take a pound every month from 20,000 individual credit card accounts. </p><p>\"You can hide the fact that a pound goes missing and use that money to fund more hacking. Terrorists could use this model to fund their own activities. \"The biggest threat is ignorance - people believing it will not happen to them.\" </p><p>\r\n<strong>&#183;</strong> Comments to <strong>online.feedback@guardian.co.uk</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/dec/05/onlinesupplement","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2002/dec/05/onlinesupplement","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Fuad Nahdi: Tourism, US swagger and a new Islam have transformed Mombasa","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-29T14:24:48Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2002/nov/29/kenya.terrorismandtravel1","fields":{"body":"Yesterday's attacks in Kenya were shocking, but hardly surprising. Like Bali in Indonesia, Mombasa was once an idyllic tropical island. Now it is simmering with anger, consumed by hatred and sucked into the global mayhem that is \"the war against terror\". <P>On my last visit in August it was obvious that the entire community had undergone a massive change. For the first time I felt a stranger in the town I was born in and among the relatives and friends I grew up with.  <P>But the process that has converted Mombasa - once associated with the Swahili song Hakuna Matata (No Problem, theme song of the Lion King) - into the latest theatre of conflict in the terror wars is a complex mixture of global politics, negligence and religion.  <P>Thirty years ago, this predominantly Muslim and ethnically mixed town was a model of communal harmony and co-existence. Western visitors to the Old Town were almost forced to stop and share a cup of tea. Today, they need armed police escorts to guide them around the old alleys and sites.  <P>I grew up surrounded by mosques full of imams and scholars who oozed wisdom and dignity. Their discourse was love-based and God-centred. Today, the sermons echo a message of anger, frustration and hate. As president of the Muslim Students Union at the University of Nairobi, I was obsessed with so many local concerns that Palestine never made it to the top five. Today, Israel and the plight of the Palestinian people is on the tongue of every Kenyan Muslim you speak to. Then it was only us young people who admired the Islamic revolution and the Ayatollah Khomeini: today, young and old, men and women, they all adore Osama bin Laden.  <P>The transformation is total. Tourists are no longer seen as friendly neighbours who have come to share. A young man outside a mosque told me they were the \"vanguard of western cultural decadence and exploitation\". Despite the massive growth of the tourism industry, only a limited number of local people have a stake in it. It is not only seen as a way of exploiting the local people - all tourist-related industries are either owned by foreign multinationals or non- Muslims - but also a way of corrupting society.  <P>Perhaps western tourists by themselves could be tolerated, up to a point. But US soldiers visiting town, most seeking \"entertainment\", have become particularly unacceptable. They are associated with gambling, prostitution and excessive alcohol. Especially detested is the Americans' attitude towards the local population.  <P>Over the years the neglect of the coastal province by the central government has not helped in the process of alienation and marginalisation. The fact that the Kenyan regime, one of the most corrupt on the continent, has close relations with Israel, has not helped.  <P>Many people told me that the existence of several Israeli hotels in Mombasa was a provocation, with their high security fences and policy of not employing local people. However, the most volatile ingredient in the cocktail is the changing nature of Islam itself. Local institutions that used to produce the core of Islamic leaders have long ceased to exist. Most imams in Kenya today are now graduates of universities in Saudi Arabia, Libya, Sudan and Egypt.  <P>The result is the emergence of a brand of Islam dramatically different from the traditional one. The new community-based faith being propagated is modernistic in outlook, highly politicised and extremely confrontational.  <P>Mombasa has always had strong links with the rest of the Muslim world, particularly the Arabian peninsula. But the arrival of satellite technology, combined with the impact of migrant workers returning from the Middle East, has helped spawn a new world view.  <P>Most households in Mombasa - where substantial numbers are of Arab ancestry and understand Arabic - are keen followers of events through the al-Jazeera satellite channel. The effect has been to focus discussion on the Palestinian issue above most others.  <P>The activities of the American intelligence services following the Nairobi bombing in August 1998 and September 11 have also greatly contributed towards the pervasive anti-American and anti-western feelings. People have been infuriated by the habit of CIA and FBI agents, accompanied by Kenyan intelligence officers, of barging into people's homes and searching them. To date, the whereabouts of at least 20 people arrested by the intelligence services remain a mystery.  <P>Unfortunately, Mombasa will not be the last lost paradise. The cocktail of local grievances, doctrinaire Islam, insensitive western attitudes and the festering wound of Palestine is too intoxicating, too seductive for any Muslim people to ignore. Add the notion of suicide bombing and paradise and you really have a war on your hands.  <P><b>&#183;</b> <a href=\"mailto:fuad@q-news.com\">Fuad Nahdi</a> is publisher of Q-News, the Muslim magazine."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/29/kenya.terrorismandtravel1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/nov/29/kenya.terrorismandtravel1","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"George Monbiot: The covert biotech war","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-19T02:32:33Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"science/2002/nov/19/gm.food","fields":{"body":"<p>The president of Zambia is wrong. Genetically modified food is not, as far as we know, \"poison\". While adequate safety tests have still to be conducted, there is as yet no compelling evidence that it is any worse for human health than conventional food. Given the choice with which the people of Zambia are now faced - starvation and eating GM - I would eat GM. </p><p>The real problem with engineered crops, as this column has been pointing out for several years, is that they permit the big biotech companies to place a padlock on the food chain. By patenting the genes and all the technologies associated with them, the corporations are manoeuvring themselves into a position from which they can exercise complete control over what we eat. This has devastating implications for food security in poorer countries.  </p><p>This is the reason why these crops have been resisted so keenly by campaigners. The biotech companies have been experimenting with new means of overcoming their resistance.  </p><p>Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi, all of which are suffering from the current famine, have been told by the US international development agency, USAID, that there is no option but to make use of GM crops from the United States. This is simply untrue. Between now and March, the region will need up to 2m tonnes of emergency food aid in the form of grain. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation says that there are 1.16m tonnes of exportable maize in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa. Europe, Brazil, India and China have surpluses and stockpiles running into many tens of millions of tonnes. Even in the US, more than 50% of the harvest has been kept GM-free. All the starving people in southern Africa, Ethiopia and the world's other hungry regions could be fed without the use of a single genetically modified grain.  </p><p>But the US is unique among major donors in that it gives its aid in kind, rather than in cash. The others pay the world food programme, which then buys supplies as locally as possible. This is cheaper and better for local economies. USAID, by contrast, insists on sending, where possible, only its own grain. As its website boasts, \"the principal beneficiary of America's foreign assistance programs has always been the United States. Close to 80% of the USAID contracts and grants go directly to American firms. Foreign assistance programs have helped create major markets for agricultural goods, created new markets for American industrial exports and meant hundreds of thousands of jobs for Americans\".  </p><p>America's food aid programme provides a massive hidden subsidy to its farmers. But, as a recent report by Greenpeace shows, they are not the only beneficiaries. One of USAID's stated objectives is to \"integrate GM into local food systems\". Earlier this year, it launched a $100m programme for bringing biotechnology to developing countries. USAID's \"training\" and \"awareness raising\" programmes will, its website reveals, provide companies such as \"Syngenta, Pioneer Hi-Bred and Monsanto\" with opportunities for \"technology transfer\" into the poor world. Monsanto, in turn, provides financial support for USAID. The famine will permit USAID to accelerate this strategy. It knows that some of the grain it exports to southern Africa will be planted by farmers for next year's harvest. Once contamination is widespread, the governments of those nations will no longer be able to sustain a ban on the technology.  </p><p>All that stands in the way of these plans is the resistance of local people and the protests of environment groups. For the past few years, Monsanto has been working on that.  </p><p> Six months ago, this column revealed that a fake citizen called Mary Murphy had been bombarding internet listservers with messages denouncing the scientists and environmentalists who were critical of GM crops. The computer from which some of these messages were sent belongs to a public relations company called Bivings, which works for Monsanto. The boss of Bivings wrote to the Guardian, fiercely denying that his company had been running covert campaigns. His head of online PR, however, admitted to the BBC's Newsnight that one of the messages came from someone \"working for Bivings\" or \"clients using our services\". But Bivings denies any knowledge of the use of its computer for such a campaign.  </p><p>This admission prompted the researcher Jonathan Matthews, who first uncovered the story, to take another look at some of the emails which had attracted his attention. He had become particularly interested in a series of vituperative messages sent to the most prominent biotech listservers on the net, by someone called Andura Smetacek. Smetacek first began writing in 2000. She or he repeatedly accused the critics of GM of terrorism. When one of her letters, asserting that Greenpeace was deliberately spreading unfounded fears about GM foods in order to further its own financial interests, was reprinted in the Glasgow Herald, Greenpeace successfully sued the paper for libel.  </p><p>Smetacek claimed, in different messages, first to live in London, then in New York. Jonathan Matthews checked every available public record and found that no person of that name appeared to exist in either city. But last month his techie friends discovered something interesting. Three of these messages, including the first one Smetacek sent, arrived with the internet protocol address 199.89.234.124. This is the address assigned to the server gatekeeper2.monsanto.com. It belongs to the Monsanto corporation.  </p><p>In 1999, after the company nearly collapsed as a result of its disastrous attempt to thrust GM food into the European market, Monsanto's communications director, Philip Angell, explained to the Wall Street Journal: \"Maybe we weren't aggressive enough... When you fight a forest fire, sometimes you have to light another fire.\" The company identified the internet as the medium which had helped protest to \"mushroom\".  </p><p>At the end of last year, Jay Byrne, formerly the company's director of internet outreach, explained to a number of other firms the tactics he had used at Monsanto. He showed how, before he got to work, the top GM sites listed by an internet search engine were all critical of the technology. Following his intervention, the top sites were all supportive ones (four of them established by Monsanto's PR firm Bivings). He told them to \"think of the internet as a weapon on the table. Either you pick it up or your competitor does, but somebody is going to get killed\".   </p><p>While he was working for Monsanto, Byrne told the internet newsletter Wow that he \"spends his time and effort participating\" in web discussions about biotech. He singled out the site AgBioWorld, where he \"ensures his company gets proper play\". AgBioWorld is the site on which Smetacek launched her campaign.  </p><p>The biotech companies know that they will never conquer new markets while activists are able to expose the way their operations damage food security and consumer choice. While working with USAID to open new territory, they also appear to have been fighting covert campaigns against their critics. Their products may not be poisonous, but can we say the same of their techniques?  </p><p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\"TARGET=\"_NEW\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/nov/19/gm.food","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/science/2002/nov/19/gm.food","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Simon Caulkin: Time for a recipe that works","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-17T01:30:17Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2002/nov/17/madeleinebunting.theobserver","fields":{"body":"<p>When foreign visitors ask for British food, what do you suggest? OK - breakfast, fish and chips, steak and kidney pie, but then what? Balti, sweet and sour pork? 'Modern British'? </p><p>Alas, all too often 'Modern British' isn't actually British at all, but a fusion (to put it politely) of tastes and ingredients from everywhere but Britain, and this neatly sums up the overall point: British food suffers from an identity crisis. It may have improved in parts, but it still lacks roots, depth or unifying themes. So there are no good cheap restaurants (except ethnic ones, which do have a tradition to work to), no regional identity and vanishing butchers, bakers and fishmongers.  </p><p>British food is supermarket food, the same all year round in restaurants and high streets all over the land. Either asparagus from Peru, dwarf beans from Kenya and basil from Israel, or British battery chicken and spuds. All mock fur coat and plastic knickers, you might say.  </p><p>In all this, British food bears a strong resemblance to British management. Let me explain. As with food, British management, in contrast to that of our French, German and American counterparts, has no coherent philosophy of its own. Because of the lack of a sustaining discipline, again like food, it is vulnerable to imported fads and fashions, unhealthily and inappropriately dependent on US influences (the more dangerous for being unconscious), and addicted to consultancy, the equivalent of management fast food.  </p><p>Not surprisingly, then, all too often British management ends up as a jumble of inconsistent and competing ingredients - a little just-in-time here, a dash of business process re-engineering there, masses of indigestible IT acronyms - which together deliver little nourishment. Supply chains are weak and error-prone, customers undemanding. There are a few well-performing clusters (oil, pharmaceuticals and perhaps retail) amid a sea of mediocrity. Overall, as in restaurants, service is poor and quality bears little relationship to price.  </p><p>Perhaps the most important quality that management shares with food is   that in the UK both are above all a class thing. Here is a crucial difference with other cultures. In Germany, France and the US, management is a function and a process. In the UK it is a status, which puts heavy, if unspoken, emphasis on hierarchy and is a powerful reason why British managers find it so difficult to spread decision-making to the lower orders.  </p><p>In the US, hierarchical status in general is much less important than elsewhere (there are of course huge inequalities, but they are defined in terms of money, which anyone can and does aspire to).  </p><p>Germany and France, on the other hand, appear rigidly hierarchical to an Anglo-Saxon eye, but theirs is a single hierarchy based on educational qualification (and much higher levels of qualification at that), rather than the insidious class-based double hierarchy - officers versus men, gentlemen versus players - separated by the impermeable glass ceiling of management of the UK.  </p><p>The consequences of these differences are profound. Everywhere else, management is, by and large, meritocratic, accessible to those with the right professional qualifications. What's more, since management is a function rather than a badge of status, decision-making is depoliticised and can be distributed around the hierarchy. Highly qualified German craftsmen, for instance, have an importance in the day-to-day running of German factories that their British colleagues could only dream about.  </p><p>Keith Grint, who researches and teaches leadership at Oxford's Said Business School, makes some telling points about these differing attitudes to hierarchy. In the Second World War, he points out, the stereotype was that German soldiers excelled in robotic discipline but were finally out-thought by the flexible, decentralised British and their allies.  </p><p>In fact, this is the complete opposite of the truth. 'Most Allied soldiers were told precisely what to do, were allowed little initiative and were led from the front by officers only too aware of what would happen if no one was there to show them where to go,' he writes. The Germans   knew this, 'hence &#91;their&#93; penchant for killing Allied officers because the easiest way to disable an Allied advance was to make it leaderless'. In the end, superior German organisation around flexible, decentralised groups was nullified only by greater Allied firepower and Hitler's increasingly erratic intervention in military decisions.  </p><p>Of course, business is different from war, but the parallels are clear. In uncertain times, of which the present is one, trying to control events by top-down management processes (something we're no good at anyway) is a lost cause. Something else is needed.  </p><p>Bearing that in mind, what would a unique, distinctively British organisational style for the twenty-first century look like? Well, 'modern British' management would perhaps take three cues from a new brigade of talented young British chefs painfully pushing their way through to the top of their craft. It would:  </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Share their impatience with the mediocre past and their determination to compete on their own terms and with their own talents.  </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Stop pretentiously imitating foreign fashions and resolve to build strengths with local ingredients. There's nothing wrong with British workers, designers or professionals, just as there's nothing wrong with British raw materials. It's the way this country uses them that's pitiful.  </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Concentrate on the basics. It's otiose to pretend that UK industry can compete in the Rolls-Royce categories if it can't   do Volkswagens or Vauxhalls. We don't have the skills to support a technology-centric model of management, any more than we can support more than a couple of three-star restaurants.  </p><p>Besides, as this column has argued before, concentrating on the basics is a surprisingly good winning strategy, obliging companies to focus on customers, suppliers and their own people. In particular, because people are critical to improvement, it forces them to break the management class barrier and put decision-making back where it belongs, with the work.  </p><p>As a small but growing number of role models prove, nimble, people-centred organisations where leadership is decentralised can punch far above their technological weight. This is what British management should aim at: a recipe that works, and thus can be said to renew the thread of real pragmatism - practical, evidence-based - that has somewhere got lost since the Industrial Revolution.  </p><p>Nothing fancy - but fancy is usually overrated, as it is in food.  </p><p><a href=\"mailto:simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/nov/17/madeleinebunting.theobserver","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2002/nov/17/madeleinebunting.theobserver","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Truth is another country","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-16T01:08:38Z","sectionId":"books","id":"books/2002/nov/16/fiction.society","fields":{"body":"<p>For much of my life, I have worked on frontiers. Night, fog, armed guards, tension. Walk just a few paces down the snow-covered Friedrichstrasse in Berlin, through a musty East German checkpoint, and you move from a world called west to a world called east. Nothing changes and everything changes. Or a sandbagged border post between Milosevic's Serbia and liberated Kosovo: fresh-faced Canadian soldiers pass you tenderly from one darkness to another. But also - and sometimes almost as tense - the frontiers between politics and culture, between continental Europe and the Anglosphere, between academia and journalism, left and right, history and reportage. </p><p>I like crossing frontiers. So much is revealed at them. And thinking about \"witness literature\", I want to explore the frontier between the literature of fact and the literature of fiction. I deliberately use the less familiar \"literature of fact\", rather than that lumpen term from a publisher's catalogue, \"non-fiction\". \"Literature of fact\": the phrase is beautiful, and contains the key word - fact. But first, what of its other half, that large word \"literature\"?  </p><p>It seems to me self-evident that these adjacent territories of fact and fiction both belong to literature, as France and Germany both belong to Europe. \"Literature\" is often taken to mean invented worlds. The 20th century sustained the 19th's romantic privileging of the creative imagination. For 100 years, the Nobel prize for literature was mainly, though not exclusively, awarded to novelists and poets. But who could possibly argue that the works of Thucydides, Macaulay and Nietzsche, that George Orwell's  Homage to Catalonia and VS Naipaul's  Among the Believers , are not literature? Wherever the boundary of literature lies, it is not here.  </p><p>The frontier between the literature of fact and the literature of fiction is open, unmarked. Some very fine writers stray across it quite casually, as one does when travelling in the Masai Mara - no border posts, same shrubland, same dust, same lions, but suddenly you are in Tanzania,    not Kenya. These frontier crossings come in many forms. In the reportage of that master traveler Ryzsard Kapuscinski, we find haunting claims that would certainly not survive the attentions of a fact-checker at an American magazine. (I open his  Shah of Shahs at random, and read: \"The Iranian Shiites have been living underground, in the catacombs, for 800 years.\") With Kapuscinski, we keep crossing from the Kenya of fact to the Tanzania of fiction, and back again, but the transition is nowhere explicitly signalled.  </p><p>Paul Theroux's travel book  The Great Railway Bazaar , which is full of amusing incidents and wonderfully entertaining dialogue, concludes with an elaborate plea for its own strict, reportorial accuracy. He describes in detail the four thick notebooks in which he wrote things down as they happened, \"remembering to put it all in the past tense\". On this railway trip through Asia, he writes, he had learned \"that the difference between travel writing and fiction is the difference between recording what the eye sees and discovering what the imagination knows. Fiction is pure joy - how sad that I could not reinvent the trip as fiction.\" At which I found myself thinking, \"Well, you did, you did.\" Perhaps I am wrong, but even the production of four weather-stained notebooks containing words identical to those on the printed page would not dissuade me, for the invention can come at the moment of recording.  </p><p>The historian Simon Schama begins his stimulating and avowedly experimental  Dead Certainties (Unwarranted Speculations) with a compelling eyewitness account of the Battle of Quebec by a soldier who fought in it. At the end of the book, Schama reveals that this account was fiction, \"constructed from a number of contemporary documents\". So you were in Tanzania after all. Schama suggests that history as storytelling, as literature, must reclaim the ground it has lost to history as science, or pseudoscience. I entirely agree; but from this particular literary device it is not a long step to the postmodernist conclusion that any historian's \"story\" is as good as any other's.  </p><p>Sometimes the frontier transgression    comes not in the text itself, but in the context established by the writer. According to the biography of Jerzy Kosinski by James Park Sloan, Elie Wiesel was initially lukewarm towards Kosinski's novel  The Painted Bird , which tells of a Jewish child in hiding alone during the war in a Polish village, thrown into a slurry pit by anti-semitic Polish peasants, and struck dumb by the experience. Then Wiesel gathered from Kosinski himself that the book was closely based on Kosinski's own childhood experience, and so he hailed it as a \"chronicle\" and \"a poignant first-person account\". The novel was celebrated as a \"testament\", a work of witness. Later, it turned out that Kosinski was never in hiding alone, thrown into a slurry pit, or struck dumb. The work was discredited on the very grounds that had established it. Kosinski's self-justification was interesting for our purpose. \"I aim at truth, not facts,\" said the novelist, \"and I'm old enough to know the difference.\"  </p><p>Now I want to mount a defence of this frontier, so open, ill-marked, often transgressed; a difficult defence, against the spirit of the times (\"Who cares? It's all entertainment anyway\"), yet one that seems to me of the first importance precisely when it comes to the moral and artistic quality of witness.  </p><p>Of course Kosinski had a point. Just as literature extends both sides of this frontier, so does truth. Truth is the other continent to which the states of fact and fiction equally belong. \"Ah,\" you may say, \"but these are two different kinds of truth.\" Yet that is exactly what needs to be examined, for in saying that both belong to literature we are suggesting - and I think rightly - that in many ways it is actually the same kind of truth.   </p><p>Nor shall we naively suppose that \"witness\" can be found only on one side of the line. \"You who harmed an ordinary man . . .\" writes Czeslaw Milosz, in one of his most famous poems, \"do not feel safe. The poet remembers./You may kill him - another will be born./Deeds and words shall be recorded.\" The poet remembers:  Poeta pami, eta ! Poems and novels are an essential part of the literature of witness. But I do suggest that any meaningful notion of witness depends on having a clear delineation of this frontier, and knowing which side you are supposed to be on at any one time. Ian McEwan's novel  Atonement imagines a novelist who tries at the end of her life to atone for a terrible thing she did as a child by telling the truth about it. But since she does so in a novel, no one can know what is invented and what real. She cannot atone, because she is God in this invented world.  </p><p>Words like \"witness\", \"testimony\", \"evidence\", and, of course, \"fact\" have their sober offices in a court of law. And witnesses in literature, as in law, often testify to a particular kind of fact: the fact as something someone has done, often to someone else. In 16th- and 17th-century English, the most common meaning of the word \"fact\" was \"an evil deed or crime\". \"He is . . . hanged,\" wrote a 16th-century authority, \"neere the place where the fact was committed.\" (The usage survives in the English phrase \"accessory after the fact\". In German,  Tatsache means fact and  Tatort , scene of the crime.) When we say \"witness literature\" we think first of witnesses to those \"facts\" that are committed by human beings on other human beings, whether in war, apartheid, holocaust or gulag.  </p><p>Now in defending this line, we must start by conceding much to those who would blithely stroll across it. For a start, all historians, journalists and lawyers know that witnesses are wildly unreliable. They forget, lie, exaggerate, get confused. That's why, so biblical scholars tell us, the Bible reflects the Jewish law of multiple witness. And Jesus chose 12 witnesses to record his acts. But (as this example suggests) even multiple corroboration achieves only a very rough approximation   to the original reality. I have spent some time in recent years talking to Serb and Albanian witnesses to atrocities in Kosovo. Turning from Serb to Albanian, and back again, I have often wanted to say to them what Chaim Weizmann's father, a famous village peacemaker, reportedly used to exclaim after hearing one side of an argument: \"From what you tell me, I can see that you are entirely in the wrong. Now I shall hear the other side; perhaps you are in the right after all.\"  </p><p>Moreover, the evidential basis on which history is written is often extraordinarily thin. Sometimes, we have only one witness. During the Velvet Revolution in Prague, in 1989, crucial decisions were taken by a group around V&#225;clav Havel, meeting in a curious glass-walled room in the subterranean Magic Lantern theatre. Most of the time, I was the only outsider present, and certainly the only one with a notebook open, trying to   record what was being said. I remember thinking: if I don't write this down, nobody will. It will be lost for ever, as most of the past is, like bathwater down the drain. But what a fragile foundation on which to write history.  </p><p>Of course, others who were there will add their recollections. But what use are recollections? The problem with memory is at the heart of the problem with witness. When I set out some years ago to explore my Stasi file, I thought: \"This is the perfect way to test the credibility of secret police files. After all, if I know anything at all, I know what I myself did and said.\" But as I read the file, talked to the people who had informed on me and the secret police officers who had spied on me, I found that I didn't really know even that. Or rather, what I thought I knew kept changing with every new revelation. We don't simply forget; we re-remember. Memory is a rewritable CD that is con stantly being rewritten. And rewritten in a particular way: one that both makes sense of the story to us and makes it more comfortable for us. Isn't it curious how, if two people separately describe to you an argument between them, both seem to have won?  </p><p>Philosophers have long been on to this in their different ways. Thomas Hobbes wrote that \"imagination and memory are but one thing\". One of Nietzsche's deepest apothegms reads: \"'I did that,' says my memory. 'I can't have done that,' says my pride, and remains adamant. Finally, memory gives way.\" Schopenhauer ascribed it to vanity rather than pride. More recently, the neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga has suggested, after studying patients whose left and right brain hemispheres are disconnected, that human beings have what he labels \"the interpreter\" located specifically in the left brain, whose job it is to string together   our experiences into narratives that seem to make sense. In short, we all have a novelist in our heads. A novelist called Memory ceaselessly redrafting the short story we call \"My Life\".  </p><p>Yet that is only half the ground we defenders of the line must concede, the better to advance. Suppose for a moment that there was no involuntary exercise of the creative imagination through memory. Suppose we had a perfect, impartial, scientific record of what really happened. (With the new technology of video cameras we can get closer to it than ever before, though with only two of the four senses deployed by a human witness. Cameras cannot smell or touch.) Even then, we would still have almost nothing - and much too much. To study five years of the French Revolution in just one corner of Paris you would have to sit for five years in front of a screen.  </p><p>To create the literature of fact, we have to work like novelists in many ways. We select. We cast light on this object, shadow on that. We imagine. We imagine what it is like to be that old Albanian woman weeping over the body of her murdered son, or what it was like to be a 14th-century French serf. No good history or reportage was ever written without a large imaginative sympathy with the people you are writing about. Our characters are real people; but we shape them like characters, using our own interpretation of their personalities. Then we talk of \"Michelet's Napoleon\", \"Taine's Napoleon\", and \"Carlyle's Napoleon\", for each Napoleon is in some important sense the author's creation.  </p><p>The property of deliberate imagining is certainly not confined to the Tanzania of fiction. Imagination is the sun that illuminates both countries. But this leads us into temptation. A voice in your ear whispers, \"You know that Kenyan in the slouch hat really did say that awfully funny thing you think he almost said. Just write it down. No one will ever know. And look, just across the frontier there is that gorgeous flower - the one missing novelistic detail that will bring the whole story alive. Pop across and pick it. No one will notice.\" I know this voice. I have heard it. But if we claim to write the literature of fact, it must be resisted.  </p><p>Why? For moral reasons, above all. Words written about the real world have consequences in the real world. If, in my book  The File , I had identified as a Stasi informer someone who was not, in fact, a Stasi informer - and I nearly did - that man could have found his life ruined. Friends would have shunned him, he would probably have lost his job - and worse. (At least one person exposed as a Stasi informer committed suicide.) On a larger scale, the Balkan wars of the last decade have been fuelled by bad history, written by all sides. As the historian Eric Hobsbawm observes: \"The sentences typed on apparently innocuous keyboards may be sentences of death.\" There is also a moral obligation to the victims, whether living or dead. How would we feel - how would the survivors feel - if we learned that events described in Primo Levi's  If This Is a Man had been deliberately invented, or ornamented?  </p><p>These moral reasons are sufficient; but there are artistic ones too. Writers often cross this frontier because they think their work will be enhanced as a result. Reportage or history will become literature. Paragraph for paragraph, that may be true. But as a whole, the work is diminished.  </p><p>We also need to ask \"how?\"   (often an even more difficult question than \"why?\"). How does one determine when this frontier has been crossed, given everything I have said about the unreliability of witnesses, the involuntary creativity of memory and the necessity of deliberate imagining? A simplistic, 19th-century positivist answer about scientific truth won't do. For the truth achieved by the literature of fact is in many ways the same as that achieved by the literature of fiction. If we are convinced that human beings might have acted, thought or felt in this way, it is in large measure as a result of the writer's art and imagination.  </p><p>I would suggest that, as well as satisfying all the truth tests that apply to fiction, the literature of fact must pass two further, special truth tests: those of \"facticity\" and of veracity. First, facticity. Are those things in the text that claim to be facts actually facts, or are they merely, to use Norman Mailer's vivid coinage, factoid? Dates, places, events, quotations. Did the informer identified in my Stasi file with the incongruous code-name \"Smith\" actually sign a formal undertaking to work for the secret police as an \"unofficial collaborator\" or did he not? Everything else - causes, motives, consequences - is, strictly speaking, speculation; this is fact. (As a matter of fact, I know \"Smith\" did sign, because I have studied the original document.) Many alleged facts can be externally verified. The discipline of history and the craft of reporting have developed rules, procedures, specialist skills for testing evidence. Some even merit the label \"scientific\". (An analysis of the ink used in \"Smith's\" pledge, for example.) To pass   this basic test of facticity does not make a text true, but to fail does make it untrue.  </p><p>Yet much of the time, especially with \"witness literature\", the witness is alone at the scene he or she describes. Alone with his or her eyes, conscience and imagination. If we find witnesses accurate on things we know, we are more likely to believe them on things we don't; but sometimes, there is little that we can know or check. What test works here? The best I can come up with is the quite unscientific litmus of veracity. Do we feel, as we read the text, that the writer is making whatOrwell, in praising Henry Miller, called \"a definite attempt to get at real facts\"?  </p><p>For me, the model of such veracity is Orwell's own  Homage to Catalonia . Actually, Orwell got some of his externally verifiable facts wrong - not least because most of his notes were stolen during a secret police search of his hotel room in Barcelona. But we never for a moment doubt that he is trying to tell it exactly as it was. And when we reach his plea of veracity at the end of the book, it is the very opposite of Theroux's. Orwell writes, in that wonderfully plain, conversational style that he worked so hard to achieve, \"In case I have not said this somewhere earlier in the book I will say it now: beware of my partisanship, my mistakes of fact, and the distortion inevitably caused by my having seen only one corner of events.\" In effect, he says, \"Don't believe me!\" - and so we believe him.  </p><p>Veracity is revealed in tone, style, voice. It takes us back to the artistic reasons for defending this line. You can often tell just from internal, stylistic evidence when a writer has strayed. Take a now notorious    example: the book published in 1995 as  Bruchst&#252;cke  (in English,  Fragments ) by Binjamin Wilkomirski, which purported to be the memories of a man who survived the Nazi death camps as a Polish Jewish child. It is now established beyond reasonable doubt that the author was a Swiss musician of troubled past and disturbed mind, originally called Bruno Grosjean, who had never been near a Nazi death camp - but had imagined himself into that past, that other self. Reading  Fragments now, one is amazed that it could ever have been hailed as it was. The wooden irony (\"Majdanek is no playground\"), the hackneyed images (silences broken by the sound of cracking skulls), the crude, hectoring melodrama (his father squashed against the wall by a transporter, dead women with rats crawling on their stomachs). Material which,   once you know it is fraudulent, is truly obscene. But even before one knew that, all the aesthetic alarms should have sounded. For every page has the authentic ring of falsehood.  </p><p>Compare this with the great books of true witness. Of course there are large variations in tone and style between these works. Many nonetheless have a certain voice in common: one of pained, sober, yet often ironical or even sarcastic veracity, which speaks from the very first line. Take, for example, and contrast with Wilkomirski, the first line of Levi's  If This Is a Man : \"It was my good fortune to be deported to Auschwitz only in 1944, that is, after the German government had decided, owing to the growing scarcity of labour, to lengthen the average life-span of the prisoners destined for elimination; it conceded noticeable improvements in the camp routine and temporarily suspended killings at the whim of individuals.\" How could we not believe this?  </p><p>The facts need not always be ugly.  </p><p>\"I will bring you,\" writes the English poet Craig Raine, \"the beauty of facts.\" It is, no doubt, a rather Anglo-Saxon sentiment. Yet facts, like artifacts, can be beautiful. On a white shelf at my home in Oxford, I have two objects. One is a rounded natural stone, some three inches high, of a delicate gray colour tinged with a very pale pink, moulded into contours by the cold sea washing across a pebble beach on the north-easternmost tip of mainland Britain, at the Duncansby Stacks, where I picked it up during a contented afternoon spent with my family. The other is a jagged piece of the Berlin Wall, made of a gritty composite barely deserving the name of stone, with a patch of garish graffiti on one side. They sit there, the rough and the smooth, the unnatural and the natural, facing each other, rather brightly lit on the white shelf - a stone poem for the literature of fact.  </p><p>It may seem a grave limitation for any writer to leave the facts as facts, but self-limitation is a key to art. On this frontier we should stand.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/nov/16/fiction.society","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2002/nov/16/fiction.society","sectionName":"Books"},{"webTitle":"IT is Africa's future","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-14T02:07:21Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2002/nov/14/comment.onlinesupplement","fields":{"body":"<p>People are comfortable with stereotypes. Say \"Africa\" and most Britons picture disaster, famine, refugees, and poverty. In a survey of attitudes commissioned by the Voluntary Service Organisation (VSO), published in January, 80% of Britons said those words sprang first to mind. </p><p>Aid to the developing world means western financial and volunteer support to tackle food shortages, dirty  water, poor sanitation, and the ravages of diseases usually unknown in the western world. Or does it? </p><p>Yes, such aid is vital in many areas. But the easy association of a constant Live Aid state of disaster with the entire continent is a shockingly one-dimensional view of Africa. To begin with, Africa is incredibly diverse in its countries, economies, cultures, capabilities and challenges - a fact that seems obvious when you remember that the continent takes in nations as varied as Egypt and South Africa, Mozambique and Uganda, Morocco and Kenya. </p><p>Africa also has sophisticated cities, diverse populations across several social classes, and a range of developing industries - many in the technology sector. Internet and PC penetration levels may still be extremely low compared to the west or much of Asia. But Tunisia, South Africa, Egypt, Algeria and Zimbabwe all featured as \"dynamic adopter\" countries in the United Nations' technology achievement index last year - countries that are \"dynamic in the use of new technologies\", according to the UN's Human Development Report 2001.</p><p> When Wired magazine    produced a survey of 40 \"global hubs of technological innovation\" in 2000, it included El Ghazala in Tunisia, and Gauteng in South Africa. In 1999, about 30% of South Africa's exports fell into the category of medium to high technology goods. In Tunisia, the figure was 20%, in Zimbabwe, 12%, and Egypt about 9%. </p><p>In partnership with Cambridge University, South Africa will next year launch the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (Aims), an ambitious attempt to keep the continent's young science brainpower on the continent. And don't forget that Mark Shuttleworth, the first \"afronaut\" and one of the world's first space tourists, is a youthful South African who made his fortune in the technology industry. </p><p>This is not to argue that Africa is well on its way to having the kind of casual affluence most of the western world accepts as its norm. Even in the most developed of African countries, South Africa, more than 7m people live without clean water or any form of sanitation. Famine threatens parts of the Eastern Cape, while regions of the rest of southern Africa, as well as Ethiopia, are facing the iron grip of starvation. </p><p>In the face of such recurrent tragedy, many people feel any push to expand the role of technology is frivolous. Indeed, the world's most high-profile technologist and tech businessman, Bill Gates, has wavered on the issue. His mid-90s speeches suggested computers would have an important role to play in the expansion of developing economies. But by the late 90s he had changed tack, making huge financial contributions towards more traditional forms of aid, such as vaccines, while stating in one much-publicised speech that the developing world did not need computers. </p><p>He's wrong. The developing world itself is asking for technology hardware, software and technology expertise. Consider the profile of the VSO volunteer. One in four volunteers now has a background in information technology, business consultancy   or accounting, according to Michael Shann, VSO marketing manager. Another 6% teach maths and sciences. </p><p>Demand from the developing world for volunteers in such professions has risen300% in the past five years. And to be fair, Microsoft, along with Intel and other large and small technology companies, pumps millions into the developing world in technology aid. Many of these initiatives are aimed at giving young people computing capability. Microsoft has established numerous sports and computing centres across Africa, for example, while Intel is giving technology training to teachers so they can comfortably integrate computers into the classroom. </p><p>It's crucial to realise that technology is not incompatible with aid, as the VSO's Shann points out. The computer, satellite and internet support traditional aid programmes throughout the developing world. But even more important, they will ultimately provide the way for the developing world to support itself and create its own future.  </p><p>Comments to <strong>online.feedback@guardian.co.uk</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/nov/14/comment.onlinesupplement","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2002/nov/14/comment.onlinesupplement","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"'Text messaging is liberating'","webPublicationDate":"2002-11-07T19:01:55Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2002/nov/07/textpoetrycompetition2002.poetry","fields":{"body":"<p>The competition generated much media excitement, which I hadn't expected. Being quite a private person, I was embarrassed about the attention, although happy to have won. Having sent the text poem, I didn't think anything would come of it. I am not naturally poetic or literary, so I was surprised my entry was so popular. I didn't think it was that good, so I hadn't even saved a copy. </p><p>How I was portrayed in some articles was irritating. I was made out to be a bumbling, lazy, dim \"stoodent\". This did me no favours among my friends, but my ego was only dented temporarily!   </p><p>Shortly after my win, I did a few interviews for the BBC. My poem was read on the World Service by a woman with a wonderful, lilting Caribbean accent, and it was then that I thought it sounded quite cool. That reading gave it an international context, which I liked, because it was nice to think my African grandma might be listening. The poem even made it into Time magazine.  </p><p>I was invited to sit on a panel for the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, appeared in a documentary on modern communication, and was put on a shortlist for Poems on the Underground.  </p><p>For BBC Radio Leeds, I judged a Sunday morning   poetry contest. The trouble with Sunday morning is that it comes after Saturday night and I was suffering a severe hangover and forgot the poem.  </p><p>Because the poem was about my beloved African grandma, I used the money to visit her in Kenya. As I was a peace and development studies undergraduate, I also did some research in the field on HIV/Aids and gender. This trip was a sharp insight into what a devastating impact the pandemic is having on African communities. There were times when I looked at some of the people I met and wondered who would still be alive the next time I visited. The number of orphan-headed families in the region   where I stayed is phenomenally high. And yet people still cope and get on with their lives as best they can.  </p><p>I wrote my undergraduate dissertation based on observations made while staying in Kenya. I gained a first for my degree, then I applied and got funding to do a PhD on the HIV/Aids epidemic and gender in East Africa at the department of peace studies, University of Bradford. So, I will continue with my research on the HIV/Aids crisis for the next couple of years, and hope, I can help in some (small) way.  </p><p>After staying in Kenya, I decided to go to Tanzania to observe the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. There I heard the appalling testimonies of genocide survivors and sat inches away from modern-day Hitlers. The bravery and courage of ordinary Africans in the face of extreme adversity amazed me - especially when several of the staff on the tribunal were engaged in behaviour that could only be described as out of order.  </p><p>One of the major questions I was asked was whether text messaging really is a new force for creative communication. The poetry competition certainly proved there is a very creative element in the medium. People form their own vocabularies and ways of expressing themselves through text. There is an art to composing a good text message, be it romantic, witty, or otherwise. People seem to have become empowered to express themselves as they want to, with as much regard to grammar, semantics and form as suits them.  </p><p>Text messaging as a way of speaking to other people is liberating because it allows the \"texter\" to speak instinctively. You can say as little or as much as you want, and there is a subtlety to messaging that is different from other forms of communication. The immediacy and anticipation of a message also adds to its particular charm. </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Hetty's winning poem is at  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/textpoetry\">www.guardian.co.uk/textpoetry</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/nov/07/textpoetrycompetition2002.poetry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2002/nov/07/textpoetrycompetition2002.poetry","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Interviews with 18-year-olds","webPublicationDate":"2002-10-21T00:47:08Z","sectionId":"theguardian","id":"theguardian/2002/oct/21/features11.g2","fields":{"body":"<B>Benjamin Kawaller, USA</B><br><BR>Benjamin was born in Brooklyn, where he is in the 12th grade at Packer Collegiate Institute, a private high school. His mother is a psychiatrist, his father an economist.  <P>I turned 18 on September 30 - got my draft card. But I'm not going to war - I don't have an objection to war, but I do have an objection to what's happening now. Although I'm not sure if I know enough about it. Everybody around me is against it, so I feel I should be against it, because I generally trust them - well, I don't want to say I follow them blindly. But this Saddam Hussein guy, you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't. <P>I'm not sure how political I am, though. That's so lame, not to be political. People should know what's going on. I feel like I do - I watch the news - but this war in Iraq, it's such a complex issue.  <P>I'm a big procrastinator when it comes to work, but I'm still a good student. I'm not a huge fan of work, but I'm a fan of learning. I guess I just wish it could be easier. My favourite course is probably maths. I'm doing a writing elective, too, and I think I'd like to be a writer. But something frivolous, like an advice column.  <P>Socially... what do I do? Not bars, because the minimum age is 21. Lots of kids have fake IDs, though. I had a fake ID, but as soon as I got it I ran to my mother and said: \"Look at this cool fake ID!\" She took it off me. I was astounded. I've done a lot of pot this year - that's always a fun thing to do.  <P>I've been to Europe. I like London. But when it comes to American cities - this is so snotty to say - but every city you go to feels like, well, nice try, but the real deal is New York. Why would you live anywhere else, except for maybe Paris or London?  <P>I'm the head of my school's gay-straight alliance, so I've done some activism things. I haven't really changed the world. But I think I've changed the world of this school - people think a lot more about these issues.  <P>The only discrimination I've ever had was at summer camp when I was 11 or 12, and I probably deserved it because I was singing showy said. I did hear the word faggot a lot... but only at summer camp, so I feel like I can't really complain.  <P>I got very nostalgic this year - it's like it's the   last year of my childhood. But I'm ready to leave. I'm not the kind of person who doesn't take risks, I don't always hang back. And I know that college will be good, and I'll probably be happy anywhere I go. It's college: there'll be people there, and they'll be cool. I'm not hesitant about becoming an adult. It's cool. Though I'm not sure what the immediate benefits of being 18 are. Voting.

That's probably the biggest thing. <BR><B>Oliver Burkeman</B>   <P><B>John Mungai, Kenya</B><BR><BR>John, who graduated from high school last year, spends his days at Kangemi junction, a stinking rubbish tip on the edge of Nairobi's main highway, touting business for minibus drivers.  <P>There's a lot of talk about the election, but most people are just praying there'll be peace. The politicians are arguing between themselves, but no one is talking about what to do for the common man. The truth is, they are very wealthy men, making millions. They are all self-centred, they have no interest in Kenya's young people. We need education, but also we need jobs.  <P>I used to work as a casual labourer in a pharmacy, and I hoped I would be a pharmacist. But it costs 120,000 shillings a year (&#163;1,100) to go to college, and even if I had the grades I do not have this money. My father cannot help at all. He is a driver for someone and he is already paying to send my two brothers to school. He has no money left for me. There are some scholarships for colleges in countries like the US and the UK, but there is a lot of corruption with them. Even to apply you have to cough up a bribe.  <P>I am surviving on handouts or what I pick up here from the  matatus (minibuses). On a good day I can get 200 bob (&#163;1.80), but on a bad day I get nothing. That's working from 5am until dark. Even now, I've spent all day here and I don't have a penny in my pocket.  <P>Aids is a big problem for us. Even today I heard bad news about a young lady who is a very close friend of mine. She's very well-groomed and well-behaved and I thought one day I would make love to her. So I was very shocked to hear she is a carrier. If you want to have an affair with a woman you have got to get her tested to guarantee she's not a carrier.  <P>I read and I watch movies. I like thrillers,   films with Denzel Washington. I like football also, especially English teams like Manchester. Being a Christian is my big strength. I go to church twice a week and I pray and I have faith that things will change.<BR><B>James Astill</B>    <P><B>Brenda Whelan, Northern Ireland</B><BR><BR>Brenda, a Catholic, lives in north Belfast near an interface with a Protestant neighbourhood in the nationalist Ardoyne district. Last year's loyalist protest against the Catholic Holy Cross primary school took place a few streets away.  <P>I left school last June with six GCSEs and an NVQ in information technology and I've just started an A-level course in art and design. I've always painted and drawn, and I particularly like doing still life and modern stuff. I hope to get to Hull University to do a HND and I want to be an art teacher.  <P>I don't remember an awful lot about the Troubles, but we had to leave our house when I was about three years old, and there were shots fired at the house next door. I remember the Shankill bomb &#91;which killed an IRA bomber and nine Protestants in 1993&#93;. It was a big shock, all those innocent people killed, and then I realised I knew the bomber, Thomas Begley, who died too. He was from Ardoyne and I used to see him hanging around the shops. I was worried loyalists would do something here in retaliation.  <P>Sometimes I don't think things are much different now. My uncle and his friend were shot and badly injured by loyalists a few years ago, and during the Drumcree protest, my brother needed hospital treatment after loyalists stopped his car at a roadblock and dragged him out of it. The Holy Cross protest was horrible, and loyalist gunmen came to my school last year and smashed up teachers' cars.  <P>I used to play  camogie &#91;an Irish sport&#93; for Ardoyne Gaelic Athletic Association but now I like clubbing and going out at weekends. We mostly stick round here as you worry about being attacked because you are a Catholic from Ardoyne. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to walk into a Protestant area without being afraid. I go to church regularly and it is important to me. I have Protestant friends and they are great but some of my other Catholic friends don't want to go out with them.  <P>I watch the news on television but it is hard to take it all in. The politicians always seem to   be arguing and saying the same thing. I haven't decided who I would vote for.  <P>I think the police would be a great career but no one says anything good about them, especially Catholics. You couldn't join and live here, you'd have to move, because you and your family would get terrorised.  <P>I want to travel, maybe go to Camp America and work with kids, and then come back to north Belfast and teach art. I know people say this is a bad area but my family and all my friends are here and I don't want to move away.<BR><B>Rosie Cowan</B>    <P><B>Debora Gomes Peres, Brazil </B><BR><BR>Her father is a driver and her mother a maid. She divides her time between living with her family in the Rocinha favela in Rio and with her mother's employers in nearby Ipanema. She is at school, studying for the Brazilian equivalent of A-levels.  <P>When I think about the future I think, God, I'm going to have to really bust a gut. It's going to be difficult. I think most people around my age think that the future is lost. But you have to get used to it and work harder and harder.  <P>Living in Rio used to be good, but not any more. You don't have the freedom to go out in the street because of the violence. I think it's got a lot worse in the past year.  <P>In my school there are about 2,000 people. About 200 girls are pregnant. Lots of people in my school are already working. They don't bother about wanting to study any more. If I had one wish for the country, it would be to improve the education system.  <P>I go out once a week. Usually to a bar. But going out is expensive. I want to earn enough to have a good future. To have the spending power to eat what I want to and to wear what I want to. To have money to go to the cinema. I reckon to earn about Br$2,400 (&#163;550) a month.  <P>We live in an American culture. Everyone of my age just wants to eat in McDonald's. People are not politicised because there is no education. Everyone just wants a house and a job.  <P>I wouldn't feel that I was a success if I ended up doing what my mum does. I want something that empowers me as a person. I want to be a Portuguese teacher. <BR><B>Alex Bellos</B>   <P><B>Ivan Balashov, Russia</B><BR><BR>Ivan is from Malakhovka, 30km outside Moscow. A sculpture student, he lives with his parents and studies at a Moscow university. <P>I want to stay in Russia. Of course you can be paid more if you work in America, but I studied here, and this is where my culture, my roots and my parents are. Americans are stupid, and many people here do not like them. It is nothing to do with the cold war. It is their culture that we do not like.  <P>I do not like politics because it is a dirty field. I do not like Putin though I know lots of people who think he will do great things for Russia. I believe that if the state are bandits, then the biggest bandit of all is the president - Putin.  <P>Men aged 18 are supposed to be conscripted into the army, but generally we don't want to join up. Relations between soldiers are scary - the older ones beat the younger ones. I do not have to serve in the army as I have a skin condition - dermatitis. You can avoid conscription if you have a medical condition and I have heard that some people even pay for doctor's certificates.  <P>Sex for our generation is not a big deal. People can be promiscuous. It is as you want. I have a girlfriend and maybe one day, in about five years, I will marry her. If you want a family in Russia, you are expected to marry.   <P>Our culture in Russia is a mix of American, European and Russian. I like hip hop and jazz - a mix of the Wu Tang Clan, jazz and Radiohead. In our spare time, we go to restaurants, bars, nightclubs, play football, like kids in Europe do. We have laws against selling alcohol to young people but nobody adheres to them. I had my first beer at 13, and I am not a big fan of drink, as people who drink tend not to do anything in their lives. There are lots of drugs about, too. Heroin and cocaine used to be everywhere, but these days it is more marijuana, which my friends all smoke.<BR><B>Nick Paton Walsh</B>   <P><B>Marie Usui, Japan</B><BR><BR>Since graduating from high school, Marie has been working as a hostess to save up for a trip to Australia, where she plans to study English for six months. She lives with her father (a robot maker), her mother (a nursery nurse), her sister and her grandparents in Saitama, near Tokyo.  <P>Last week, my friends and I hired a car and then drove to Tokyo Bay. We had such a great laugh, singing, dancing and gossiping about our boyfriends. It was brilliant.  <P>Loads of boys and old men tried to chat us up but we ignored them. This was a time for mates. We carried on chatting and swimming until dawn and then drove back to my home, but once all my friends had crashed out on my floor there was no room for me so I stayed awake, filling out all the documents I need for my trip to Australia next month. It wasn't drugs that kept me awake - I don't do them - it was excitement.  <P>I've been saving up by working as a hostess. It is good money - about &#163;800 a month - but we work hard until 2am almost every night. There is no sex involved: just pouring drinks, lighting cigarettes and chatting to middle-aged men in high-paid jobs. I used to be upset if one of them touched my bum, but now I put up with it. I look at it as a burden of being born a woman.  <P>My generation doesn't believe in anything except money. They don't trust anyone. I used to be like that. My dream is to establish a company and then buy an island, which would just be for me, my family, friends and orphans. But I can only get it by hard work. I don't have much time for religious people who think they can get what they want simply by praying to God. My parents are Buddhists, but that is not for me. All I believe in are ghosts, spirits, aliens and Santa Claus.  <P>I'm really looking forward to living overseas. I prefer western music such as Britney Spears and U2 to Japanese pop music. And I like western men more than Japanese men because the latter are so indecisive. I think Japan needs to change.  <P>Women have more freedom - my mum would never have been allowed to talk like me or wear makeup like mine - but we are weak. Nobody wants to do anything by themselves. <BR><B>Jonathan Watts</B>   <P><B>Candra Dwi Prasetyo, Indonesia </B><BR><BR>The son of an oil company employee and a housewife, he used to attend a state school but after failing to get in to the senior high school of his choice, he joined the private Al Azhar 3 Islamic school in south Jakarta. <P>The most important thing in my life is my religion. If someone is not religious then they have no meaning to their life or future. Take, for example, drinking alcohol; not drinking alcohol is one of the rules of Islam and if I were to violate it, my future would be ruined. I have tried it once but never again.  <P>It does not matter if one's faith is not perfect because one can always strive to improve - by praying more often, for   instance. However, you cannot live only with religion, which is why money is probably the second most important thing for me. But money and faith have to be balanced - if you concentrate on money without prayer then your life will lose meaning, but if you only pray, you cannot live.  <P>Personally, I really want to be a professional footballer. I already run my own team outside school and whenever we play games we always do our best because there could be scouts watching from professional teams. My favourite club is Inter Milan because I like their policy of bringing people in young and training them up into much better players.  <P>The chances of that happening though are very small because I am injured. I have problems with my lungs which will be hard to cure. So as a back-up I am going to apply to the University of Indonesia to study management or Japanese. I have no idea where I will be in five years, perhaps an accountant because you get a good salary. At least I am lucky that my parents say my future is up to me, they let me make my own decisions.<BR><B>John Aglionby</B>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2002/oct/21/features11.g2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2002/oct/21/features11.g2","sectionName":"From the Guardian"},{"webTitle":"Revealed: Iraq's quest to build nuclear bomb","webPublicationDate":"2002-09-21T23:40:07Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2002/sep/22/iraq","fields":{"body":"In the days before Iraq's defeat in the 1991 Gulf war, the vast sprawl of anonymous factory buildings that makes up the Badr General Establishment was a central hub in its efforts to design and build a nuclear bomb. <P>As Iraq has admitted to the United Nations, it was here, 20 miles south of Baghdad, that the bustling teams of technicians and machinists worked on components for the gas centrifuges and molecular pumps that were intended for Iraq's enrichment cascade for the fissile material for its nuclear bomb. It was here too that Iraq's missile technicians worked on modification and production of the Scud B missiles that they hoped would carry a warhead.  <P>With Iraq's capitulation to the allied forces, Badr - like the State Enterprise for Heavy Equipment Engineering and dozens of other enterprises run under the auspices of the Ministry for Military Industrialisation - was supposed to be closed down and monitored under the UN ceasefire resolutions designed to dismantle Iraq's ability to retain, design and build weapons of mass destruction.  <P>But the scientists and managers from Badr had different orders from Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. What they have been up to goes to the heart of US and UK concern that Saddam has been trying to assemble the expertise and materials to build weapons of mass destruction, for the men from Badr turned up at a factory in Minsk in the former Soviet republic of Belarus.The Iraqi delegation that arrived at the Belstroyimpex headquarters in July 1995 was a high-powered one, travelling under the aegis of the Badr General Establishment.  <P>They carried a shopping list of high-specification machine tools, including diamond cutters, a powder-metal production line and a plasma-spray machine - all potentially components for nuclear weapons and a ballistic-missiles programme. The delegation was careful to cover its tracks, keeping the visit and the deals signed secret from the UN. Iraq went to greater lengths still to hide these purchases from the UN sanctions regime, smuggling them into Iraq via the Jordanian free port of Aqaba, and trying to hide the equipment once it reached Iraq.  <P>The Iraqi deal with Belstroyimpex was not unique. As arms inspectors and independent researchers have established in the past two years, the deal was only a small part of an intensive effort by companies and organisations linked to the Iraq's Ministry of Military Industrialisation to acquire forbidden technologies and materials from Belarus and over a dozen other countries.  <P>It is an effort, say diplomatic sources, that continued just two months ago, when Iraq's deputy Prime Minister, and Minister for Military Industrialisation, Abdul Tawab Mulla Howeish, was in Minsk to sign a new protocol authorising scientific and technical exchanges between the two states. Indeed as lately as 1998 - before their forced departure from Iraq - UN inspectors discovered machine tools delivered from Belarus at the Saddam Artillery Plant, where they found Iraqi technicians installing 14 new machines for manufacturing 75-millimetre lenses with a military use. The crates were marked 'Republic of Belarus, Vitebsk Machine Building Plant'.  <P>The Iraqi activity in Belarus is the most worrying evidence that Iraq is still pursuing a covert procurement programme . It may not be the 'smoking gun' that proves that Saddam has acquired the fissile material to build his bomb, but it is evidence that he is trying hard.  <P>Firm evidence exists that in the decade since the end of the Gulf war Saddam quickly rebuilt his secret procurement networks, casting his net from the UK to eastern Europe, South East Asia and as far as Africa, operating through a complex network of front companies and middlemen.  <P>Iraqi agents have been active in Ukraine, Russia, Romania and in the former Yugoslavia. They have been spotted in Congo, Kenya, Jordan and Syria, in Malaysia and Indonesia. It has not always been a subtle or successful effort. Indeed some analysts say privately that the chaotic and piecemeal effort of Saddam's procurement network smacks of desperation. Its persistence is what is worrying Britain and the US.  <P>And it is these procurement efforts that will provide the backbone of Tony Blair's dossier on the threat posed by Iraq when it is released this week. That dossier is likely to argue that Saddam's current efforts have strong parallels with the massive Iraqi procurement programme in the 1980s when Saddam began scouring the world to build his secret conglomeration of chemical, biological and nuclear-weapons factories.  <P>'There has been an awful lot of background noise,' said one European diplomat. 'There is a lot of Iraqi procurement effort going on. Some of it is very inconclusive. But what is worrying is the accumulating evidence of the kind of stuff they have been - and continue to be - after. That has been a constant since the end of the Gulf war. It may not amount to evidence of a bomb, or a new missile system, but it is certainly evidence that they still desperately want it.'  <P>A senior British diplomat in the region said: 'There has been concern that relations between Iraq and Ukraine and Belarus have been getting warmer over the last few months. There has been   heightened activity and people going back and forth.' He said he had seen 'reports' from a variety of sources, including spies, of arms deals between the two nations and Iraq.  <P>Among those deeply concerned about Belarus and Ukraine is Tim McCarthy, who served with the UN Special Commission on Iraq (Unscom) from 1994 to 1999 and completed 13 missions in Iraq, serving as deputy chief inspector for the missile team. Now a senior analyst at the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies in the US, he studied much of the available evidence about the Belarus connection.  <P>'My concern was high about Belarus, for a number of reasons. One of the deals that the Iraqis have done was with the Minsk Tractor Factory. Public reports have stated that civilian tractors are produced. But it also produces missile launchers for Pakistan. The real &#91;Belarussian&#93; expertise comes with the missile launchers, and that is disconcerting to say the least.' McCarthy said Belarus had drawn up numerous agreements with Iraq. 'The equipment that Belarus had agreed to give Iraq would be considered to be a very real non-proliferation problem.'  <P>Among the deals that most concerned him, however, was for a so-called plasma-spray machine used in anti-corrosion treatment of components used in nuclear weapons. 'The nuclear proliferation people were very concerned about that. We have very strong documentary evidence &#91;about the deals&#93;. It was production line stuff that would have been very hard for the Iraqis to acquire legally under the UN sanctions regime.'  <P>At the head of Iraq's secret procurement effort is Abdul Tawab Mulla Howeish. A wiry and mustachioed military officer in his late forties - who also holds the rank of Deputy Prime Minister - Howeish, has come to be one of the most important figures in Saddam's regime, inevitably visible in every photo opportunity given by Saddam to Iraq's state-controlled media.  <P>And it has been Howeish who has been most visible in recent Iraqi delegations to Belarus. It was his Ministry - under its previous head - that coordinated Iraq's massive secret procurement drive in the 1980s. The only difference, note inspectors who have been trying to unravel Iraq's new procurement programme, is that the names of the front companies - and the states prepared to deal with Iraq - have changed.  <P>One of best assessments of Iraq's procurement effort has been supplied by former US weapons inspector Scott Ritter. Despite being one of the fiercest critics of the hawkish Bush line on Iraq, Ritter has noted the way in which Iraq set up a series of front companies in Jordan, Syria, Malaysia, and other countries that acted as official buyers of banned weapons and systems, which later found their way to Iraq.  <P>'We &#91;UN weapons inspectors&#93; were following, in '97 and '98, information that held that Iraq was working very closely with the government of Syria to use Syrian procurement networks in place with Belarus, with Ukraine, with Russia. The Syrians would acquire military technology, military equipment, military hardware, in contracts between these nations and Syria, and then Syria would transfer this material to Iraq in a covert fashion. And the method of payment was Iraqi oil.'  <P>Among companies that have already been revealed as being behind attempts to procure suspicious contracts are the Al Bushair trading company and the Al Saddirah Company - both identified in private memos by UN inspectors as the intermediaries in a number of deals to acquire banned technology in Belarus in the mid-to-late 1990s.  <P>Among those who have compiled their own dossier on Iraq's new procurement networks are two American researchers, Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington, and Kelly Motz, of Iraq Watch, who published the 'Shopping for Saddam' report last year. Much of the evidence they collected was based, they say, on unpublished information collected by UN weapons inspectors detailing their suspicions about Iraq's continued efforts to hide a large-scale and covert rearmament programme.  <P>'What &#91;the research&#93; showed is that Saddam's procurement network is alive and well and has been working steadily despite the sanctions,' said Milhollin. 'There are a lot of companies out there willing to break the embargo.'  <P>Motz said: 'We are seeing everything from just some basic negotiations that probably didn't go anywhere once the firms figured out what was trying to be purchased to contracts that were actually implemented and goods that were found in Iraq by the inspectors. We have contracts for missile engine components, for guidance components for missiles. We actually found some high-end machine tools that are useful for making nuclear weapons, military goods such as &#91;conventional&#93; helicopters and aircraft which were clearly embargoed.'  <P>At about the same time that the men from the Badr General Establishment were on their way to Belarus, UN inspectors uncovered further evidence of Iraq's secret procurement efforts - gyroscopes from dismantled Russian inter-continental ballistic missiles that were smuggled into Iraq, then dumped in a river when they were found to be incompatible with their missile systems. A second shipment of 115 gyroscopes was discovered in Jordan in October 1995.  <P>What is clear is that despite consistent setbacks over the past eight years, Iraq's secret procurement effort is still active across the globe. Further evidence of this trend was supplied in the past fortnight. US Vice President Dick Cheney has added his own voice to the debate, claiming the US has intercepted efforts by Iraq to buy hundreds of highly machined aluminium tubes it says were destined for an Iraqi gas centrifuge enrichment system.  <P>'You can say many things about what Iraq is up to,' said one diplomat familiar with the material. 'You can argue about what weapons he has, if any, how many, and if they will ever work. You can argue about whether he will takes two months or 10 years to build or acquire a nuclear bomb. But what you cannot argue with is the evidence that that Saddam has set up his secret weapons procurement network once again. That is the real worry.'"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/sep/22/iraq","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/sep/22/iraq","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"It's our future","webPublicationDate":"2002-09-10T00:11:42Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2002/sep/10/schools.uk4","fields":{"body":"<p>It had been a long day. Tony Blair had been abused by Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Sam Nujoma of Namibia for being a colonialist. The environment groups, including the World Wildlife Fund, were very angry that world leaders were offering so little in aid and development to help the world's poorest. After 10 days of tough negotiating the US had been blamed for watering down the lofty aims of the biggest conference in the world, and the summit seemed to be stumbling to an unsatisfactory end. </p><p>It does not seem a great moment to ask Rhys Owain Davies, aged 17, what he thinks the future holds for people like him. Can the destruction of the environment be halted? There is not a moment of doubt. \"Yes, it can all be resolved. We can put the earth back as it was before. Anything is possible with time and effort.\"  </p><p>This is not just the simple optimism of youth; he has been watching events. \"We cannot ignore the US, and I wish they would work with us, but if they won't, we should leave them out and get on with it. The European Union, the G77 group of developing countries (about 130 of them) should work together and develop the best practices. The US will want to catch up.\"  </p><p>Rhys and three other pupils, each of whose schools had won &#163;15,000 in a WWF \"Our World\" project, had just met Tony Blair for the second time. They had gone to 10 Downing Street before the summit in June, where they had reminded him that it was their future, and that of billions of poorer children, which he was supposed to be safeguarding in Johannesburg.  </p><p>Blair was only at the summit for 14 hours and they met him towards the end of a long day that had begun at 5.30am. He was thanking the British team of negotiators who had been putting the \"plan of action\" from the earth summit together. They managed to get firm targets on getting clean water and sanitation to the poor but not on other basic services such as electricity.  </p><p>Rhys, who represented Ysgol Gyfun Llanhari, a Welsh language school near Cardiff, was with three younger children: Tim Green, aged 10, from Brixington Junior, Exmouth, Devon; Peter   Burton (11) from Ballymena Primary, Co Antrim; and Stephanie Wiseman (11), Lunnasting School, Shetland. Each of their schools had submitted prize-winning ideas to the Our World project and the four had been chosen to travel to witness the earth summit.  </p><p>Rhys's school had put on a show on a sustainability theme, involving every class in the school and 200 players. It toured local schools and brought in local societies and civic groups, including the Giant Vegetable Society. Just to show how educational these events can be, Rhys learned that the secret of growing giant carrots and pumpkins was to feed them on beer.  </p><p>The Devon school developed a sustainable trail involving solar panels and energy-saving devices. In Northern Ireland a sustainability audit of the school was followed up with the creation of an orchard, a weather station and a sensory garden. And in cool and windy Shetland the pupils were building a wind turbine and installing solar panels to supply energy to the school.  </p><p>But in Johannesburg the four had a busy schedule. More than four con ferences were going on, attracting 65,000 delegates and international media. Besides the 189 countries represented, many with negotiating teams, there were groups of \"civil society\", ranging from business leaders to landless peasants from Brazil and South Africa. Millions of people who live on less than 50p a day had no voice at the summit, but looked to heads of state to give them hope.  </p><p>Among the places the four visited was Ubuntu village, which showed off African crafts, and sustainable development projects from across the world. These illustrated what could be done if poor communities were given help applying simple technology.  </p><p>But for Peter Burton from Northern Ireland, seeing some of the very poor people will remain an enduring memory. The four with their teachers had visited a project in Ivory Park, a squatter camp on the edge of Johannesburg where country people seeking jobs have come to the city. There are no proper homes for them and few jobs, but there is no going back as desperation had driven them to move there in the first place.  </p><p>Peter borrowed a bike made from recycled parts from the UK-financed sustainability project and toured the settlement, now 80,000-strong. Most homes were small huts with brick or sometimes only wooden or plastic walls.The roofs were made of tin.  </p><p>\"It was terrible that people had to live like that,\" he said. \"There were stalls outside homes selling fruit and vegetables but very little, children of my age without any shoes and very little clothes - and people cooked what food they had in open fires in the street in very old tin cans.\"  </p><p>Rhys, who is studying geography, physics and physical education for A-level, agreed. He had done a project on poverty in Penrhys in the Rhondda Valley, and studied pictures of a squatter camp in Kariobangi, on the edge of Nairobi in Kenya. It had not prepared him for Ivory Park. \"I just did not think it was fair that people had to live like that. It was unbelievable they had to survive like that every day.\"  </p><p>And it seemed he was not alone in his analysis of how to make a start. The UK, EU, 10 other countries in Europe, Brazil, Argentina, the Caribbean nations and those in Latin America, some in Africa and all the small island states joined together in a statement and said they were determined to promote renewable energy. The earth summit plan of action was too weak and it was not good enough. They would go it alone without America. Which was exactly Rhys's idea put into practice.    </p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Paul Brown is the Guardian's environment correspondent and has been reporting on the earth summit from Johannesburg.  </p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/sep/10/schools.uk4","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2002/sep/10/schools.uk4","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Scanner to spot airline troublemakers","webPublicationDate":"2002-07-23T01:18:59Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2002/jul/23/transportintheuk.theairlineindustry","fields":{"body":"<p>Virgin Atlantic and Go are to trial a hi-tech database system which allows airline staff to identify disruptive airline passengers by scanning their passports at check-in. </p><p>The system, designed by the government-owned technology firm Qinetiq, is likely to alarm civil libertarians by creating a central database which combines blacklists of passengers kept by each individual airline.  </p><p>Go and Virgin will begin testing the system in October.

He had worked his passage out on a tramp steamer from London's East India Docks, returning third-class by train. It was the end of his first summer vacation as an Oxford undergraduate and the start of what were to become his legendary travels, recorded ever since in books of impeccable prose and peerless black-and-white photography. </p><p>\"I found two letters waiting for me,\" he says. \"One was an invitation from Ras Tafari to attend his coronation as the Emperor Haile Selassie &#91;111th and last emperor of Abyssinia - modern Ethiopia&#93;. The other was a notification from the Foreign Office that I had been appointed honorary attach&#233; to the Duke of Gloucester, who would attend the coronation as the representative of his father, King George V.\" </p><p>The invitation was personal. Thesiger's father, Wilfred, had been appointed British minister in charge of the legation at Addis Ababa in 1909. Over the next 10 years, he gave the future emperor much valued support during bloody times. Wilfred, his first son, was born in the Abyssinian capital the following year. \"It is your country,\" the newly crowned emperor later told the rangy, hawk-nosed Magdalen College student at a private audience. \"You were born here. You have lived here for half of your life. I hope you will spend many more years with us.\"  </p><p>Thesiger planned to end his days in Africa, at Maralal in northern Kenya, where he lived as part of an extended family among the Turkana and Samburu tribes for over 20 years. The death of his closest Samburu friends, Lawi and Laputa, increasing lawlessness in the region and the gradual failure of his eyesight saw him return to his flat in Chelsea in 1994. Today, at 92, he lives in a Regency retirement home in Coulsdon, Surrey, deep in Betjeman country. Haile Selassie's world, battered by Mussolini in the 1930s, was finally destroyed by the murder of the emperor. A direct descendant of King Solomon, Selassie was deposed in a pro-Soviet Marxist coup in 1974: a year later he was smothered while recovering from surgery.  </p><p>There can be few countries more alien in 2002 than the Abyssinia of 1930. To hold a hand-written letter inviting a young Englishman to the coronation of the legendary Prince Tafari is like fingering an ancient Egyptian papyrus or imperial Roman scroll, a strangely unreal experience. The man to whom this extraordinary invitation was sent is, however, not only quite real but working on his next book, a collection of his writings and photographs due to be published this October with a new introductory essay.  </p><p>Clad in venerable tweeds, and every inch the English gentleman, Thesiger might seem like an archaic figure from a distant country. He remains, though, very much a man for our times: behind the impeccable old-world manners resides a fierce anti-globalist, an environmentalist, a man of almost no possessions and an influential champion of those who live outside the boundaries of political and social convention. His early years in Addis Ababa, he says, stamped on his agnostic soul the barbaric glory and elemental values of traditional societies and instilled in him the fiercest detestation of the modern world. \"Like many\", he says, \"I regret the forces which are inexorably subur banising the &#91;world's&#93; untamed places.\"  </p><p>Thesiger, according to the travel writer Jan Morris, \"is one of the most alarming men I have ever met. An ascetic. A real, unselfconscious primitive. I feel a little silly now, having once written what I see as rather churlish reviews of some of his books. I didn't and I don't believe in primitivism as he does; the modern world has too much to offer us in terms of benevolent science, technology and medicine. Yet Thesiger has never been anything other than true to his ideals and to himself.  Arabian Sands &#91;1959&#93;, his first book is nothing less than magnificent.\" Thesiger has never courted celebrity. As Sara Wheeler, author of  Cherry, the biography of the Antarctic explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard, says, \"Thesiger dwells in a Homeric age of exploration and travel writing, an age before sponsorship and television tie-ins. He stands as a monolith against trash consumerist and trash celebrity culture.\"  </p><p>Far-flung travel and exotic homes were a stock-in-trade for his parents, even before Abyssinia. The Hon Wilfred Thesiger - horseman, big-game hunter, yachtsman, cricketer, poet, diplomat - had fought with distinction during the Boer War before taking up government posts in southern Europe, Asia Minor, Russia and the Congo. He was proud that his own generation of Thesigers included the Indian Viceroy (Frederick, Lord Chelmsford, his eldest brother), a general, an admiral, a Lord of Appeal, a High Court judge and an actor (Ernest).  </p><p>The young Wilfred was entranced by Addis Ababa. In his autobiography, The Life of My Choice (1987), he wrote of revelling in the \"pitch and intonation of voices speaking Amharic; the smell of burning cowdung that permeated the town; the packs of savage dogs that roamed the streets; an occasional corpse hanging on the gallows-tree; beggars who had lost a hand or foot for theft\". Above all, he was inspired by, and has never forgotten, the sight and sound of the emperor's armies returning after their near-total destruction of the renegade army of Negus Mikael during the revolution of 1916-17. The fighting had been entirely hand-to-hand, one of the last great pitched battles between traditional African warriors. About 26,000 died.  </p><p>\"I believe that day implanted in me a life-long craving for barbaric splendour, for savagery and colour and the throb of drums,\" says Thesiger, \"and that it gave me a lasting veneration for long-established custom and ritual, from which I would derive later a deep-seated resentment of western innovations in other lands, and a deep distaste for the drab uniformity of the modern world.\"  </p><p>The modern world caught up with Thesiger and his younger brothers: Brian, a future regular army officer who served with distinction at Anzio and in Burma during the second world war; and Dermot, who took to the law after Oxford only to be killed as a newly commissioned pilot with RAF Coastal Command in 1941.  </p><p>In 1919, their father's tour of duty had expired and the family returned to England. The boys were sent to a disciplinarian prep school, St Aubyn's in Rottingdean, East Sussex, where their exotic tales of life in Africa were taken for lies by their insular Home Counties classmates. At the beginning of their second term, the Hon Wilfred dropped dead while shaving. He was 48.  </p><p>Their mother went on to rent The Milebrook, a gabled stone house on the Stanage estate in Radnorshire. With their spaniels, who slept on their beds, the boys walked for miles up through the Radnor Forest and the Elan Valley where they delighted in watching peregrines, kites and wild geese. They shot grouse, pheasant, woodcock, duck, snipe and rabbits for the pot. Thesiger was to shoot big game and birds until 1960, when he realised that animals that had once been a threat to tribal farmers and their livestock were now in danger of extinction.  </p><p>At Eton from 1923 he was considered odd because he could not play rugger, soccer or cricket, nor did he want to. He was, though, a fine boxer (at Oxford he won three Blues), while his sheer stamina and resistance to physical pain were to become legendary. He enjoyed Eton. \"I had my own room,\" he says. \"Very small, but I could fill it with the books and pictures I loved and memories of Abyssinia.\" Oxford was even better. He was there from 1930-33, but there was one disappointment: he failed to meet his hero, Lawrence of Arabia.  </p><p>They almost met, says Thesiger, at Elsfield Manor, home of John Buchan, author of  The Thirty-Nine Steps. Lawrence, like Thesiger, was a frequent visitor. Lawrence's reputation may have been vilified for half a century or more, but Thesiger will have none of it. \"He was a great man, and I should have liked to have met him more than anyone else\", he says. A copy of Lawrence's  Seven Pillars of Wisdom is in reach of Thesiger's narrow Surrey bed, surrounded by some of those old books and pictures he loves.  </p><p>From Oxford, Thesiger - in his words, \"highly impressionable and incurably romantic\" - set out on the first of his many adventures through north Africa to Danakil country on the Abyssinian border with French Somaliland, along the Awash River, through the Aussa sultanate and to the port of Tajura, armed with rifle, binoculars, compass and camera, alert to both the savagery and beauty of the places and people he met. He joined the Sudan Political Service in 1934; his first appointment was to the remote Kutum district in Northern Darfur. He decorated his thatched hut with rugs, leather cushions, lion skins, swords, knives and animal horns. Lion cubs played on the bed. He and Guy Moore, the District Officer, were the only white people for many miles. To Thesiger, this was home from home. He was, wrote Douglas Newbold, a former colonial governor, in  The Making of Modern Sudan, \"a   brave, awkward, attractive creature\".  </p><p>It was here, too, that Thesiger fell in love with the desert, what Guy Moore liked to call \"the High Altar of God\". In The Life of My Choice he wrote, \"I was exhilarated by the sense of space, the silence, and the crisp cleanness of the sand. I felt in harmony with the past, travelling as men had travelled for untold generations across the deserts, dependent for their survival on the endurance of their camels and their own inherited skills.\" More importantly, over the next six years, Thesiger learned to love fierce desert tribespeople, as they learned to respect him - he shot lions to protect them, and learned to become a competent amateur doctor. His sense of justice was finely honed. He says he was lucky never to have attended an execution; in court cases he always hoped for mitigating circumstances.  </p><p>His belief in politicians, meanwhile, was destroyed in 1935 when the modern world intruded savagely on Abyssinia with the Italian invasion. Widespread use of poison gas assured them of victory. Brutal massacres followed. \"The Duce will have Ethiopia with or without Ethiopians,\" declared General Rodolfo Graziani, the bloodthirsty Italian governor general. Haile Selassie's plea for help to the League of Nations had been met with a stony response, particularly from the British government, which made a jubilant Mussolini laugh and gave Hitler the encouragement he needed to march across Europe without hindrance. \"Such cynicism,\" says Thesiger, \"beggars belief.\" Today he supports no political party. \"Even those who talk of spreading peace to Africa\", he says, \"are busy selling corrupt governments arms behind the scenes; this spells death and starvation for the people of innocent tribes.\"  </p><p>Evelyn Waugh, whom Thesiger had met at Haile Selassie's coronation, delighted in the Italians' behaviour. Italian rule, he wrote, \"is being attended by the spread of order and decency, education and medicine in a disgraceful place\". While admitting that he wrote well, Thesiger despised the deeply cynical Waugh who had previously used his press invitation, representing The Graphic newspaper, to Haile Selassie's coronation as an excuse to make fun of black Africans. This was anathema to Thesiger, who says, \"aesthetically, I regard white as the least attractive colour for skin\".  </p><p>During the second world war, as a member of the Sudan Defence Force, Thesiger fought against the Italians in Abyssinia under the command of Colonel Orde Wingate, the future Chindit leader. Thesiger had the satisfaction of helping drive the Italians from Abyssinia. He was awarded the DSO for capturing the Italian-occupied fort at Wagidi in 1941, taking 2,500 prisoners. He moved on to Cairo and Trans-Jordan with the Special Operations Executive. He was promoted major and made second-in-command of a newly raised Druze Legion under Colonel Gerald de Gaury.  </p><p>With British order established in Syria, Thesiger visited a deserted, wartime Petra, and mixed with Dervishes in Damascus, before heading to Cairo. He fell in with Colonel David Stirling and fought daringly and heroically behind the German and Italian lines in North Africa with the newly established SAS. Contemporary photographs reveal a cavalier-looking bunch of desperadoes in Arab head-gear and individually customised British battledress. With the defeat of Rommel's Afrika Korps in early 1943, the SAS moved to Palestine. Thesiger was intrigued to be welcomed by Arabs whose homeland was being taken from them by the British for Jewish immigrants.  </p><p>In October 1943 he left the SAS for a post as advisor to Haile Selassie in Abyssinia. This led, by the end of the war, to a post with the Desert Locusts Research Organisation, which required Thesiger to find the outbreak centres of locust swarms in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. This gave him the opportunity to cross, by camel, what the Bedu called the Empty Quarter, the uninhabitable dunes stretching between Saudi, Yemen and Oman. This deeply dangerous journey - stifling heat, a dearth of water, warring tribes on every side - led to  Arabian Sands . Although he was to fight again, for the Royalists in Yemen during the civil war of 1966-67, Thesiger the colonial officer and soldier had effectively been reborn as explorer and author.  </p><p>He went on to record the lives of the remote peoples and places of Iraq, Persia &#91;Iran&#93;, Kurdistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan and, more recently, Kenya. \"Each new book\", says his official biographer, Alexander Maitland, \"was to be a chapter closing on Wilfred's life.\" And on the world's disappearing itinerant tribes. The life of the Ma'dan, the marsh Arabs of southern Iraq, with whom he spent eight years up until the Iraqi revolution of 1958, is now little more than history: 90% of the marshes have been drained, an ancient, unique and irreplaceable way of life all but destroyed.  </p><p>He described it in The Marsh Arabs: \"The crying of geese, duck flighting in to feed, a boy's voice singing somewhere in the dark, canoes moving in procession down a waterway, the setting sun seen crimson through the smoke of burning reedbeds, narrow waterways that wound still deeper into the marshes.\" Thesiger says he would \"hate to see the area today. Homo sapiens is a young and clever creature, but not particularly wise; the species has had a phenomenal rise, but, by being so destructive, is heading for a fall.\"  </p><p>But Thesiger is no misanthrope. He adores the people he has lived and travelled with and, although a free spirit in most ways, according to Maitland, \"positively craves company\". Women, however, as Dennis Drabelle of the Washington Post, has observed \"are all but invisible in Thesiger's travels, a feature that suited him fine\". Thesiger told Drabelle that he preferred the \"ancient Greek ideal that the young male is the symbol of human beauty\". He also insisted that \"his admiration was always Platonic\". \"I don't doubt him\", says Drabelle, \"but it's hard not to draw a connection between his asexuality and the loneliness, the life sentence of apartness he often writes and speaks about.\"  </p><p>The photographs - always black and white - Thesiger has taken since the mid-1930s include many of beautiful African and Arab men, and very few of women. This is partly because women in most of the societies he has adopted are all but invisible, and partly through preference. Maitland, a model of discretion, will not be drawn on the subject of Thesiger's sexuality. He refers the inquirer back to a passage in the autobiography: \"It was the comradeship of the Bedu I travelled with that drew me back to that land year after year; two among them in particular mattered to me as few other people have mattered. A similar attachment kept me eight years in the marshes of Iraq and... kept me longer in northern Kenya &#91;from 1968 until 1994&#93;.\" These were bin Kabina and bin Ghabaisha among the Bedu, Amara bin Thuqub and Sabaiti among the marsh Arabs and Lawi Leboyare and Laputa in Kenya. All were strikingly good-looking.  </p><p>\"I have found this comradeship\", says Thesiger, \"most easily among other races than my own. Perhaps this trait could be traced back to the hurtful rejection I suffered from my contemporaries at preparatory school when I was a small boy freshly arrived from Abyssinia in an alien English world.\"  </p><p>The men he has travelled with have never been less than tough. In the late 60s, Thesiger's path crossed that of the travel writer Eric Newby and his companion, Hugh Carless, high in the Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan. They stayed overnight together, but when Thesiger saw Newby and Carless inflating air-beds, he observed, as Newby later noted in  A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush, \"you must be a couple of pansies\". \"I hardly care what I eat,\" Thesiger writes in  The Life of My Choice, \"provided it suffices, and I care not at all for wine or spirits. Sex has been of no consequence to me, and the celibacy of desert life left me untroubled. Marriage would certainly have been a crippling handicap.\"  </p><p>Maitland, who has known Thesiger since the early 60s when they travelled to Kenya together, and whose official biography is still some years away, says, \"You have to remember that Wilfred was brought up and educated in two worlds, the great sweep of Africa and the closed world of an English prep school, of Eton and Oxford. To some extent he is institutionalised yet he can fit in anywhere if he chooses to. He has always liked the old London clubs.\" As well as holding the Star of Ethiopia and DSO, Thesiger is an honorary fellow of Magdalen College. He was knighted in 1995. And, yet, he has lived for years in conditions that 99% of westerners would find intolerable for more than a day. \"Journeying at walking pace under conditions of some hardship... I was happiest when I had no communication with the outside world, when I was utterly dependent on my tribal companions. My achievement was to win their confidence.\"  </p><p>He has never been to the United States, he says, and does not want to go. He says, \"The long-term effect of US culture as it spreads to every nook and cranny in every desert and every mountain valley will be the end of mankind. Our extraordinary greed for material possessions, the ways we go about nurturing that greed, the lack of balance in our lives, and our cultural arrogance will kill us off within a century unless we learn to stop and think. It may be too late.\" The car, he believes, has done more than almost anything else to destroy traditional cultures. Where the peoples he photographed looked lean and beautiful in their nakedness or stunning local costumes, today they too are part of a global tribe that wears baseball caps, chews gum, gawps at TV and yaks into mobile phones.  </p><p>Thesiger has very few possessions. In recent years, he has given his priceless collection of 25,000 negatives to the Pitt-Rivers Museum, Oxford, and the manuscripts of his books to Eton. He owns no property. Instead there are a few exquisite personal mementoes from Africa and Arabia, shelves of books by favour- ite authors - Buchan, TE Lawrence, Doughty, Kipling - and several drawings and photographs. Among these is a snapshot taken on a Box Brownie of Ras Tafari's coronation.  </p><p>\"Wilfred,\" says Colin Thubron, fellow wanderer, author and Etonian, \"has had the man's courage to live out the boy's dream.\" \"He has never forgotten,\" says Sara Wheeler, \"what it's like to be and to think like a child. You can read his books when young and take them to the grave with you. I prize a photograph taken two years ago of my son, Wilfred, named after him, sitting on the great man's knee. Children love him. He's very grand, yet meets everyone on their level. He doesn't know how to be condescending.\"  </p><p>\"Travel and travel writing today,\" says Michael Palin, author and well-travelled television presenter, \"are like competitive sports, things to show off to your friends in gap years between school and college, daredevil stuff for chaps who want to hop backwards across the Antarctic. Thesiger has never sought publicity. He isn't very much interested in how we perceive him: what he wants is for us to know about the places, and most of all the peoples, he has seen disappearing as globalism has lived up to its name.\"  </p><p>\"It's wonderful to know that Wilfred is still active and raging against the forces of globalism,\" says Jan Morris, \"though I can't help seeing him as forever 38 years old, striding out among deserts and mountains, a remote hero, a distant figure in a far and vanishing landscape.\"    </p><p><strong>Life at a glance: </strong>Wilfred Patrick Thesiger  </p><p><strong> Born: </strong> June 3 1910, Addis Ababa, Abyssinia.  </p><p><strong> Education: </strong> 1919-23 St Aubyn's school, Rottingdean; '23-28 Eton; '29-33 Magdalen College, Oxford (honorary fellow, 1982); '33 captain, Oxford boxing team.  </p><p><strong> Employment: </strong> 1935-40 Sudan Political Service.  </p><p><strong> Military Service: </strong> 1940-45 Sudan Defence Force, Abyssinia; Special Operations Executive, Syria; SAS, Western Desert.  </p><p><strong> Some books:</strong> 1959 Arabian Sands; '64 The Marsh Arabs; '79 Desert, Marsh and Mountain; '87 The Life of my Choice; '87 Visions of a Nomad; '94 My Kenya Days; '96 The Danakil Diary; '98 Among the Mountains; '99 Crossing the Sands.  </p><p><strong> Honours: </strong> 1930 Star of Ethiopia, 3rd class; 41 DSO, '48 Founders Medal, Royal Geographical Society; '55 Lawrence of Arabia Medal, Royal Central Asian Society; '62 Livingstone Medal, Royal Scottish Geographical Society; '64 Heinemann Award;'65 Fellow, Royal Society of Literature; '95 knighted (KBE).</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview6","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2002/jun/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview6","sectionName":"Books"},{"webTitle":"Africa declares war on its invisible scourge","webPublicationDate":"2002-05-31T09:15:18Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2002/may/31/health.medicalscience","fields":{"body":"One evening last week a small column of white, four wheel drive cars passed through the villages of the Great Rift Valley in southern Ethiopia, in a chocolate smell of long-dry earth wetted by the early rains. <P>To the local people coming home from their fields of banana, teff and sugar cane, it must have looked like one more foreign aid agency on the move. But the vehicles were Ethiopian, and the man with the greatest responsibility on board was Ugandan: John Kabayo.  <P>It is not a small thing he wants. Starting here, in six months' time, Mr Kabayo hopes to see the beginning of the destruction of an animal which has held Africa back since the Bronze Age.  <P>The endeavour is so ambitious and so counterintuitive that at first hearing it is hard to comprehend: the extermination of an entire, common insect species, the tsetse fly, by poison, deceit and the release from aircraft of billions of radiation- sterilised insects. The cost and timescale are unknowable, but they certainly exceed billions of pounds and several decades.  <P>It is not only the money and the time. The job requires perfect coordination between a cold war-era nuclear agency in Vienna, sceptical donor countries - Britain is among the project's opponents - and 36 African nations, all of them poor, allstruggling with other serious illnesses such as HIV and malaria, and some in a state of armed conflict.  <P>The difficulties, and the numbers, are horrendous. So too is the cost to Africans of the disease carried by the tsetse fly: sleeping sickness in humans, nagana in livestock.  <P>Sleeping sickness is less well known in rich countries than malaria is because it is a disease of the countryside, not cities or resorts, and does not figure on tourists' list of jabs and prophylactics. It infects between 300,000 and 500,000 Africans each year, and if not treated, it is fatal. More than a thousand people die of the disease each week.  <P>Even the standard treatment for late-stage sleeping sickness, a drug based on arsenic, is so poisonous that it kills up to 10% of those who take it.  <P>\"We are not saying we're going to finish it tomorrow. What we're saying is that we have do do something,\" said Mr Kabayo, who heads Pattec, the Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign, set up by the Organisation of African Unity. \"It's not acceptable that we suffer from a disease which can be stopped. If it takes us 100 years, we are going to do it.\"  <P>Alongside sleeping sickness, tsetse has a second, perhaps more devastating effect. The parasite it carries weakens and kills humankind's essential quintet of large domestic animals - cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses - meaning that for thousands of years African farmers in a vast belt across the centre of the continent have been unable to carry out the kind of mixed farming, using draught animals to pull ploughs and fertilise fields, which gave their northern counterparts the economic advantage to conquer the world.  <P>\"There's nothing that has made its mark on this continent as much as tsetse fly,\" said Mr Kabayo. \"It's so subtle and invisible, and doesn't get in the news. But this is the reason why crop and livestock production are separate here.  <P>\"You can imagine what it has meant for the continent that you have to walk everywhere on foot, and that all farm work has to be done by hand.\"  <P>Like mosquitoes, tsetse flies feed on blood. During feeding, they can transmit and pick up parasites called trypanosomes, which attack the animal's or human's nervous system.  <P>Working area by area, Pattec's plan is to   reduce tsetse numbers by the use of millions of targets: cheap, simple rectangles of black and blue cloth stretched on stakes which fool the flies into thinking they are animals. As soon as they descend on the cloth to bite, the insects are killed by a dose of poison. At the same time, cattle in project areas will have an anti-tsetse insecticide painted on them.  <P>Once tsetse populations are reduced to 5% or less of their previous size, aircraft will release millions of male flies which have had their sperm damaged by radiation. Females will mate with the irradiated males - who will outnumber the fertile males - and conceive, but will not produce offspring. After months of such bombardment, the population should dwindle to zero.  <P>The insects themselves are not radioactive. The technique has already been used to eradicate the screwworm fly from the southern US, Mexico and central America as far south as the Panama Canal. It also eradicated tsetse flies from Zanzibar, off the coast of Tanzania, in 1997.    <P><B> Irradiated</B><BR> <P>On the outskirts of Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, the scaffolding is going up over a new tsetse fly breeding facility. Inside the existing, smaller centre, racks hold hundreds of garden sieve-like drums of insects, which feed off shallow trays of cow's blood overlaid with a porous membrane.  <P>Once sexed and graded, the flies are sent in chilled flasks to be irradiated in a lead drum containing cobalt-60, the material used for cancer radiotherapy.  <P>Ethiopia, a poor country landlocked by equally poor countries, is spending &#163;11m of its own money on the first phase of tsetse eradication near Arba Minch, together with &#163;14m of aid from abroad.  <P>The transfer of nuclear technology to Ethiopia is being mediated by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  <P>Flying over Arba Minch on an IAEA- organised trip to the continent, it was possible to see something of the Ethiopians' misfortune. On the hilltops, above the 1,600-metre cut-off point where it is too cool for the tsetse to survive, the farms   cluster in their thousands, tiny plots of marginal land wedged into every available space, even at the head of steep gullies, each farm having to support a large family. Below 1,600 metres, in the tsetse zone, the farms are fewer, and sweeps of fertile land lie uncultivated.  <P>More than 23,000 sq miles of Ethiopia's southern nationalities region - an area almost the size of Scotland - has tsetse, and until the recent control efforts began, the insect was on the increase.  <P>In the small community of Lante, farmers gathered in the shade of three old warka trees and described how they were only now beginning to recover from the tsetse's ravages in the 1990s.  <P>\"When I was rich I had 50 cattle. Forty died. Now I have six,\" said Berza Bassa, who has eight children, two wives, and 1.5 hectares of land. \"We lost our draught oxen. We lost our milking cows. After that we were poor.\"  <P>But opponents of the tsetse programme have powerful arguments on their side. They say that traps and targets, combined with drugs, can make the disease so manageable that the expense of the sterile insect technique is unjustified.  <P>They say that there is too much chaos in Africa to enable the cooperation that will be needed to stop tsetse-free areas being re-invaded. They say that the continent's game parks survive only because the tsetse keeps farmers' livestock out.  <P>Most of all, there is just too much tsetse out there - an infested area the equivalent of 37 Britains. Each sub-species of tsetse needs its own sterile insect programme, and some countries, such as Kenya and Tanzania, have five sub-species.  <P>Britain gives millions towards tsetse control and research, but does not believe that eradication could happen. \"It will not be possible to eradicate flies from the continent,\" Clare Short, the development minister, said earlier this year.  <P>With a secretariat of two in the OAU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Mr Kabayo has had little power so far to exert pressure on African governments to live up to the declarations they made when Pattec was set up, or travel the world lobbying donors.   <P>Mr Kabayo knew tsetse as a boy. Now 53, he was born into a semi-nomadic, cattle-herding family in western Uganda, and helped move the livestock from place to place, avoiding the insect.  <P>With the encouragement of his uncle, the Bishop of Uganda, he went to secondary school, ultimately gaining a PhD in biochemistry at Warwick University and doing post-doctoral work on blood at Bristol.    <P><B> Epidemic</B><BR> <P>In his homeland today, there is an epidemic of sleeping sickness on the shores of Lake Victoria. In a treatment centre at Namungawe, a collection of simple concrete boxes with beds where relatives of the sick gather outside to cook meals for their loved ones, one sufferer said his village has seen 30 cases this year.  <P>The disease begins as a fever, like malaria, with a headache and joint pain. Sufferers then begin to doze off and become confused; they may become impotent and incontinent. Without treatment, they go into a coma and die.  <P>At the treatment centre, some patients seemed normal, if subdued. Others lay awake, but unable to respond.  <P>Rose Kyega, 24, could not talk. She sat up in bed, rigid, swallowing, confused, as if she had no idea where she was. Each patient had their medical history lying on the bed, in a cheap green school jotter.  <P>Faustin Maiso, a sleeping sickness specialist from the Ugandan health ministry, said that they were grateful for aid - but until the fly itself was eradicated, they would be vulnerable.  <P>Drug resistant forms of the parasite were spreading. Western companies were reluctant to spend to research new drugs. Donors' priorities have changed.  <P>Mr Maiso said: \"Late-stage treatment costs about $100, early about $50. In Uganda the amount allocated per person for the whole year is $5. Without help, without donor support, there's hardly anything to be done.\"  <P>\"We're able to control it for as long as we have enough assistance, but once the assistance has gone, the epidemic comes up again. So as a long-term solution, why not get rid of the fly?\""},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/31/health.medicalscience","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2002/may/31/health.medicalscience","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"George Bush's global warming speech","webPublicationDate":"2002-02-14T17:56:26Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2002/feb/14/usnews.globalwarming","fields":{"body":"<p>Thank you very much for that warm welcome. It's an honour to join you all today to talk about our environment and about the prospect of dramatic progress to improve it. </p><p>Today, I'm announcing a new environmental approach that will clean our skies, bring greater health to our citizens and encourage environmentally responsible development in America and around the world. </p><p>Particularly, it's an honour to address this topic at NOAA, whose research is providing us with the answers to critical questions about our environment. And so I want to thank Connie for his hospitality and I want to thank you for yours, as well. Connie said he felt kind of like Sasha Cohen - I thought for a minute he was going to ask me to talk to his mother on his cell phone. </p><p>I also want to tell you one of my favourite moments was to go down to Crawford and turn on my NOAA radio to get the weather. I don't know whether my guy is a computer or a person. But the forecast is always accurate, and I appreciate that. I also want to thank you for your hard work, on behalf of the American people. </p><p>I appreciate my friend, Don Evans's leadership. I've known him for a long time.  You're working for a good fellow, if you're working at the commerce department, or at NOAA.  And I want to thank Spence Abraham and Christie Todd Whitman for their service to the country, as well.  I've assembled a fabulous cabinet, people who love their country and work hard. And these are three of some of the finest cabinet officials I've got.</p><p>I want to thank Jim Connaughton, who is the chairman of the council on environmental quality.  He's done a fabulous job of putting this policy together, a policy that I'm about to explain.  </p><p>But before I do, I also want to thank some members of Congress who have worked with us on this initiative.  I want to thank Bob Smith and George Voinovich, two United States senators, for their leadership in pursuing multi-pollutant legislation; as well as Congressmen Billy Tauzin and Joe Barton.  And I want to thank Senator Chuck Hagel and Larry Craig for their work on climate issues.  These members of Congress have had an impact on the policies I am just about to announce. </p><p>America and the world share this common goal:  we must foster economic growth in ways that protect our environment.  We must encourage growth that will provide a better life for citizens, while protecting the land, the water, and the air that sustain life. </p><p>In pursuit of this goal, my government has set two priorities: we must clean our air, and we must address the issue of global climate change. We must also act in a serious and responsible way, given the scientific uncertainties.  While these uncertainties remain, we can begin now to address the human factors that contribute to climate change.  Wise action now is an insurance policy against future risks. </p><p>I have been working with my cabinet to meet these challenges with forward and creative thinking.  I said, if need be, let's challenge the status quo.  But let's always remember, let's do what is in the interest of the American people. </p><p>Today, I'm confident that the environmental path that I announce will benefit the entire world.  This new approach is based on this common sense idea:  that economic growth is key to environmental progress, because it is growth that provides the resources for investment in clean technologies. </p><p>This new approach will harness the power of markets, the creativity of entrepreneurs, and draw upon the best scientific research.  And it will make possible a new partnership with the developing world to meet our common environmental and economic goals. </p><p>We will apply this approach first to the challenge of cleaning the air that Americans breathe.  Today, I call for new clean skies legislation that sets tough new standards to dramatically reduce the three most significant forms of pollution from power plants, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. </p><p>We will cut sulphur dioxide emissions by 73% from current levels.  We will cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 67%.  And, for the first time ever, we will cap emissions of mercury, cutting them by 69%. These cuts will be completed over two measured phases, with one set of emission limits for 2010 and for the other for 2018. </p><p>This legislation will constitute the most significant step America has ever taken - has ever taken - to cut power plant emissions that contribute to urban smog, acid rain and numerous health problems for our citizens. </p><p>Clean skies legislation will not only protect our environment, it will prolong the lives of thousands of Americans with asthma and other respiratory illnesses, as well as with those with heart disease.  And it will reduce the risk to children exposed to mercury during a mother's pregnancy. </p><p>The clean skies legislation will reach our ambitious air quality goals through a market-based cap-and-trade approach that rewards innovation, reduces cost and guarantees results.  Instead of the government telling utilities where and how to cut pollution, we will tell them when and how much to cut.  We will give them a firm deadline and let them find the most innovative ways to meet it. </p><p>We will do this by requiring each facility to have a permit for each ton of pollution it emits.  By making the permits tradeable, this system makes it financially worthwhile for companies to pollute less, giving them an incentive to make early and cost effective reductions. </p><p>This approach enjoys widespread support, with both Democrats and Republicans, because we know it works.  You see, since 1995 we have used a cap-and-trade programmeme for sulphur dioxide pollution.  It has cut more air pollution, this system has reduced more air pollution in the last decade than all other programmes under the 1990 Clean Air Act combined.  And by even more than the law required.  Compliance has been virtually 100%.  It takes only a handful of employees to administer this programme.  And no one had to enter a courtroom to make sure the reductions happened. </p><p>                Because the system gives businesses an incentive to create and install\r\n                innovative technologies, these reductions have cost about 80% less\r\n                than expected.  It helps to keep energy prices affordable for our\r\n                consumers.  And we made this progress during a decade when our\r\n                economy, and our demand for energy, was growing. </p><p>                The clean skies legislation I propose is structured on this approach\r\n                because it works.  It will replace a confusing, ineffective maze of\r\n                regulations for power plants that has created an endless cycle of\r\n                litigation.  Today, hundreds ofms of dollars are spent on lawyers,\r\n                rather than on environmental protection.  The result is painfully slow,\r\n                uncertain and expensive programmes on clean air. </p><p>                Instead, clean skies legislation will put less money into paying lawyers and\r\n                regulators, and money directly into programmes to reduce pollution, to meet\r\n                our national goal.  This approach, I'm absolutely confident, will bring better\r\n                and faster results in cleaning up our air. </p><p>                Now, global climate change presents a different set of challenges and\r\n                requires a different strategy.  The science is more complex, the answers\r\n                are less certain, and the technology is less developed.  So we need a\r\n                flexible approach that can adjust to new information and new technology. </p><p>                I reaffirm America's commitment to the United Nations Framework\r\n                Convention and it's central goal, to stabilise atmospheric greenhouse gas\r\n                concentrations at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference\r\n                with the climate.  Our immediate goal is to reduce America's greenhouse\r\n                gas emissions relative to the size of our economy. </p><p>                My administration is committed to cutting our nation's greenhouse gas\r\n                intensity - how much we emit per unit of economic activity - by 18% over the next 10 years.  This will set America on a path to slow\r\n                the growth of our greenhouse gas emissions and, as science justifies, to\r\n                stop and then reverse the growth of emissions. </p><p>                This is the common sense way to measure progress.  Our nation must have\r\n                economic growth - growth to create opportunity; growth to create a\r\n                higher quality of life for our citizens.  Growth is also what pays for\r\n                investments in clean technologies, increased conservation, and energy\r\n                efficiency.  Meeting our commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas\r\n                intensity by 18% by the year 2012 will prevent over 500m                metric tons of greenhouse gases from going into the atmosphere over the\r\n                course of the decade.  And that is the equivalent of taking 70m cars\r\n                off the road. </p><p>                To achieve this goal, our nation must move forward on many fronts,\r\n                looking at every sector of our economy.  We will challenge American\r\n                businesses to further reduce emissions.  Already, agreements with the\r\n                semiconductor and aluminum industries and others have dramatically cut\r\n                emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases.  We will build on\r\n                these successes with new agreements and greater reductions. </p><p>                Our government will also move forward immediately to create world-class\r\n                standards for measuring and registering emission reductions. And we will\r\n                give transferable credits to companies that can show real emission\r\n                reductions. </p><p>                We will promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology,\r\n                as well as nuclear power, which produces no greenhouse gas\r\n                emissions.  And we will work to safely improve fuel economy for our cars\r\n                and our trucks. </p><p>                Overall, my budget devotes $4.5 billion to addressing climate change -\r\n                more than any other nation's commitment in the entire world.  This is an\r\n                increase of more than $700m over last year's budget.  Our nation will\r\n                continue to lead the world in basic climate and science research to\r\n                address gaps in our knowledge that are important to decision makers. </p><p>                When we make decisions, we want to make sure we do so on sound\r\n                science; not what sounds good, but what is real.  And the United States\r\n                leads the world in providing that kind of research.  We'll devote $588m towards the research and development of energy conservation\r\n                technologies.  We must and we will conserve more in the United\r\n                States.  And we will spend $408m toward research and development\r\n                on renewables, on renewable energy. </p><p>                This funding includes $150m for an initiative that Spence Abraham laid\r\n                out the other day, $150m for the freedom car initiative, which will\r\n                advance the prospect of breakthrough zero-emission fuel cell technologies.</p><p>                My comprehensive energy plan, the first energy plan that any\r\n                administration has put out in a long period of time, provides $4.6bn                over the next five years in clean energy tax incentives to encourage\r\n                purchases of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, to promote residential solar\r\n                energy, and to reward investments in wind, solar and biomass energy\r\n                production.  And we will look for ways to increase the amount of carbon\r\n                stored by America's farms and forests through a strong conservation title\r\n                in the farm bill.  I have asked Secretary Veneman to recommend new\r\n                targeted incentives for landowners to increase carbon storage. </p><p>                By doing all these things, by giving companies incentives to cut emissions,\r\n                by diversifying our energy supply to include cleaner fuels, by increasing\r\n                conservation, by increasing research and development and tax incentives\r\n                for energy efficiency and clean technologies, and by increasing carbon\r\n                storage, I am absolutely confident that America will reach the goal that I\r\n                have set. </p><p>                If, however, by 2012, our progress is not sufficient and sound science\r\n                justifies further action, the United States will respond with additional\r\n                measures that may include broad-based market programmes as well as\r\n                additional incentives and voluntary measures designed to accelerate\r\n                technology development and deployment. </p><p>                Addressing global climate change will require a sustained effort over many\r\n                generations.  My approach recognizes that economic growth is the\r\n                solution, not the problem.  Because a nation that grows its economy is a\r\n                nation that can afford investments and new technologies. </p><p>                The approach taken under the Kyoto protocol would have required the\r\n                United States to make deep and immediate cuts in our economy to meet\r\n                an arbitrary target.  It would have cost our economy up to $400bn and\r\n                we would have lost 4.9m jobs. </p><p>                As President of the United States, charged with safeguarding the welfare\r\n                of the American people and American workers, I will not commit our nation\r\n                to an unsound international treaty that will throw millions of our citizens\r\n                out of work.  Yet, we recognise our international responsibilities.  So in\r\n                addition to acting here at home, the United States will actively help\r\n                developing nations grow along a more efficient, more environmentally\r\n                responsible path. </p><p>                The hope of growth and opportunity and prosperity is universal.  It's the\r\n                dream and right of every society on our globe.  The United States wants\r\n                to foster economic growth in the developing world, including the world's\r\n                poorest nations.  We want to help them realise their potential, and bring\r\n                the benefits of growth to their peoples, including better health, and better\r\n                schools and a cleaner environment. </p><p>                It would be unfair - indeed, counterproductive - to condemn developing\r\n                nations to slow growth or no growth by insisting that they take on\r\n                impractical and unrealistic greenhouse gas targets.  Yet, developing\r\n                nations such as China and India already account for a majority of the\r\n                world's greenhouse gas emissions, and it would be irresponsible to absolve\r\n                them from shouldering some of the shared obligations. </p><p>                The greenhouse gas intensity approach I put forward today gives\r\n                developing countries a yardstick for progress on climate change that\r\n                recognises their right to economic development.  I look forward to\r\n                discussing this new approach next week, when I go to China and Japan\r\n                and South Korea.  The United States will not interfere with the plans of\r\n                any nation that chooses to ratify the Kyoto protocol.  But I will intend to\r\n                work with nations, especially the poor and developing nations, to show the\r\n                world that there is a better approach, that we can build our future\r\n                prosperity along a cleaner and better path. </p><p>                My budget includes over $220m for the US agency for international\r\ndevelopment and a global environmental facility to help developing\r\n                countries better measure, reduce emissions, and to help them invest in\r\n                clean and renewable energy technologies.  Many of these technologies,\r\n                which we take for granted in our own country, are not being used in the\r\n                developing world.  We can help ensure that the benefits of these\r\n                technologies are more broadly shared.  Such efforts have helped bring\r\n                solar energy to Bangladesh, hydroelectric energy to the Philippines,\r\n                geothermal electricity to Kenya.  These projects are bringing jobs and\r\n                environmental benefits to these nations, and we will build on these\r\n                successes. </p><p>                The new budget also provides $40m under the Tropical Forest\r\n                Conservation Act to help countries redirect debt payments towards\r\n                protecting tropical forests, forests that store millions of tons of carbon.\r\n                And I've also ordered the secretary of state to develop a new initiative to\r\n                help developing countries stop illegal logging, a practice that destroys\r\n                biodiversity and releasesms of tons of greenhouse gases into the\r\n                atmosphere. </p><p>                And, finally, my government is following through on our commitment to\r\n                provide $25m for climate observation systems in developing countries\r\n                that will help scientists understand the dynamics of climate change. </p><p>                To clean the air, and to address climate change, we need to recognise that economic growth and environmental protection go hand in hand.\r\n                Affluent societies are the ones that demand, and can therefore afford, the\r\n                most environmental protection.  Prosperity is what allows us to commit\r\n                more and more resources to environmental protection.  And in the coming\r\n                decades, the world needs to develop and deploy billions of dollars of\r\n                technologies that generate energy in cleaner ways.  And we need strong\r\n                economic growth to make that possible. </p><p>                Americans are among the most creative people in our history.  We have\r\n                used radio waves to peer into the deepest reaches of space.  We cracked\r\n                life's genetic code.  We have made our air and land and water significantly\r\n                cleaner, even as we have built the world's strongest economy. </p><p>                When I see what Americans have done, I know what we can do.  We can\r\n                tap the power of economic growth to further protect our environment for\r\n                generations that follow.  And that's what we're going to do. </p><p>                Thank you.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2002/feb/14/usnews.globalwarming","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2002/feb/14/usnews.globalwarming","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Richard Bingley: Arms to Africa scar Britain's conscience","webPublicationDate":"2002-02-03T01:42:30Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2002/feb/03/armstrade","fields":{"body":"Tony Blair's messianic whistle-stop world tours - last month India and next week Africa - offer plenty of opportunity for Labour's spin doctors to drum up favourable publicity. Yet the reality that Britain's central role in the global arms trade fatally undermines the government's professed agenda of global development.  British arms fuel conflict and divert extremely-scarce resources from development: they are a scar on the conscience of an internationalist Prime Minister.<P>Tony Blair and his international development secretary, Clare Short will talk about how they can play a role in shedding Africa of its violent and colonial past. Blair wants to set out a new vision of British interests, no longer shaped by neo-colonial turf wars or self-serving capitalists. Blair and Short say, too, that they want to work in partnership with those African governments committed to health, education and human development. One very obvious way to reduce tension and pressure states into spending more on domestic development is to reduce arms sales. Britain is the world's second largest arms vendor and has some clout here both as a supplier and by setting an example of restraint.<P>Blair's peace-building trip to an Indian sub-continent perilously close to war between two nuclear states ended in a publicity sting - as The Guardian revealed that British companies were being sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry to attend an arms exhibition in Delhi at the end of this month.  In Africa too, Blair's government will be sponsoring companies to attend an arms exhibition - Africa Aerospace and Defence 2002.  The taxpayer, as we did two years ago, will also foot the bill for Defence Export Services Organisations (DESO), a dedicated department within the Ministry of Defence charged with assisting military exports, to make the trip to Africa. A South African general Julius Kriel, describes these exhibitions as \"very much a show for Africa\".  Over 20 African countries including Algeria, Nigeria and Burundi attended the last. With government support, British companies are effectively enticing African governments to buy technology that many could either misuse or ill afford.<P>South Africa itself is still a country cruelly challenged by ubiquitous crime, HIV/Aids and homelessness.  Nevertheless, Mr Blair personally visited the country in 1999 to lobby for a British chunk of a £4bn arms deal that South African defence officials eventually signed.  In the same year, Clare Short's department for international development (DFID) granted a miserly £47.8m aid package to Pretoria. <P>Britain's commitment to \"sustainable development\" has also been called into question recently, by Britain granting an export licence for a £28m air traffic control system to Tanzania.  Even the IMF, which is usually reticent about criticising specific acquisitions, announced loudly that Tanzania's local security concerns -  which are mainly poachers - meant that it could have spent a quarter on an adequate system.<P>Of course, some will argue that it is \"neo-colonial\" of us in Britain to deliver homilies to our poorer brethren in Africa about what, or what they shouldn't, spend their money on.  Perhaps this is a fair philosophical point. But it is less compelling than economic reasons to speak out against these increasing arms sales to Africa, many of which would not take place if they were not effectively subsidised by Britain.<P>The DTI has underwritten South Africa's purchase of BAE Hawk jets by £1.7bn.  This means if the extremely fragile economy of South Africa defaults in payments to the UK, the taxpayer picks up the bill.<P>Tanzania is one of the poorest nations on earth.  Its population is over half of Britain's, but its GDP is on the same keel as three of our major city councils.  Part of the £750m of aid Tanzania received from the international community last year was £64m from London.  Almost half of this went straight back into the hands of BAE engineers on the Isle of Wight.<P>Even more serious costs to Africa than the drain of economic resources are the continued exports that could be used dangerously to deny human rights or arbitrarily settle disputes. The problem of small arms is pandemic on that continent. Labour pushed for a non-legally binding EU Code of Conduct, which was accepted in 1998.  Among other commitments, were \"the respect of human rights\" and the \"preservation of regional peace, security and stability\".  Since Labour came to government, small arms (typically pistols, assault rifles and machine-guns) have been sanctioned for sale to Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Sierra Leone and Zambia. Amnesty International's latest report says that in Kenya \"torturing by security officials is widespread\".  Moreover, Morocco and Western Sahara have been involved in a bitter border dispute, supervised by the United Nations. Labour decided to supply Hawk spare parts to Mugabe's air force right up to the beginning of 2000, despite Zimbabwe's involvement in the Congo war and internal political repression.<P>When Labour came to power it inherited export control laws from before the Second World War.  This threw up (along with Tory government complicity) the \"arms to Iraq affair' and weapons sales to states such as Indonesia which were guilty of immense breaches of international law. To counter the problems of this outdated and inadequate legislation, Labour recently introduced an export bill into parliament.  Yet, to cross-party dismay, the government dropped a clause calling for arms exports to be stopped if they threatened \"sustainable development\". The bill will return to Parliament next week while Blair is in Africa - yet the government in opposing cross-party attempts to restore the clause.<P>British arms sales to Africa leaped from £52m (in 1999) to £125m a year later.  When the applications for South African export licences tumble through the doors of the DTI, while cheques leave for Africa from DFID, we will in all likelihood be facing a situation where arms sales to the continent outnumber the aid Britain sends there. For many of us, watching Mr Blair strut through an anonymous street somewhere south of the Sahara next week, this sad equation provides yet another disappointing epitaph to a government that promised so much.<P><B>Richard Bingley</B> is spokesman for Campaign Against Arms Trade.

Yesterday, Cherie Booth opened the couple's new &#163;12m factory, which will produce 30m jars of sauce a year - including Britain's favourite, tikka masala. According to Mrs Pathak, it is the largest Indian food factory in the world. </p><p>As Ms Booth toured the spice blending vats and sauce bottling lines - built over what once was a busy colliery - she may well have pondered how dramatically the local industrial landscape has changed.  </p><p>The Pathaks are privately aware that some local people felt uncomfortable when they learned of plans for a curry factory on the site of the old pit. Their reception at Leigh, near Wigan, the couple insist, has been a warm one.  </p><p>The factory has taken on more than 250 workers on round-the-clock shifts and is regarded as a good employer. One local woman points out that the pungent smells wafting from the factory doors have become as much a feature of modern British culture as mining once was.    </p><p><strong> Cultural challenge</strong><br />   The culture gap presents a challenge for Patak's as a business. \"Many of our visitors are amazed to learn there's not a single Asian on the shopfloor,\" says Mrs Pathak after a lunch at the factory - a cheese sandwich and a plate of slimline oven-ready chips. \"It's not that we don't want to employ them - there just aren't any around here.\" Wigan has one of the lowest ethnic minority populations in the country.  </p><p>The Pathaks were particularly proud to welcome Ms Booth yesterday because, they say, recognition for immigrant entrepreneurs remains such a rarity in Britain. \"We understand what it means to live here as foreigners,\" says Mr Pathak. \"We've faced prejudice ever since we were kids. It's a social disease.\"  </p><p>Discrimination, the Pathaks argue, is not restricted to flashpoints such as Oldham in Greater Manchester or Eltham in south-east London, it pervades many areas of British life. There is a \"fear factor\" in the City of London, says Mr Pathak. \"Asians are now a large community, with entrepreneurial flair. The City is sometimes scared by this.\"  </p><p>Nevertheless, Patak's Foods flourished as Britain's love affair with Indian cuisine blossomed. More than 40 years after Mr Pathak began helping his father sell pakoras and bhajis to Indian ex-pats from the kitchen of their north London home, the   couple have transformed the operation into an international business with an estimated value of &#163;50m.  </p><p>British curry lovers - both Indian families and a band of non-Asian enthusiasts - generate the majority of Patak's &#163;50m turnover. Mrs Pathak devotes much of her time to developing products for this \"educated\" market and continues to introduce regional Indian dishes to a receptive UK audience.  </p><p>Mr Pathak points out that as well as a carefully nurtured reputation for authenticity, the success of Patak's has also come from accommodating western attitudes and tastes - dropping the 'h' from the family's trading name is one example.  </p><p>A pragmatic approach is necessary in overseas markets such as the United States where, he says, successful Patak's products are rarely branded as Indian.  </p><p>\"If they have spicy buffalo wings over there, we'll give them tandoori wings as well - though we don't necessarily have to call them 'tandoori',\" he says, with a   smile. \"You have to appreciate America is a very insular country.\"  </p><p>By contrast, Patak's in the UK quickly carved out a central role for itself as the number of Asian restaurants soared in the 1970s and 1980s.  </p><p>The couple say many of the chefs - predominantly Bangladeshi former mill workers - started out with little experience in the kitchen. With the help of easy-to-use pastes from Patak's and others they were quickly able to create an authentic sauce before adding their own signature flavours.  </p><p>\"Those guys work damned hard; we are just helping by taking away all the labour from the preparation process,\" Mr Pathak says. In many cases, however, he admits the result is a long list of dishes on the menu but little culinary flare.  </p><p>Much of Patak's expertise in blending spices and producing pickles and chutneys comes from Mr Pathak's father Lakhubhai who fled Uganda for London in 1956 after Mau Mau terror attacks on Asians. Mr Pathak tells how his father \"worked like a slave\" in a basement kitchen in Kentish Town, north London, making samosas, pakoras and pickles by hand.  </p><p>At the age of six, Mr Pathak worked as errand boy, travelling free on trains and buses to deliver parcels to customers around London. \"Because we had no English, my father would write the address on a piece of paper in one pocket and our return address was on a paper in the other pocket\" he recalls. \"We showed the bus driver the note in our left pocket to go, and the note in our right to come back.\"  </p><p>Today, many of the core recipes remain unchanged and, Mr Pathak says, the automated blending vats have been modelled on the saucepan and spoon used by his father more than 40 years ago.  </p><p>While the Patak's chairman describes his father as \"a great role model\", he is nevertheless uneasy discussing the role Lakhubhai Pathak played in the downfall of the former Indian prime minister P V Narasimha Rao, five years ago.    </p><p><strong> Private dealings</strong><br />    In 1997, and in very poor health, Lakhubhai Pathak stunned a courtroom in Delhi by revealing that 14 years earlier he paid $100,000 to Rao's guru on the understanding that the then foreign minster would secure Lakhubhai a government paper pulp contract. He never delivered, and the corruption charges sparked a deluge of allegations which ended in a three-year jail sentence for Rao.  </p><p>It is a \"closed-chest thing for us now,\"the couple say. \"They were his private business dealings...

He won a chestful of gallantry awards, was the recipient of every possible establishment honour, and had a habit of questioning Britain's nuclear deterrent strategy, especially the expense of Trident submarines. <P>In 1944, at the age of only 29, he became the army's youngest brigadier. In 1973, as the head of Britain's entire armed services, he was promoted to field marshal. With a wealth of colonial experience behind him, he was wheeled out of retirement in 1977 to oversee the transition to black majority rule in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), arriving in the country in full dress uniform.  <P>Later, in the House of Lords, Carver began to think out loud about awkward national questions, including defence policy, relations between the United States and western Europe, and global warming. In no sense a radical or a candidate for canonisation by CND, he nevertheless questioned the often woolly, contradictory and, in his eyes, downright dangerous thinking behind western nuclear strategy and Britain's independent deterrent.  <P>He consistently challenged such concepts as pre-emptive strikes, winnable limited nuclear exchanges and the reliance on tactical nuclear weapons as a cheap substitute for conventional defence. He condemned Ronald Reagan's threats of a first nuclear strike as \"either bluff or suicide\".  <P>Carver believed that nuclear weapons were for retaliation in kind only; they could not be used even to stave off imminent defeat. In that form alone, he continued to think of the deterrent as having prevented the two superpowers from going to war in and over Europe since 1945. But he constantly warned that Nato would come off worse in any nuclear exchange, whether tactical or strategic.  <P>After the fall of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, he inveighed against the vast expense and unjustified proliferation of Britain's Trident submarines. He saw \"no military logic\" in the decision.  <P>The second of four sons of Harold Carver, of Bletchingley, Surrey, he was descended from the Duke of Wellington through his mother, Winifred Anne Gabrielle (n&#233;e Wellesey). He should have gone to university after schooling at Winchester, but his businessman father's finances were affected by the depression, which was particuarly hard on the Manchester cotton trade. So he decided to go into newspapers, thinking he would spend four years in the army first.  <P>After passing out from Sandhurst, however, he concluded that journalism was a rather \"dicey\" choice, and opted to become a career officer. Winchester notwithstanding, it was a career that advanced overwhelmingly on merit. Undistinguished as a scholar or sportsman, he showed early signs of unusual determination when he set out to overcome a boyhood stutter.  <P>A taste for modernity and technological progress revealed itself in his choice of the Royal Tank Corps, into which he was commissioned in 1935. The four years he envisaged spending in the army should have ended in 1939, though, in the event, that year became the beginning of his outstandingly \"good war.\" He won two mentions in dispatches, the MC and two DSOs, all for bravery, and the CBE in 1945, at the age of 30, for exceptional staff work.  <P>He fought in tanks in the North Africa campaign, winning his MC in the bitter struggle for Tobruk in 1941 - throughout and beyond his time as a regimental officer, Carver was a tank man. A substantive captain, he was made temporary acting lieutenant-colonel at the age of 27, on taking up a brief posting as GS01 (senior staff officer) of the 7th Armoured Division - the Desert Rats - in 1942. His divisional general was the later Field Marshal John Harding, whose biography he wrote in 1978.  <P>As commanding officer of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment from April 1943, Carver won his first DSO, leading a dangerous reconnaissance before the decisive battle of El Alamein, a feat that helped to earn him the lasting approval of Montgomery. The second DSO followed the Allied landing at Salerno, after which he played a leading part in the capture of Naples. He also led his regiment into Normandy in June 1944. Shortly afterwards, at the age of 29, he was given the command of 4th Independent Armoured Brigade in time for the last push into northern Germany.  <P>All of Carver's citations mentioned his coolness under fire, and he did not suffer fools gladly, even when they were his superiors. Cool but not cold, direct and abrasive when necessary, but also with a pronounced romantic streak, he had moral as well as physical courage. His inability to see eye to eye with at least one general, in north Africa and later, led to complaints. But faced with demands to remove him, Montgomery promoted him full colonel, and took him on his staff.  <P>After the war, Carver, inevitably, took part in the military rearguard actions accompanying Britain's withdrawal from empire. In 1954, he was deputy chief and, a year later, chief of staff in Kenya during the Mau-Mau emergency, a difficult period during which he won another mention in dispatches. The Suez disaster of 1956 convinced him that Britain should withdraw from the region to concentrate on Europe.  <P>After two years as director of plans at the old War Office from 1958, Carver led the 6th Infantry Brigade Group until 1962, when he became the major-general commanding a division of the strategic reserve. As such, he was sent to Cyprus to head a multi-national truce force, before being appointed deputy UN commander on the divided island.  <P>His period from 1964-66, as director of army staff duties, was an unhappy interlude, in which he became notorious as the \"butcher\" of the Terri torial army, accused of lacking imagination in the difficult task of scaling down the reserves. It was, nevertheless, followed in 1966 by promotion to lieutenant-general, a knighthood and command of Britain's Far East land forces. In January 1967, he was promoted again, to full general and C-in-C Far East.  <P>Carver returned home in 1969 as GOC-in-C, southern command, becoming chief of the general staff two years later. In 1973, he was promoted to field marshal and began a three-year term as chief of the defence staff, leaving in 1976 before being made a life peer a year later.  <P>That Carver had no intention of quietly fading away, as old soldiers are supposed to do, was shown long before then. His history of the Royal Scots Greys, written as early as 1954, was to be the first of 12 books, and his studies of Alamein and Tobruk, in the early 1960s, were quickly hailed as standard works. There were also half a dozen volumes on military strategy, the Harding biography and his own memoirs, Out Of Step (1989). His 1992 review of British postwar defence policy, nicely entitled Tightrope Walking, had a style that was unadorned, no-nonsense and reassuringly direct.  <P>He also took his share of those semi-honorary duties senior officers are expected to fill, including colonel commandant of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (1966-76), of the Royal Tank Regiment (1968-72) and of the Royal Armoured Corps (1974-77).  <P>At the end of October 1977, Carver was called out of retirement to become resident commissioner designate for Rhodesia, charged with implementing the Anglo-American Owen-Young plan for ending the UDI deadlock. But Ian Smith's supporters were not quite at the end of their tether, and the guerrillas not yet strong enough to force a settlement, and he resigned after 14 months of frustration.  <P>As chairman of the Lords' science and technology committee, Carver demanded a greater sense of urgency and more research funding from a government he regarded as recklessly complacent about global warming.  <P>Never an outstanding sportsman, he enthusiastically played tennis and croquet, and sailed dinghies, for most of his adult life. He also liked to brew his own ale, and developed a passion for opera, especially Verdi. In 1947, he married a colonel's daughter, Edith Lowry-Corry. They had two sons and two daughters.  <P><B>&#183;</B> Richard Michael Power Carver, Lord Carver, soldier and writer, born April 24 1915; died December 9 2001"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/dec/12/guardianobituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/news/2001/dec/12/guardianobituaries","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Eco soundings","webPublicationDate":"2001-11-14T07:47:55Z","sectionId":"society","id":"society/2001/nov/14/environment","fields":{"body":"<p><strong> Caught Short</strong><br /> </p><p>Clare Short has her qualities, but she sure does not seem to like NGOs. When the mines advisory group and Adopt a Minefield got together to launch a major de-mining operation in Vietnam, the idea was that governments and the public should work together. So it was that the US embassy entered into the spirit of the London event with a &#163;500,000 donation to the groups. But when Carol Hinchley of the Foreign Office stood up, the tone of the evening changed. Hinchley told the guests how the Department for International Development - Clare's lot - had decided to channel all its landmine work through UN agencies such as the UN Development programme. This means that the UN will take a 14% administration charge on the funds that would otherwise have gone straight from the Treasury to fund landmine clearance and rehabilitation activities. The NGOs now face another bureaucratic mountain trying to get the money out of the UN. The move is seen as just the latest shot from Short in her ground war against the NGOs who she so lauded when in opposition.</p><p><strong> Grains of hope</strong><br /> </p><p>We've heard the promises of \"miracle\" golden rice, the GM \"humanitarian crop\" that the biotech industry fervently hopes will one day give the poor extra vitamin A and give themselves some extra credibility. It's a shame that when it was last heard of it was still many years from the market, and that people may need to eat about 3kg of the stuff to get their full quota of vitamin A, but we do wish it well. Meanwhile, few people know about IR68114, a strain of conventional rice being tested by nuns in the Philippines after development at the International Rice Research Institute. IR68114 emerged unexpectedly in the search for salt resistant rice strains and it seems the grain is absolutely jam-packed with iron and zinc and has enough beta-carotene to easily meet vitamin A requirements in a typical Asian diet. Earlier this year it was tested for six months with very promising results on 27 anaemic nuns. Now 300 more nuns are taking part in what is being called \"the largest feeding trial ever conducted involving a staple food\". If IR68114 comes up to expectations, it could help 3.7bn people avoid iron-deficiency anaemia, the most widespread nutrient deficiency in the world. Just like that. No new technologies. No hype. No trouble. Moreover, this \"backward\" technology would be cheap, without patents and could be applied to casava and other staples.</p><p><strong> Tribal gatherings</strong><br /> </p><p>Spot the difference. The Ogiek people, an indigenous group who live in the Mau forests of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya face eviction and destitution in a government plan to privatise (ie cut down the trees and develop) more than 170,000 acres of publicly owned forest that is their ancestral home. Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi government is planning an \"eco-park\" in the Moulvibazar hills district. This will involve clearance of forests inhabited by Khasi and Garo indigenous peoples. Both governments claim they will bring economic development and \"biodiversity conservation\" but in both places the real intention seems to be to remove ethnic groups. The only difference we can spot is that the Bangladeshis want to create a \"cultural village\", where the indigenous peoples - or tribals - will be on display for tourists.</p><p><strong> Sites for sore eyes</strong><br /> </p><p>Good to see English Nature is publishing its \"corporate plan\" for the next few years, but disturbing to find among all the promises and good intentions the statement that the condition of more than 15% of England's sites of special scientific interest is actually deteriorating. A further 27% of these sites are in poor condition and not improving and, based on a sample of 66% of all SSSIs, only 58% are actually in good nick.

But there's a perfectly reasonable explanation. The trial, in a field near Winchester, was recently conducted by Southampton University, to establish the optimum time for harvesting salad. Researchers found that leaves picked between 8pm and 10pm, and refrigerated promptly, stayed fresh for three to four days longer than those picked at other times of the day. <P>According to Dr Gail Taylor, the team's leader, the improved longevity is probably due to a number of factors (including the build-up of sugars and salts in the leaves during daytime). And lollo rosso is not alone. Sweet basil has been shown to last up to 170% longer when picked at night. \"We've yet to identify the precise causes,\" explains Dr Taylor, \"but our initial findings are very exciting, and we're looking forward to running further field trials in Kenya.\" <P>The changes in plants at night is not just of interest to boffins, though. Lunar gardeners say they have known about the benefits of nocturnal vegetable management for years, and that it's the position of the moon that holds the key to success. They might sound like some kind of small, obscure sect, but lunar gardeners are perfectly sane, and there's more of them than you might think. Although no firm figures exist, annual sales of various lunar gardening calendars suggest a rising number in the UK, currently somewhere between 2,000 and 10,000. <P>John Harris has been convinced of the benefits of organic gardening and companion planting since the early 1960s. He sees the idea of working with the moon's influence as a natural continuation of those principles. \"I'm carrying on the same tradition as the Maoris, Incas, Romans and countless others,\" says Harris, head gardener at Tresillian,in Cornwall, a Mecca for lunar gardeners from across Europe. \"The moon's gravitational pull on the earth's moisture is mankind's oldest tool. Since every organism on the planet is largely made up of water, it makes sense to work in harmony with it.\"<P>Lunar gardening reached its zenith in England during the Elizabethan period, with learned works, such as The Gardener's Labyrinth of 1577, by Thomas Hill, offering elaborate astrological advice. However, even earlier texts exist, including a 14th-century treatise which exhorts readers to pick marigolds only when the moon is \"in the sign of the Virgin\". <P>\"People the world over have gardened according to the phases of the moon for millennia,\" says lunar gardening writer, Dr Nick Kollerstrom. \"Mainland Europe maintains a strong tradition to this day. However, by the late 18th century, an increased culture of scientism, together with our unpredictable climate, meant that here, lunar gardening survived only as part of a verbal folklore tradition.\" <P>Confusingly, several different, sometimes contradictory, systems are practised today. All emphasise the importance of organic methods, such as biodynamic gardening, and all make use of one of the various lunar calendars. At its most basic, there are thought to be two effects at work: moonlight, plus the moon's gravitational pull on the earth's water, both of which increase and decrease with the waxing and waning of the moon. More moonlight leads to better top growth, while root growth is stimulated when the water table drops as a result of reduced gravitational pull, or so the theory goes. Seeds are best planted at new moon, for example, while crops harvested at night, around full moon, are particularly moist. <P>Full moon is also the time to transplant, but pruning should be left until levels of sap in the plant have fallen. <P>If your geography O-level is a little rusty, here is a quick recap on tides: the moon orbits the earth as the earth orbits the sun. The moon is so close to the earth that its gravitational influence is greater than that of the sun. Okay so far? Tides can be \"high\" or \"low\". The highest high tides occur when the sun, earth and moon align - at new or full moon. At the half-moon stage, the moon's gravitational pull on the earth is at right angles to that of the sun, which counteracts it, resulting in the lowest high tides of the lunar month. Perfectly obvious, really. <P>So, what about ground water? \"It's quite possible that there is an effect, but how much of one is difficult to say,\" explains Professor Alan Dodson, of Nottingham University. \"However, the earth's crust is also subject to 'tides', rising and falling in phase with the seas. The amount of movement varies from place to place, and one of the strongest effects occurs in Cornwall.\" <P>But how does lunar gardening work in practice? Harry Buckoke, aged 10, was busy when I called, so I spoke to his dad, Peter. \"It's been Harry's ambition for several years to become a farmer,\" he says. \"We've divided our garden into a four-block rotating system. Harry grows maize, wheat, barley, oil-seed rape, beans and even some potatoes. We thought it might be fun to garden biodynamically and, although we're beginners,it's enormously enjoyable.\" <P>I wondered if they found adhering to a calendar restrictive. \"Hypothetically, even if the calendar suggested planting carrots at 2am, we could do it,\" says Peter. \"It would be a great adventure. I can imagine, though, that it might be more difficult to use these methods on a large scale.\" <P>Some sceptics, however, maintain that it's all nonsense. \"Lunar gardening does not seem to have any hard scientific evidence to support it,\" says Guy Barter, of the Royal Horticultural Society at Wisley. <P>Peter Harper, who has run trials on lunar gardening at the Centre For Alternative Technology, in Powys, is less dismissive. No discernible results emerged in support of any particular theory, he says. \"However, I would certainly advocate more research.\" \r\nIt seems those lunar gardeners can't be sent to the asylum just yet.   <P><b>Biodynamic Agricultural Association, 01453 759501 (<a href=\"http://www.anth.org.uk/biodynamic\" target=\"_new\">/www.anth.org.uk/biodynamic</a>).

But calls to the terrorist leader's laptop-size satphone - relayed via an Inmarsat satellite 40,000 km over the Indian Ocean - are going unanswered. </p><p>His number - 00873 682505331 - was disclosed earlier this year in the New York trial of his associates for bombing the US embassy in Kenya. Callers now hear a message stating he is \"not logged on or not in the dialled ocean region\".   </p><p>His satphone was used frequently during the 90s. Bin Laden was heard advising Taliban leaders to promote heroin exports to the west. National Security Agency (NSA) officials even played recordings of him talking to his mother to security-cleared visitors to their headquarters, as a trophy of their prowess. After failing to warn of the attack, the agency has fallen silent.  </p><p>According to US intelligence, the satellite phone has not been switched on all year. Experts do not believe he was unaware of the US eavesdropping, which is simple to do. Even amateurs can   tap Inmarsat using an antenna made of DIY parts and a scanner bought for &#163;150 in the high street. Bin Laden may, however, have been unaware that NSA \"sigint\" satellites, listening from space, could pinpoint his location. The satellites are controlled from ground stations near Denver, Munich, and at Menwith Hill in Yorkshire. But they could only locate him when he was logged on.  </p><p>Using this method, US intelligence believed in 1998 that they had found him. In August 1998, President Clinton authorised a cruise missile attack on a training camp at Khost, Afghanistan. By the time the missiles landed, Bin Laden had gone.  </p><p>Having failed to forestall the worst attack of all, many Americans have taken to blaming new technology.  </p><p>Congress will shortly debate a new Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, which will further loosen controls on electronic surveillance. The NSA already operates a global communications surveillance system in conjunction with Britain's GCHQ. One of the proposed provisions would allow GCHQ to conduct random surveillance of American citizens' communications and send them on. This would breach the US bill of rights. (Non US citizens have no protection.)  </p><p>The potential use by terrorists of the net and encryption have for years been a major target of intelligence agencies and politicians. They have demanded curbs on privacy and the banning of encryption. Throughout the 90s, the IT community was continually focused on whether or not security software that used encryption should also use \"escrow\". Escrow requires keys allowing private messages to be decoded to be given to the government.  </p><p>In December 1999, the US government abandoned controls on the use of \"strong encryption\". It was also forced, on commercial grounds, to follow European countries and abandon the demand that encryption be illegal unless escrowed.  </p><p>In the US and in Britain, some advocates of escrow had seemed almost eager to see a major terrorist disaster using internet encryption, to prove them right. Privacy campaigners countered that banning strong encryption would never prevent terrorism but would damage e-commerce.  </p><p>Within hours of the carnage in America, these arguments were back in the   headlines. A day after the attack, it was asserted that the net and encryption was undoubtedly to blame, and must have been used to coordinate the attacks.  </p><p>Seven months earlier, a widely quoted newspaper report had claimed that bin Laden's followers were operating a communications network based on encrypted messages concealed inside pornographic pictures. This technique, steganography, hides a coded message inside a picture or music file by making numerous small changes to data. The changes are invisible to ordinary viewers or listeners, but can be read by special software.  </p><p>The February report luridly alleged that his group had relayed the \"encrypted blueprints of the next terrorist attack against the United States\", including maps of targets, inside \"X-rated pictures on several pornographic web sites\" (see <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/2001-02-05-binladen.htm\">www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/2001-02-05-binladen.htm</a>) .  </p><p>This month's attacks have provided the first, tragic, test of who was right about the net, encryption and terrorism. The answers, so far as they are known, were given last Tuesday by the FBI at a Washington briefing. FBI assistant director Ron Dick,   head of the US National Infrastructure Protection Centre, told reporters that the hijackers had used the net, and \"used it well\".  </p><p>FBI investigators had been able to locate hundreds of email communications, sent 30 to 45 days before the attack. Records had been obtained from internet service providers and from public libraries. The messages, in both English and Arabic, were sent within the US and internationally. They had been sent from personal computers or from public sites such as libraries. They used a variety of ISPs, including accounts on Hotmail.  </p><p>According to the FBI, the conspirators had not used encryption or concealment methods. Once found, the emails could be openly read.  </p><p>The allegation that plans have been hidden inside internet porn has, so far, proven unsupported. A few days before the attack, a team from the University of Michigan reported they had searched for images that might contain terror plans, using a network of computers to look for the \"signature\" of steganography. According to researchers at the Centre for Information Technology Integration, they \"analysed two million images_ but have not    been able to find a single hidden message\" (see <a href=\"http://www.citi.umich.edu/techreports/reports/citi-tr-01-11.pdf\">www.citi.umich.edu/techreports/reports/citi-tr-01-11.pdf</a>).  </p><p>The FBI said this week they had nothing further to add. US and British communications intelligence agencies are also examining past internet intercepts. Information will be incorporated into a secret report to the US Congress, but will not be made publicly available. One US senator has claimed that soon after the attack, NSA received a call from a US cell phone to a \"suspected bin Laden operative in Europe\" announcing: \"We hit the targets.\"  </p><p>Despite the forthright position taken by the FBI, some US newspapers have continued to report technological myths in circulation before the attack. Last Friday, the Washington Post claimed the inventor of the widely used PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption system, Phil Zimmermann, had been \"crying every day... overwhelmed with feelings of guilt\". Although the FBI had already said they had found no evidence of these terrorists using encryption, Post readers were told that Zimmermann \"has trouble dealing with the reality that his software was likely used for evil\". (see <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1234-2001Sep20.html\">www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1234-2001Sep20.html</a>)  </p><p>In a public statement this week, Zimmermann accused the Post of serious misrepresentation in publishing things he never said. \"Read my lips,\" he said, \"I have no regrets about developing PGP.\" His grief had been for the victims, not for culpability about his invention.  </p><p>The Washington Post and other US newspapers have also reported that bin Laden has access to satellites more powerful than the NSA's, and uses a communications company controlled by a relative to overcome US monitoring. Neither the satellites nor the company exist.  </p><p>Dr Brian Gladman, formerly responsible for electronic security at the Ministry of Defence and Nato, believes that the reason that the terrorists didn't use encrypted email is that it would have \"stood out like a sore thumb\" to NSA's surveillance network, enabling them to focus on who they were. There is also evidence that, when communicating, the terrorists used simple open codes to conceal who and what they were talking about. This low-tech method works. Unless given leads about who to watch, even the vast Echelon network run by NSA and GCHQ cannot   separate such messages from innocuous traffic.  </p><p>NSA's problem, says Gladman, is that \"the volume of communications is killing them. They just can't keep up. It's not about encryption.\"  </p><p>NSA has been attempting to keep up with the internet by building huge online storage systems to hold and sift email. The first such system, designed in 1996 and delivered last year, is known as Sombrero VI. It holds a petabyte of information. A petabyte is a million gigabytes, and is roughly equivalent to eight times the information in the Library of Congress. NSA is now implementing a Petaplex system, at least 20 times larger. It is designed to hold internet records for up to 90 days.  </p><p>Dr Gladman and other experts believe that, unless primed by intelligence from traditional agents, these massive spy libraries are doomed to fail. The problem with NSA's purely technological approach is that it cannot know what it is looking for. While computers can search for patterns, the problem of correlating different pieces of information rises exponentially as ever more communications are intercepted. In short, NSA's mighty technology apparatus can easily be   rendered blind, as happened here, if it has nothing to start from.  </p><p>The new legal plans may therefore do more harm than good. According to Cambridge computer security specialist Dr Ian Miller, bringing back escrow \"will damage our security in other ways, and divert an enormous amount of effort that would far better be spent elsewhere. It won't inconvenience competent terrorists in the least.\"  </p><p>PGP inventor Phil Zimmermann thinks the penalty of politicians misunderstanding technology will be even more costly. \"If we install blanket surveillance systems, it will mean the terrorists have won. The terrorists will have cost us our freedom.\" </p><p>&#149; Duncan Campbell is a freelance investigative journalist.</p><p>&#149; Comments to online.feedback @guardian.co.uk</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/sep/27/onlinesupplement.afghanistan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2001/sep/27/onlinesupplement.afghanistan","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"The last dispatch","webPublicationDate":"2001-09-20T02:02:36Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2001/sep/20/afghanistan.features11","fields":{"body":"The journey begins on Sunday, when we are forced to leave Kabul for a 14-hour drive south to Kandahar to petition the Taliban foreign minister for the right to remain in Afghanistan.

Hours after the World Trade Centre was hit, we had been on air from Kabul as rockets whizzed across the sky, an ammunition dump went up in flames and anti-aircraft guns spewed red tracers.  <P>The chances of the Taliban relenting and letting us stay are slim. If we are lucky, we will hit Kandahar at the same time Pakistani diplomats deliver the Taliban an ultimatum from America: deliver Osama bin Laden or else.  <P>Assuming the \"or else\" is a missile attack, I'm not sure if catching it will be a good thing for us. As foreigners we will win every unpopularity contest in town - something that could cost us our lives. As journalists with a videophone, camera and microphone, it could be the scoop of a lifetime.  <P>I mull this over during the bone-breaking car journey. Two drivers have quit in the last few hours; from hoping to travel the unmetalled road in off-road Jeeps we are now forced to do it in clapped-out estate cars.  <P>As for the locals, there is no doubting what they think. Ask people on the street in Afghanistan if they will support the Taliban if the country is attacked and the answer is a unanimous yes. Afghans are proud of their independence and believe they can fight off any invader. There is, however, little apparent planning for the safety of the people. So far, the best form of defence they have been offered by the government came in a rare radio broadcast to the nation by Mullah Mohammed Omar, the spiritual leader of the Taliban, when he told people to put their faith in Allah and not to be afraid of an American attack.  <P>For the Taliban, the defence of military installations, ammunition dumps and government buildings seems to be far higher up the list of priorities. Because they are still at war - battling over the last 5% of the country against the Northern Alliance - they maintain rudimentary defence facilities at key government buildings. They lack a hi-tech defence infrastructure, but what they do have is plenty of willing fighters.  <P>The Taliban say they have had requests from local people to be armed in case of attack. So far, they have declined to issue weapons: they say that since they took control of the country five years ago they have been slowly disarming the population, and they are not about to re-arm them just yet.  <P>Never underestimate the effect on the Afghan psyche of 22 years of war. This is not a country at peace. These are people who can withstand, and are already withstanding, extreme hardship. For many, the closed borders and possible attack are less a traumatic change from a pleasant and cosy life than a slippage into something only slightly worse.  <P>And almost everyone here seems to think an attack is imminent. Those who can have got their families out of town. Eighty-five per cent of the country is rural, and some people have relatives in villages away from the likely targets in the cities. But the reality is that many people are too impoverished after so many years of war. Getting daily food on their plates is enough of an ordeal - never mind the cost of renting a car to get out of town.  <P>Should the religious leaders decide Bin Laden is to be handed over - and should that decision be accepted and implemented by the Taliban - it would be a major reversal of a long-held Taliban position. In the past when the Taliban have faced massive international opposition - for example, over the destruction of the ancient Buddhas carved into mountains in central Afghanistan earlier this year - they have never backed down. So far they have given no indication they will do so now.  <P>Indeed, a turnaround now seems inconceivable. Bin Laden is not just a well-respected guest - he is a much needed ally in their war against the Northern Alliance. His charisma as a famous Mojahedin attracts many young Arabs and Pakistanis keen to fight. Fresh young fighters are essential in the battle to gain control of the whole country. Battles here are often full frontal assaults with high casualties. This is a war of attrition, and the side most able to sustain the losses will most likely win.  <P>Bin Laden also shares the Taliban ideal of creating a pure Islamic state. To sell out on him now would, for most of the Taliban, be selling out on their religion.  <P>In Kandahar, the foreign ministry, under the direction of foreign minister Wahil Achmed, listened carefully to our plea. But for several days now the foreign ministry has been asking foreigners to leave, insisting that they cannot guarantee our safety. Other news organisations and international agencies have withdrawn their staff.  <P>There are precedents here that militate against allowing us to stay: in 1998, shortly after the attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the US followed up with cruise missile attacks on Afghanistan. The UN's compounds were stormed and an Italian UN official was shot and killed. The Taliban do not want that sort of negative press - and, under the Afghan honour system, they feel honour-bound to prevent something happening to any of their guests. Nor can it be assumed that the Taliban could control the population if there was a sustained attack on the country.  <P>And so, on Wednesday, the ruling is communicated from the supreme leader of the Taliban, Mohammed Omar, that absolutely no exceptions are going to be made. It is time for us to leave."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/20/afghanistan.features11","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2001/sep/20/afghanistan.features11","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"The lesson for the US: money can't buy safety from terrorism","webPublicationDate":"2001-09-15T15:31:12Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2001/sep/15/september11.usa7","fields":{"body":"When security-cleared visitors were taken into the national security agency in Fort Meade, Maryland, their hosts, it is reported, used to play them an audio tape of Osama bin Laden talking to his mother. His satellite phone call had been intercepted by the largest and most powerful spy agency on earth. <P>The smug message to outsiders was clear: if we can listen to America's most wanted man making small talk with his family then believe us, he can't use the bathroom without Washington knowing.  <P>But the NSA has probably stopped showing off like that. For this story demonstrates the US problem; they and their western allies possess a unique array of surveillance technology which became ultimately pointless. And the west's great intelligence failure will outclass Pearl Harbour in the history books.  <P>Stella Rimington, a former head of MI5, has observed this week in her memoirs that the purpose of counter-terrorism is not to take snapshots of their enemies' activities, or even to successfully trace the perpetrators, but to thwart attacks.   <P>British ministers seemed to be attracted yesterday to the ideas of identity cards and more surveillance of ordinary citizens. But to stop terrorist attacks, the holy grail is something else: intelligence of the enemy's actual intentions.  <P>US intelligence has a budget approaching $30bn (&#163;21bn) - roughly the size of the GDP of Kuwait. It employs more than 100,000 people, and owns vast arrays of hardware.  <P>At the centre is George Tenet. He is the director of central intelligence and the man who coordinates the various US spy agencies. He has huge resources. The espionage agency, the CIA, employs more than 16,000 around the world.  <P>The FBI is one of the largest law enforcement agencies ever; with annual funding of about $3bn, it has 11,400 special agents and more than 16,400 other employees in 55 American cities and abroad. The FBI spends one-sixth of this budget on intelligence gathering alone.  <P>But it is on technology where budgets - quite literally - go through the stratosphere. The existence of the national reconnaissance office (NRO) was declassified only in 1992. With its $6.2bn annual budget, its mission is to run spy satellites - \"spaceborne assets needed to enable US global information superiority\".  <P>The national security agency collects foreign signals intelligence (SIGINT) operates in conjunction with the NRO.   <P>The NSA's 21,000 employees - including the world's largest collection of linguists and mathematicians - are based at Fort Meade, with the rest scattered overseas.  <P>Nine other agencies, ranging from army intelligence (budget $1bn) through to the departments of treasury, energy, transportation (more than $1bn) and the national imagery and mapping agency ($1.2bn) are also involved in intelligence gathering. Add into the equation intelligence work by non-intelligence agencies and the budget exceeds $27bn.    <P><B> Interception</B><BR> <P>The majority of these formidable systems have remained targeted on traditional forms of possible attack by hostile nation states - especially those that might have weapons of mass destruction.  <P>Their efforts are governed by the vast array of technology at their disposal:  <P>&#149;Listening stations: The main allied station in the Middle East is now the British station, Ayios Nikolaos, in eastern Cyprus. Satellite interception antennae are directed at Arab, Turkish and international communications satellites. A listening station in China, run by the German BND intelligence service, stayed operating even after the Tiananmen Square massacre. If it is still operating in the Pamir mountains, it would be the west's most important electronic surveillance asset close to Afghanistan.  <P>&#149;Space surveillance: Satellites orbit the earth every 90 minutes. Some, known as Keyhole, take photographs; others, in the Lacrosse and Vega series, use radar to obtain images through cloud and at night.  <P>All relay their information immediately to Washington.These satellites can obtain pictures of training camps, using infra-red or heat photography to determine whether camps are occupied. Modern commercial imaging satellites can detect one-metre objects. Spy satellites are about ten times more powerful. But only four of these hugely expensive satellites, which are easy to spot, may be in orbit at once.  <P>&#149;Listening satellites: Another network of between eight and 12 satellites intercept signals from the earth's surface. Menwith Hill, in Yorkshire, is the largest electronic surveillance field station in the world. It directs and controls a constellation of listening satellites now directed mainly at the Middle East. The dominant feature of the station, which employs dozens of Arabic, Farsi and Hebrew linguists, is an array of 29 giant, white golfball-like radomes, each of which hide a satellite-tracking antenna.  <P>Launched into high fixed orbits about 40,000km above the earth, secret SIGINT satellites called Vortex, Magnum, Mercury and Orion unfurl listening dishes over 50 metres in diameter. These satellites can intercept and relay low-powered radio signals, including mobile phones. They can also discriminate between individual operators and radio equipment. <P>&#149;Spy planes: Under the codename \"papermate\", the Royal Australian Air Force sends spy planes over Pakistan to detect nuclear preparations. These missions, which have been mounted from the US Indian Ocean base at Diego Garcia, could be extended to Afghanistan if Pakistan or Iran were willing to cooperate. A sophisticated new system, called Classic Story, can identify individual voices and could flash a warning if a wanted person was heard.   <P>&#149;Echelon: This controversial global monitoring system targets international civil communications channels passing through satellites. At Morwenstow, Cornwall, millions of satellite phone calls, faxes, e-mails and data links are monitored every hour. Information is relayed automatically from Britain to the US. It is highly dependent on sophisticated computer filtering software, called dictionaries, which hold thousands of key words or other templates for selecting messages of interest.  <P>&#149;Internet: Dictionary type systems also monitor the internet. NSA's taps into internet cable are among the spy agency's most sensitive secrets, because they scoop up huge quantities of messages sent by US citizens. The NSA has had to construct databanks capable of holding petabytes of data. Such databanks are up to one million times bigger than an average PC.  <P>&#149;Submarines: The US Navy's special tapping submarine, USS Parche, won special commendations for its work throughout the 1990s. In 2004, the Parche will be replaced by a giant new tapping submarine, the USS Jimmy Carter, which is currently being refitted at a cost of more than $400m. Once in service, the Jimmy Carter will be able to carry large surveillance packages the size of a small bus on to the seabed. It will be equipped to tap modern optical fibre cables.  <P>&#149;Embassies: Most American and many allied embassies and consulates are equipped with \"special collection\" equipment. For many years, the US embassy in Moscow tracked conversations Soviet leaders had from their limousines. Special monitoring equipment can be used to monitor and reconstruct emissions from unprotected computer screens.  <P>Yet this array of technical hardware goes hand in hand with a lack of human intelligence - almost a prerequisite for the uncovering of terrorists' intentions.  <P>Shortly before this week's atrocities in the US, someone who described himself as a former CIA operative wrote a long, bitter account from Peshawar published in Atlantic Monthly. His lament echoed other intelligence men before him. Reuel Marc Gerecht said that the CIA and FBI claims were a myth that they were clandestinely \"picking apart\" Bin Laden's organisation \"limb by limb\".  <P>He said: \"Westerners cannot visit the cinder-block, mud-brick side of the Muslim world - whence Bin Laden's foot soldiers mostly come - without announcing who they are. No case officer stationed in Pakistan can penetrate either the Afghan communities in Peshawar or the north-west frontier's numerous religious schools, which feed manpower and ideas to Bin Laden and the Taliban, and seriously expect to gather useful information about radical Islamic terrorism, let alone recruit foreign agents.  <P>By contrast, a priority for the British and, indeed, most other agencies in engaged in \"humint\", or human intelligence, is long-term penetration.  <P>The dangerous and subtle task of infiltrating, or recruiting informers, in terrorist groups has borne fruit in Northern Ireland where MI5, the RUC and the army's covert group, the force research unit, have penetrated both republican and loyalist paramilitary groups. British soldiers of Irish origin were persuaded to leave the army and spend several years ingratiating themselves with the IRA.  <P>The Israeli intelligence services have also succeeded in recruiting informers among Palestinian groups in the occupied territories and refugee camps, as well among the Palestinian population in Jordan and Syria.    <P><B> Treachery</B><BR> <P>So it is not impossible to use \"lo-tech\" infiltration. One reason why the US became addicted to technology instead was the fear of double-agents and treachery - the Soviet-era molehunts left a long shadow of distrust over human beings. It was thought machines could not lie.  <P>Another reason was given by Mr Gerecht. \"Long-term seeding operations simply didn't occur,\" he said. He quoted one Middle East CIA man describing Non-official covert placements: \"NOCs haven't really changed at all since the Cold War... We're still a group of fake businessmen who live in big houses overseas. We don't go to mosques and pray.\" The reason? \"Operations that include diarrhoea as a way of life don't happen.\"  <P>As if to compound the west's flawed commitment to technology at the expense of potentially crucial \"lo-tech\" infiltration, at the other end of the earth things are very different.  <P>When Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl was told to deliver two letters from Pakistan to Cairo he was given simple instructions, as well as a false passport. Shave off your beard, wear western clothes, carry cigarettes and make sure you smell of cologne. The perfume, he was told, would convince Egyptian airport officials that here was a man who liked women.  <P>Acting this way against US intelligence, Bin Laden and his followers look decidedly lo-tech. Yet an operation of some magnitude, involving more than 50 people and taking up to two years in the making, evaded the vast intelligence resources of the greatest power on earth. Al-Fadl, 38, from Sudan, was giving his testimony earlier this year in the southern district court of New York, a few blocks away from the World Trade Centre. As one of very few defectors from al-Qaida, the Islamic revolutionary group formed in Afghanistan 12 years ago by Bin Laden, Al-Fadl's evidence cast a fascinating insight into the complex, by turns primitive and sophisticated network, that Bin Laden and his fellow mojahedins spawned. He was a witness in the trial of four men since found guilty of taking part in the bombing of the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998.    <P><B> Swearing to obey</B><BR> <P>Al-Fadl, who left Sudan for the US in 1986, was recruited by the emir of the Farouq Mosque in New York, who reported to a headquarters in Pakistan. As one of the first volunteers to join al-Qaida, he saw how the charismatic Bin Laden - sometimes called \"the director\" - enjoyed the confidence of militants from across the Arab and Muslim world.  <P>On the ruling shura council there were members from Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Iraq, Oman and Libya. Members, who signed a contract, or  bayat , swearing to obey orders and be ready at all times, were recruited, often at senior levels, in fundamentalist groups across the Middle East.  <P>Fighters and money were given to groups in Chechnya, Azerbaijan, the Phillipines, Eritrea, Somalia and Tajikistan. A London office was opened in 1994 and one member had a bank account at Barclays. Other accounts were held in Dubai, Malaysia and Hong Kong.  <P>After the Russian withdrawal in 1989 and Bin Laden's relocation to the Sudan, al-Qaida owned farms, import and export businesses, and a construction company. But the real object was to export revolution, to set up true Islamic governments and overthrow the rich and corrupt regimes of the Gulf.  <P>With such a wide network of contacts, with trusted members such as Al-Fadl always on the move, carrying coded messages and money, it is easy to see how difficult it was for the might of western intelligence to keep track of this hydra-headed phenomena.  <P>There was, from the start, a sort of structure. Beneath the shura council were four committees. The military committee acquired and exported arms and ran an electronics workshop. Finance organised travel arrangements, false documents and salaries. There was a newsletter produced by the media committee and a fatwa committee which delivered judgments on issues of the day.  <P>On two occasions the military committee shipped consignments of AK47s from   Sudan to the outlawed jihad movement in Egypt. There was a simple solution - as simple as boarding an internal US flight carrying a penknife. Fifty camels were bought at a local market at Umduhrman near Khartoum and the guns were trudged across the open desert.  <P>So important messages were often delivered face to face. In Sudan the intelligence service provided al-Qaida with a radio system. Bin Laden had a $80,000 portable INMARSAT phone from Germany which transmits and receives calls over satellites owned by the International Maritime Satellite Organisation.  <P>US intelligence officials say Bin Laden is well aware they can eavesdrop on his international communications but he does not care. When Bin Laden wants to make sure his communications are secure, one technique is by sending encrypted messages through the internet.  <P>Another informant who gave evidence at the embassy bombing trial was L'Houssaine Kherchtou, a Morroccan, who described how he was trained in reconnaisance techniques, including using tiny cameras discreetly \"without using the camera straight in your eyes\".  <P>Kherchtou, who was recruited at an Islamic cultural centre in Milan, was also sent to Kenya to train to be a pilot. Although it never came to pass, he was told he would be Bin Laden's personal pilot. Trained pilots were clearly not readily on hand for Bin Laden.  <P>It was clear from the trial evidence that the members of al-Qaida shared strong, personal bonds, even if there was resent ment that the many Egyptians in the group were paid more than the others.  <P>There was a keen awareness of the possibility of infiltrators and informers; people who turned up in Sudan and later Afghanistan were rigorously vetted.  <P>That too, may explain why the US authorities, with all its fancy technology, and the intelligence input from its allies in the Middle East - Egypt, Morroco, Jordan, Israel, and Saudi Arabia - were unaware of the 50 conspirators on American soil plotting a terrible outrage.   <P>In Northern Ireland the IRA and Real IRA have relied on \"cleanskins\" - people with no past record, unknown to the security or law enforcement agencies - to organise terrorist attacks. This was also clearly the case with those involved in the attacks in the US.  <P> <B> The hi-tech US</B><BR> &#149; Central Intelligence Agency (espionage): $3.1bn (&#163;2.1bn) budget<BR> &#149; Federal Bureau of Investigation (investigators): $3bn budget <BR>&#149; National Security Agency (radio eavesdropping): $3.6bn budget <BR>&#149; National Reconnaissance Office (spy satellites): $6.2bn budget <BR><BR><B> Intelligence methods</B> <BR> &#149; Satellite cameras<BR> &#149; Spy planes<BR> &#149; Submarines<BR> &#149; Code-breaking<BR> &#149; Radio intercepts<BR> &#149; Internet intercepts<BR> &#149; Phone and fax intercepts <BR><BR> <B> The low-tech terrorists</B><BR> &#149; Osama bin Laden: $205m estimated net wealth plus business enterprises and wealthy Gulf backers<BR><BR> <B> Counter-intelligence methods</B><BR> &#149; Loose-knit network without even a cell structure across dozens of countries<BR> &#149; Not easily infiltrated <BR>&#149; Important communications in internet code, or by hand  <BR>&#149; Adapt simple solutions <BR> &#149; Suicide bombers need no escape route<BR>&#149; Take the long view; laborious training <BR>&#149; Ambitious plans unimaginable to opponents.<P>Duncan Campbell is the investigative journalist and not the Guardian's Los Angeles correspondent of the same name"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/15/september11.usa7","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2001/sep/15/september11.usa7","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"This is Britain's moment","webPublicationDate":"2001-09-12T23:28:24Z","sectionId":"us-news","id":"world/2001/sep/13/september11.politics","fields":{"body":"Not long ago, I bumped into a very senior British military officer at a conference in Europe on international security. The more the US demonised Osama bin Laden, he said, the more support he will attract in the Arab world, particularly among the younger generation. <P>It was not a comment in favour of appeasement, of accepting the inevitability of extreme Islamist terrorism. Far from it. It was a pragmatic remark from a military man deeply concerned about the direction of American policy on the Middle East.  <P>The point was made another way yesterday by Martin Shaw, professor of international relations and politics at Sussex University. \"It may be a little too simple to say that America is paying the price for Ariel Sharon, and for Bush's willingness to see the last vestiges of the peace process disappear in the blood of both Palestinians and Israelis,\" he said. \"But the longer failure of American policy in the Middle East cannot be taken out of the equation, and almost everyone except the Israeli and American political classes knows that this is the case.\"  <P>The almost nonchalant arrogance of the world's only superpower and its lack of engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict fed opposition to the \"Great Satan\", not only among the diaspora of veterans who fought (with the help of CIA money and weapons) against Soviet forces in Afghanistan through the 1980s.  <P>Bin Laden became a kind of folk hero for many who had little idea of the depths of his ruthlessness and hatred of the US and - if the speculation is true - what he and his al-Qaida network was capable of planning with the help of suicidal zealots.  <P>Nor, it appears, did Arab states still classified by the US as \"rogue states\" but whose governments are now worried about their own safety. Syria condemned the attacks and the Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami, offered \"deep sympathy\" to the American people.  <P>Even before the election of President Bush, there was deep-seated, but unstated, concern about US policy throughout Whitehall - in the Ministry of Defence as well as the Foreign Office. Officials not known for their squeamishness reacted furiously to the Clinton administration's decision to bomb southern Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum after the attacks on American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998.  <P>In the British government's view - although ministers did not say so publicly of course - the retaliation was entirely counter-productive. Tony Blair again insisted yesterday that Britain stood \"shoulder to shoulder\" with the US, but his top officials are advising him to urge Bush to be cautious in his response to the terrorist atrocities.  <P>And though they do not yet go so far, even in private, as to oppose sanctions against   Afghanistan and Iraq, senior Whitehall officials say it is in Britain's strategic national interest to engage with \"rogue states\", mentioning in particular Iran, Libya and North Korea. That is the way to deal with a growing potential threat, which everyone acknowledges, from the proliferation of missile technology.  <P>This approach is reflected above all in the deep-seated opposition in Whitehall, as well as among Labour MPs, to the Bush administration's missile defence project. In an interview with the Guardian this summer, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, chief of the defence staff, was extremely sceptical about whether the technology would work. He added: \"There's no point in completely impoverishing ourselves in order to provide ourselves with a defence against one particular system and not being able to do anything else\".  <P>Long-range missiles can be fired only by states. None of the \"rogue states\" the Bush administration says its missile defence plan is designed to deter is likely to launch such a projectile when the point of launch can be easily identified. It is deeply depressing that the attacks in New York and Washington may secure congressional approval for a project which could have done nothing to stop them, or, as so many independent com mentators have repeatedly said, a biological or chemical bomb in a suitcase.  <P>Britain - with its close relationship with the US, driven home in public by ministers, but questioned in private in Whitehall - could well become a target for terrorists. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, admits it would be if Washington goes ahead with its missile defence project. Fylingdales and Menwith Hill would most likely play a key role in the project.  <P>The potential vulnerability to terrorism of other bases was underlined yesterday when US F-15 aircraft were returned to their reinforced shelters at Lakenheath in Suffolk, a base with some 30 nuclear warheads.  <P>Tuesday's atrocities, Whitehall hopes, will encourage Washington to engage more sensibly with the rest of the world.   <P>In his Guardian interview, Sir Michael said pointedly: \"We must be sensible about how we work with &#91;Russia and China&#93;, we - the west in general - and the Americans in particular.\"  <P>Moscow is as concerned with extreme Islamist terrorism as the US. One reason for the close relationship between Russia and Iran is that they share a common enemy, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.  <P>Instead of simply cuddling up to the US, Blair should seize the opportunity to take the lead, with the EU, in the Middle East. It would be good for the region if Europe is supported by a chastened America; disastrous if a vengeful US continues to go its own way, with Blair meekly tagging on.  <P> <A HREF=\"mailto:richard.norton-taylor@guardian.co.uk\">richard.norton-taylor@guardian.co.uk</A>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/13/september11.politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2001/sep/13/september11.politics","sectionName":"US news"},{"webTitle":"Profile: Ursula Owen","webPublicationDate":"2001-07-21T01:54:18Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/2001/jul/21/pressandpublishing.politicsphilosophyandsociety","fields":{"body":"<p>A few weeks before Ursula Owen was born, her mother travelled from Berlin to Oxford. It was 1937, and the Sachs family knew that Hitler's Germany was no place to bring a Jewish child into the world. Emma Sachs spent six weeks in Oxford, where she gave birth to Ursula, recovered, and enjoyed the strange calm of a country whose leading newspaper, the Times, was too busy discussing the plight of laburnum trees to contemplate a Holocaust in the making. Four years earlier, Emma had travelled to Leeds to give birth to her son, Peter. </p><p>Emma and Werner Sachs were informed, educated and organised. They were also very anxious. Werner's family company prepared metal used in the manufacture of armour-piercing bullets, and it was forcibly taken over by the Nazis. Baby Ursula was taken back to Germany, and after a while her parents left her with her grandparents and went to Britain to set up home. Werner, a chemical engineer, attempted to start a new business and the couple converted to Christianity. In August 1938, after Chamberlain had come back from Germany waving his piece of paper promising peace in our time, an Aryan maid took Ursula and her brother across the Dutch-German border. Their father was waiting for them on the Dutch side.  </p><p>The editor and publisher Ursula Owen has always considered herself an outsider. A very English German, a very Jewish Christian, a radical in a conservative world, a conservative in a radical world. Owen has often wanted to belong, to be quietly accepted. At the same time, part of her has always laughed, or scowled, in the face of convention.  </p><p>Mark Fisher, the Labour MP and a former lover of Owen, says: \"She's deeply shaped by her past. Her attempts to assimilate and become English affected her almost as much as the external events of the past. There is a permanent tension in Ursula of wanting to conform and be part of something and yet her critical intelligence always pulls her away from that. She wants to be invited to the party and have the right not only not to go, but to criticise it if she does turn up. The tension between these two things make her curious, provocative and delightful.\"  </p><p>Owen made her name, in her late 30s, as a co-founder of Virago. The women's publishing house - there were no men on the editorial staff and virtually all the books published were by women - electrified the book world in the mid-70s before imploding in a thousand recriminations. At its peak, Virago provided a platform for previously unknown or silenced voices such as Maya Angelou, Willa Cather, Margaret Atwood and Angela Carter.  </p><p>During the past seven years Owen has amplified a different kind of silenced voice, as executive editor-in-chief of the magazine Index on Censorship, overseeing management and editorial content. She took over Index after communism collapsed and at a time when people questioned the need for a journal dedicated to free speech. Owen has smartened up the magazine and subtly extended its remit to show that it is not just the ideological behemoths of fascism and totalitarian communism that silence. The current issue, its 200th, examines racism in Europe, the rise of hate music, and demonstrates how the US prison system has much in common with Stalin's gulags.  </p><p>Owen, now 64, is looking over the anniversary edition of Index. She says it's got good, strong stuff in it but would prefer it if a few of the pieces had run at greater length. She is recovering from breast cancer and has been off work for six months. This is the first issue that she has had nothing to do with, and she regrets it.  </p><p>She is sitting on her sofa, an imposing figure dressed in black jeans and T-shirt, one ankle under her thigh. Her size eight feet are bare. There is something Amazonian about Owen: her size, her laughter, her passions. The walls are covered with bookshelves and photographs. In the corner of the room is a grand piano. By its side is a fine, sculpted head.  </p><p>Owen is explaining the four functions of Index. \"We monitor violations of free expression all over the world; we publish banned writing; we get behind the news - more of our readers say this is what they read us for than anything else; and finally, we see ourselves as a place for debate because I see free expression is a deeply problematic matter, especially in this country where it's looked at with great suspicion.\"  </p><p>Owen is no absolutist. Take hate speech, she says: that's where it gets really tricky. \"To put it simply, do I believe that free expression is worth 100,000 deaths in Rwanda? As people now know, on Radio Mille Collines &#91;the private radio station run by Hutu extremists&#93; journalists went on and said turn right and turn left and go to the next crossroads, and there are 30 people to kill.\" She shakes her head uncertainly, says it's so complex, but that ultimately, the important thing is to talk about it. \"I'm 99% certain I'd go with free expression probably to the bitter end, but I think there has to be a conversation about it.\"  </p><p>When Index advertised for an editor-in-chief, there were three criteria: the right candidate must have worked as a journalist, must have worked in human rights, and must have edited a newspaper or magazine. Owen fulfilled none of the requirements.  </p><p>Judith Vidal-Hall, editor of Index, helped appoint her. \"Despite everything, she was so obviously the right person. What Index needed was somebody with business sense; we needed professionals rather than terribly nice, good people.\" She adds that Index had for too long been trapped in a commercially unviable ghetto. \"We had 2,000 committed readers. Now we print 15,000.\" The magazine, which is distributed worldwide and was previously bi-monthly, has just become a quarterly and looks much more like Granta than the shabby publication of old.  </p><p>Vidal-Hall says there has been a huge culture change at Index. \"The old certainties of the cold war are just not there any more. Everything is much more fragmented. Together we've broadened the interpretation into anything that silences.\" So today they are much more likely to examine cause rather than effect - xenophobia, racism, poverty, technology, the media. There is also more space given to the experience of women. \"I think Ursula's feminism informs Index,\" says Vidal-Hall. \"There is much more of a woman's voice than before, and rightly so,\" There   is also more room for disagreement. She is quick to add that she is convinced Index will lose readers if they run the longer pieces Owen is so keen on. \"Remember, for many of our readers, English is not their first language.\"  </p><p>Vidal-Hall says Owen is \"feisty, positive and opinionated in the best sense - an enormously warm and generous woman. And she likes to be in charge.\" Six months after Owen took over, she told Vidal-Hall something was bothering her. \"She said to me, 'You want my job, don't you?' I said, 'Absolutely not. I've been a managing editor and it destroyed me'.\" Vidal-Hall says that ever since then, they have got on well.  </p><p>\"I admit it, I am very controlling,\" Owen says. It's funny, she adds, that as a child and young woman she was so diffident, always apologising for her existence. At home, her parents spoke only German, while she was made to answer in English. Her father established a successful metal company that went on to become a multinational. He was famous for his organisation and his temper, which Owen's friends say she has inherited. Her mother was a talented violinist - at home they played chamber music with Werner on flute, brother Peter on cello and Ursula on piano. Both parents clung to their guttural accents and German mannerisms while urging their elder daughter to become a model English rose. \"They never made the slightest attempt to be English themselves, but I think they wanted us to belong and we were very good at it.\"  </p><p>Owen made for an unlikely English rose with her dark, handsome features. She was sent to Putney High, a conservative direct grant school, and ordered to fit in. Which she dutifully did. She became deputy head girl, captain of the hockey team, star pianist and won a place at Oxford.  </p><p>Meanwhile, she continued to doubt herself. Her sister, Ruth, seven years younger, says: \"She was a protective big sister. Actually, she was slightly anxious about things, always wanting to make things safer. She's much more confident now than as a child.\" Owen obsessed about shutting windows, about numbers. But above all, she was anxious about her mother, who developed severe mental illness in her early forties. Despite Owen's achievements, she continued to feel like a failure at school. She saw herself as a good girl rather than a bright girl. She sensed that her father, with his wealth and academic accomplishment, was disappointed in her. She felt vulnerable; that she had one skin too few.  </p><p>Ruth says: \"There were always these expectations that she would do well, and she was weighed down by them. You have to remember that my parents were in their mid-30s when they moved here and they wanted the very best for their children. There was an anxiety, a need to know that the children were going to be all right.\"  </p><p>The word anxiety comes up over and over again. Owen describes her mother as \"probably the most anxious person I've met in my life\". Emma was diagnosed as schizophrenic several times, and certified. \"My mother spent 12 years more in than out of mental hospitals, and at the end of that, their marriage broke up. She went through everything - ECT, insulin treatment - and she survived it. What she did was lead a life that she could cope with. It's only since she died three years ago that I've realised the level of struggle and the heroism, really.\"  </p><p>Owen says she was in a daze by the time she got to Oxford to study medicine. Her mother was so ill, and she was terrified she would inherit her sickness. She felt she was shallow, without an opinion to her name. But university transformed her. She suddenly found herself stimulated by students taking to the streets to protest about Hungary and Suez. \"Within six weeks I was radicalised.\" She made friends with a small group of women, discovered socialism and for the first time in her life she felt worthwhile.  </p><p>Just before graduating, the group discussed what they wanted to do with their lives. There was a choice - to be good (to work and do good deeds) or to be happy (to marry and have children). Her three friends dedicated themselves to goodness, while Ursula whispered, for fear of being excluded from the group, that she wanted to be happy. At Oxford, she became engaged to fellow student Roger Owen, and they married soon after graduating. After 10 years of failing to conceive, they adopted a nine-day-old girl, Kate.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Ursula gave up on medicine and qualified as a social worker, then a psychiatric social worker. \"I'm sure I became a psychiatric social worker partly to try and deal with the whole mental illness thing. I was deeply preoccupied with it till I was about 40, which was about the age my mother started getting ill. I was afraid of getting mentally ill. I think I really grappled with it, and one of the ways I did was to plunge myself into a mental hospital. Which I suppose is something I tend to do - just plunge myself in.\"  </p><p>Owen also travelled with Roger, a historian. They spent a year in New York, a year in Cairo, a year in Beirut. She was liberated by New York, a city where all sorts of people were trying all sorts of things without necessarily being very good at them. \"Until then I'd always felt that if you didn't have a first from Balliol, and especially if you weren't a man, you weren't encouraged to try things.\" She briefly considered becoming a sculptor. Owen points out the sculpted head in the corner of the room. \"That's one of mine.\"  </p><p>The Middle East liberated her in a different way. \"Being in Egypt gave me an extraordinary sense of what hospitality was. We were both teaching English, and there was something about the expansiveness of the people; they were incredibly generous.\"  </p><p>It was soon after she returned to England from Beirut at the age of 32 that she developed a life-threatening illness. Her dentist noticed a lump in her mouth and she was diagnosed with an extremely rare condition, myxoma of the jaw, that was eating her mouth away. When they removed the bandages after the operation, she discovered that her upper jaw had been removed. \"They asked me a question and when I spoke I sounded as if I had a cleft palate. They were sweet people but nobody had thought to tell me that I wouldn't be able to speak properly at first, and that it would be OK because they'd give me a plastic upper jaw.\" When she talks, you can see the metal clasps of her plate at the corners of her mouth. \"This hole in my mouth was a source of huge amusement for my daughter and then my granddaughter. Both fall about laughing when they see it.\"  </p><p>She puts on more coffee. Four months after her mastectomy, Owen says she's still feeling woozy and a bit forgetful from the anaesthetic. Her prognosis is good, but she says the cancer has changed her. \"It's a peculiar illness, it's like an animal, you don't know what it's doing, and it creeps up on you. You think it may go away, but you're somehow living with it for the rest of your life, and that gives you a different take on life.\"  </p><p>Her daughter, Kate, now 31 and a primary school teacher, says: \"I've always thought of her as strong and positive, but I don't know how she's got over this. She seemed to be more worried about me than herself. She was always asking me if I was OK, and pleading with me to call people and talk things through. I was devastated, but she was very matter of fact. As long as she's got all the information, she can deal with it. If she's not got the information, she wobbles. When everything was crumbling around her, she was always there for me.\"  </p><p>And plenty has crumbled around Ursula Owen. Not least relationships. Eighteen months after Kate was adopted, Ursula and Roger split up. Since then Owen has had a series of long-term relationships; with politicians Mark Fisher and Stuart Holland, and, for 17 years, with the literary critic Bill Webb. For the past four years, she has been with the critic Frank Kermode. He has a Cambridge home while she continues to live in the north London house that has been her home for 30 years. \"I absolutely long for permanence,\" she says. \"Part of me would love to have had one relationship that lasted, but I also think I'm quite complicated about space.\"  </p><p>In her 30s, and now with a child, Owen settled back in London and wandered into publishing, working first for academic publications and then as an editor for Christopher MacLehose at Barrie &amp; Jenkins. At first, publishing was just a job. She had no idea it would become a passion. In 1974, she was asked by Carmen Callil whether she was interested in starting a women's publishing house. \"At that time we were probably the only two feminists in publishing.\" Callil had already registered the name Virago.  </p><p>Harriet Spicer, now head of the national lottery commission, joined them as the office junior. \"Ursula has this great wide smile. You always get a sense that even if she doesn't hug you, she comes towards you - a sense that her whole self is there,\" says Spicer.  </p><p>It's now almost impossible to get people to talk objectively about Virago these days. The final split was so acrimonious - Callil and Owen haven't spoken to each other for many years - that many people are unwilling or incapable of remembering the glory.  </p><p>In 1976, Virago became self-financing and independent with capital of just &#163;1,500 and a loan of &#163;10,000. Initially, Callil and Owen's skills complemented each other. While Callil developed the modern classics list, Owen developed the non-fiction line, notably the travel series, but both also discovered new novelists - Owen brought Maya Angelou to the UK, after British publishers had rejected her for years. Callil and Owen also had good contacts in the academic and business worlds, which helped to secure bank loans to finance the company. \"Like it or not, the symbiosis between the two at the beginning is what kicked the thing into life,\" Spicer says.  </p><p>Alexandra Pringle was the fourth to join Virago, replacing Spicer. \"I was the office slave,\" Pringle says, \"and Ursula was a sort of mother. She has a huge personality, an enormous zest for life. You can endlessly talk about life with Ursula... things that happen, our motivations. I remember after a day's work I'd just want a stiff drink and she'd want a huge meal. She's a woman with big appetites in every way.\"  </p><p>Pringle says Virago was as much the creation of Owen's as of Callil's. \"Editorially, at the beginning Carmen's contribution was the modern classics. But the new list, both fiction and non-fiction, were Ursula. She contributed the more radical books.\"  </p><p>Owen says they were mad times. \"We put our houses in hock to this company. I had a two-year-old, I must have been crazy.\" Even then, despite the new confidence, she still found herself apologising. \"I'd apologise for getting things wrong, thinking I'd offended people. People got very irritated. Friends in the women's movement said I wish you'd stop apologising.\" More than anything, Owen says, Virago taught her that you can't go through life being liked by everybody.  </p><p>\"She can be fiercely angry,\" Spicer says. \"She's good at expressing anger. She bellows. If you're going to be successful in business, you have to have a strong sense of entitlement, of what is your due.\"  </p><p>The anthropologist Hugh Brody, who has known Owen for 30 years, says she takes her friendships very seriously indeed. \"She expects a lot of it, and if it goes wrong she takes getting it right very seriously. Friendship with Ursula is exciting and demanding. She doesn't slide over things, doesn't do that genteel English thing of disregarding difficulty. She confronts.\"  </p><p>Brody says Owen burns with life. \"There is something about the intelligence of her intensity, and the intensity of her intelligence. Intensity can be compelling, but it is not always intelligent. I still remember a time we fell out. It was an argument over Marxism. I remember every detail about the falling out, but not the actual content of the argument. It was very disturbing and took several weeks to repair.\"  </p><p>Virago, with its bookshop carousels displaying the distinctive green-spined paperbacks, dominated the independent bookshops in the late 70s and 80s. \"It was fantastically nice to be part of a success story,\" Owen says. \"Heavenly. Incredibly nice. There were deeply wonderful things, like young women coming up to you saying, 'I walk into bookshops and there's a wall of women's books'. Then there's just the vanity thing... it was nice.\"  </p><p>But success made for conflict. There were arguments with feminists who thought Virago was too corporate, too middle class, and the books were too expensive. There were arguments with some feminists who didn't think women's writing should be confined to a ghetto. At home, there were arguments as personal lives were forced to come second to the publishing house. Spicer says: \"There was a notional medal struck for the partner of everybody who worked at Virago.\" And most poisonously, there were arguments between themselves.  </p><p>Spicer says: \"When you have such an intense working life, when anything begins to loosen, the power that held you together is going to be equal and opposite when you hurl yourself in other directions.\"  </p><p>By the late 70s, there were already tensions between Owen and Callil which intensified over the next five years. In 1982, Callil left to become managing director of Chatto and Windus, remaining chairwoman of Virago, and Virago was taken over by the Cape, Chatto and Bodley Head group. Owen and Spicer became joint managing directors of Virago. Virago regained its independence after five women (Owen, Callil, Spicer, Pringle and Lennie Goodings) completed a management buyout in 1987. Three years later, Owen quit and became non-executive director. Finally, in 1995, after a bitter row, Virago was sold to Little, Brown, where it exists as an imprint.  </p><p>\"Envy is the great unmentionable, the great taboo subject,\" Owen says. \"Virago was an amazing place to work, but we were just human beings like everyone else so there was ambition, greed, love, hate, like everywhere else.\" And envy remains the great unmentionable. Owen refuses to be more specific.  </p><p>When asked whether she would like to contribute to this profile, Callil said: \"No, I certainly don't. I literally don't have a good word to say about her.\" She quickly changes her mind on both counts.  </p><p>\"The crucial problem was the work. She always wanted to run it. That's all I can say. It's 2001 and it's all a long time ago. It wasn't a happy parting.\" She pauses. \"What she does now she seems to do very well. I'm being as kind as I can, granted that I feel she hurt me terribly.\"  </p><p>Were they really unhappy days? Pringle says: \"They were hell, but they were interesting. It was so intense, we were a young company, we worked around the clock. We operated on a shoestring, having to save every stamp, every staple, every envelope.\" Harriet Spicer says: \"Whenever things get bad at the lottery, I always comfort myself with the fact they can't get as bad as they were at Virago.\" She says it was particularly tough for Owen. \"Ursula had a very difficult time, being the only one with a young child. She got sympathy, but no empathy. The work/life balance there was completely wrong.\"  </p><p>Former Virago colleagues say they don't understand how Callil says she was hurt by Owen. They will only comment on the feud off the record, saying that at its simplest, Callil envied Owen's personal life, while Owen envied Callil's public profile.  </p><p>\"Envy, greed, ambition, love, hate,\" Owen repeats, saying that is the stuff that splits any business, regardless of whether it is run by men or women. Were they jealous of each other? \"If I were to put it in a nutshell, she thought I took up too much space. I think there was probably envy on both sides. I think she thought it was her baby. I was quite important to Virago, and I think she found that difficult.\"  </p><p>How was she envious of Callil? \"I think I found it difficult at the beginning that she was very much the media figurehead in the early days. You know, there's lots of stuff.\"  </p><p>Was the problem a clash of two big egos? \"Yes, yes. I'm not sure the ego was the only problem. Yes, I think we both had big egos... I don't think my ego's ever been overweening.\"  </p><p>But, says Owen, that was a lifetime ago, and now she'd rather remember the achievements. \"This is going to sound very sentimental, but I remember an American publisher saying you walk into that office and everyone is totally engaged with what they're doing. It was the speediness of it as well; the quick-wittedness. There was just so much energy.\"  </p><p>After quitting Virago in 1990, Owen worked for the shadow arts department under Mark Fisher, with the grand title of cultural policy adviser to the Labour Party. She advised them on the presentation of their ideas, published books reflecting the Party's cultural policy, and fell in love with Fisher. This caused another huge split in Owen's life. She finally finished her 17-year relationship with Bill Webb, and Fisher left his wife and four children. Three years later, Owen and Fisher split up.</p><p>While Index has never inflamed passions like Virago, it has fulfilled Owen. Her daughter Kate says: \"Index is her second baby without a doubt. When I was living with her a couple of years ago, she was never in. She'd always be out at a party or a conference. She thrives on the work. I said please slow down, you're doing too much. I just had a feeling. And then she got very ill.\"  </p><p>Owen has travelled through many of the problematic countries covered by Index: Bosnia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Kenya and Russia. But, she says, in her own way she has slowed down. She is calmer these days, she doesn't apologise, she's less anxious, she no longer worries about not fitting in.  </p><p>Alexandra Pringle, who also went to the same school as Owen, says women tend to take longer to grow into themselves than men; to feel happy about themselves. \"It often comes in middle age, and that's happened to Ursula. It's lovely to see it. She may have wanted to conform, but she never followed a prescribed path, unlike the incredibly boring girls at school. She has become less conformist as she's got older.\"  </p><p>These days Owen embraces her multitudes - Judaism, Christianity, Englishness, Germanness, her desire for permanence, her fear of petrification, her few certainties, her many questions. She says it's a long time since she felt she was on probation in England, but, of course, as a daughter of Jewish refugees, she is still an outsider. She wouldn't have it any other way.</p><p><strong> Ursula Margaret Owen </strong></p><p><strong>Born: </strong>21 Jan 1937, Oxford, England.  </p><p><strong>Education: </strong>Putney High School; St Hugh's, Oxford; Bedford College, London.  </p><p><strong>Married: </strong>Roger Owen, 1960-1972, one daughter (Kate).   </p><p><strong>Career: </strong>psychiatric social worker and researcher 1960-1970; editor at Frank Cass 1971-73; editor at Barrie &amp; Jenkins 1973-74; founder-director and editorial director at Virago; from 1982, joint managing director 1974-90; cultural policy adviser to the Labour party 1990-92; editor-in-chief, Index on Censorship1993-.  </p><p><strong>Publications edited: </strong>Reflections by Daughters (Virago, 1984); Whose Cities?

There would be no denying his crowd-pleasing talent, but none either that his brilliance did not go hand-in-hand with consistency. </p><p>The gifted underachiever tag is no longer justified. If McRae takes the Safari Rally in Kenya on Sunday he will become the first driver to win 24 world championship rallies, the first to win four in a row since 1985, and the holder of a clear lead in the championship. Despite Tommi Makinen's four world titles with Mitsubishi compared with the Scot's one, McRae could reasonably claim to be the world's best driver.  </p><p>At times he has been truculent, impetuous, even lazy; too ready to assume that talent is a substitute for testing and too reluctant to settle for anything less than victory. It is entirely in character that all his points this year have come from wins.  </p><p>But even in mediocre years he has won rallies. He is equally at home in all conditions and, thanks to a shattering turn of speed and a limitless capacity to absorb pressure, he has an unsurpassed knack of gaining the upper hand in close finishes.  </p><p>It is impossible to completely disentangle car from driver, but it is safe to say that Ford were primarily responsible for his soul-destroying 1999 and 2000 seasons when he joined them from Subaru. However, those failures also prompted the thought that choosing the right car is as important a skill as being able to drive it.  </p><p>The Ford Focus was new and desperately short of development. Its finishing record was predictably awful and McRae found himself in the familiar position of coping with fragile sophistication while reliability paid off for his rivals.  </p><p>\"All this new stuff is brilliant when it works but when it goes wrong it's a disaster. You've got to find a balance, and that was partly the problem at Subaru the last three years,\" he said. \"They were really pushing the technology side a bit too hard instead of sticking with the reliable solution, like Mitsubishi did - like Mitsubishi still have. They haven't got any semi-automatic gearboxes or launch controls or fancy anti-lag &#91;turbocharger&#93; systems. The car is still very, very simple and it works. It may not be the   quickest on every rally but it's certainly there on every rally. I think at the moment that's what wins championships.  </p><p>\"If you're losing through technology going wrong on you, there's more pressure on you not to make mistakes, because when the car's actually right it's so important to get the points in.\"  </p><p>McRae's dire results extended well into 2001, but in the past two months Ford's colossal invest ment since he joined them has borne fruit and their driver could do no wrong.  </p><p>Three successive wins have sent his confidence soaring and it is an indication of his maturity that they have been achieved in distinctly different styles: Argentina was conquered by a blistering assault from the start, Cyprus by hanging back and gaining a tactical advantage from a more favourable position in the running order, and the Acropolis by turning that stategy on its head and deliberately forging ahead.  </p><p>\"We know we can win every rally, really, and of course it has got everybody else on a negative,\" his co-driver Nicky Grist explained.  </p><p>McRae is giving fresh life to the theory that rally drivers are at their best when they are over 30 years old. He became   the youngest world rally champion in 1995 at 27, but the succeeding years have emphasised that experience and temperament play as large a part as pure speed.  </p><p>Paradoxically he has become more formidable as it has dawned on him that his occupation can be dangerous. His horrific crash in Corsica last September, when he was trapped upside down in the   car for 45 minutes with a broken cheekbone, continues to prey on his mind. It is not the thought of getting hurt that bothers him, but the fact that he doesn't know why it happened. He suspects that his rivals do not appreciate the risks they routinely take.  </p><p>\"Maybe &#91;drivers are&#93; quickest before 30 and at their best after 30,\" he said. \"I can still go as quick if I want to, but you're more conscious of the big picture and not just that stage time and beating the car in front of you.\"  </p><p>With seven races left in this year's championship McRae believes only Makinen poses a threat. \"The only driver that there's still a question mark over is Tommi. Richard &#91;Burns&#93; put up quite a strong challenge in Argentina, but when it came right down to it we took time off him in the   last two stages, just to be sure.\"  </p><p>If he could choose the rally at which to go for the record tally of wins, McRae would not nominate the Safari, even though he has won it twice and it is likely to suit the Ford. The last open-road event in the world championship - an echo of motor sport's 19th-century origins - it is the longest, roughest and least predictable rally on the calendar.  </p><p>\"Look what happened to us over the last three rallies: we went from nothing to where we are now. It could just as easily go the other way. I think, to be sure, we've got to win at least another two and obviously have some good finishes.\"  </p><p>McRae is confident but remains to be convinced that Makinen is beaten, or that his Focus is a sure bet. </p><p><strong>Top 10 winners</strong><br /></p><p>Colin McRae (GB)<strong> 23 victories </strong><br /> </p><p>Carlos Sainz (Sp)<strong> 23 </strong><br /> </p><p>Juha Kankkunen (Fin) <strong> 23 </strong><br />  </p><p>Tommi Makinen (Fin)<strong> 22 </strong><br />  </p><p>Didier Auriol (Fr)<strong> 20 </strong><br />  </p><p>Markku Alen (Fin) <strong> 19 </strong><br />   </p><p>Hannu Mikkola (Fin)<strong> 18 </strong><br />  </p><p>Miki Biasion (It) <strong>17 </strong><br />  </p><p>Bjorn Waldegaard (Swe)<strong> 16 </strong><br />  </p><p>Walter Rohrl (Ger) <strong>14 </strong><br /></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2001/jul/18/motorracing.rallying","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2001/jul/18/motorracing.rallying","sectionName":"Sport"},{"webTitle":"Yielding results","webPublicationDate":"2001-06-14T10:59:32Z","sectionId":"science","id":"science/2001/jun/14/research.highereducation","fields":{"body":"<p>By 2020 there will be another two billion people, mainly in the poorest parts of the world. With population growth outpacing the capacity to produce food, agriculture has reached a crossroads. </p><p>Biotechnology has been around since mankind first   experienced the joys of home brewing. Science has sidestepped the species constraints of conventional reproduction to find more useful offspring such as the mule or hybrid crops. Horticulturalists have been modifying the genetic make-up of plants for years, in the hope of creating bigger and better crops.   </p><p>Genetic modification is a more specific way of doing this. Faced with drought, rising temperature and soil infertility, in the years ahead success depends on contemporary science intermingling with traditional methods, to enhance productivity without jeopardising ecological security.  </p><p>This was the issue for researchers gathered at Global Agriculture 2020 at the John Innes Centre in Norwich in April this year.  </p><p>There are many success stories. Dr Luis Herrera-Estrella from Cinvestav, Mexico, is engineering crops to   combat climate change and environmental stresses. Plants are being engineered with \"drought-proofing\" genes or to tolerate salinity by making \"osmoprotectant\" molecules such as trehalose.  </p><p>Others use nutrients more efficiently, reducing fertiliser usage, by excreting organic acids that release phosphorus from metal complexes in infertile acidic soils. Access to new technologies and software tools, can speed up the search for genes involved with stress adaptation, offering novel approaches for crop design.  </p><p>Agriculture provides a   livelihood for 55% of Indians but crops like urd and green gram frequently suffer losses of 70%. Transgenic technology offers a solution. In Mexico, virus-resistant potatoes boosted yields on small-scale farms by 46%, and income by 141%, at no extra cost because the technology was given by industry. And in Kenya, yields were up by 20-25% using sweet potatoes resistant to viruses or insects.  </p><p>Eight million hectares of cotton are cultivated in India, requiring 50% of the country's total pesticide consumption with dire consequences   for the environment, biodiversity and human health. Despite this, rampant pests and diseases reduce yields to half the worldwide average. But, field trials of cotton engineered with a bacterial protein that protects against insect invaders, raised yields by 40-70% and needed fewer pesticides.  </p><p>At Professor Swaminathan's research institute in Madras, organic farming flourishes alongside modern methods. A \"designer potato\" with enhanced amino acid composition has been engineered to improve its nutritional value.   Tobacco that tolerates salinity is a precautionary measure against the rising tides a changing climate will bring. This trait can be engineered into food crops. Biological control methods, such as naturally occurring plant chemicals or the predator-eats-pest scenario, are also used to protect crops.  </p><p>Swaminathan is also encouraging rural communities to embrace new practices to improve farming. But the technological explosion has seen a digital divide develop between those who have access to information technology and the billions in rural regions of developing countries that do not, a kind of \"technological apartheid\" as he calls it.  </p><p>The \"green revolution\" of   the late 1960s avoided widespread famine, largely by introducing high-yielding, modern semi-dwarf varieties of rice and wheat - shorter, stockier plants support the heads of grain better than their lankier relatives. Swaminathan advocates a new, \"evergreen revolution\" through the use of technology, to provide a sustainable global agriculture and a perennial green revolution in which everyone can share, right down to the poorest farmer in the poorest part of the world.  </p><p>Malnutrition affects about 800 million worldwide - in India, 53% children aged under four are underweight, 47-90% are anaemic and millions suffer from vitamin A deficiency. \"Golden rice\" engineered with vitamin A precursors was developed through public funding, not industry, to help reduce blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency. With the sup port of Syngenta, free licences for \"humanitarian use\" were granted for all intellectual property rights and the rice is free for farmers earning less than $10,000.  </p><p>Widely grown, especially    by peasant women, bananas provide 25% of the energy needs for most Kenyans. Declining yields, due to environmental stresses, pests and diseases, threatened food security and income for the   80% of small-scale farmers in Kenya who provide 90% of the country's food. This prompted scientists from the ISAAA AfriCentre, Nairobi, to work with local farmers to offer culturally acceptable solutions. Propagating \"clean\" seedlings in tissue culture, sterile glass pots until they are hardy enough to transplant to the field has boosted yields.  </p><p>Esther Gacaugu is one farmer reaping the rewards - she has ploughed her increased income back into her farm, expanding her orchard. She is now a group leader and distributor of tissue culture-grown plantlets and can afford to educate her children.  </p><p>Progress has always been driven by myriad technological innovations and agriculture faces tough decisions if it is to supply nutritional food to feed eight billion.  </p><p>Together with traditional practices, the advent of   genetic engineering and a wealth of knowledge from genomics resources herald a new renaissance, allowing more food to be produced from less land using less water and fewer chemicals.  </p><p>To the eco-terrorists brandishing their banners shouting \"Save the world\", isn't that what science is in a position to do?  </p><p>But as Professor Alan Gray, from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: \"The future of agriculture may actually depend on the ability of the persuaders.\"  </p><p>&#149;  Dr Claire Cockcroft is at the Institute of Biotechnology, University of Cambridge.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2001/jun/14/research.highereducation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/science/2001/jun/14/research.highereducation","sectionName":"Science"},{"webTitle":"Uganda welcomes private universities","webPublicationDate":"2001-05-23T10:51:07Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2001/may/23/highereducation.uk","fields":{"body":"<p>The government in Uganda has become the latest on the African continent to open its country's doors to educators looking to establish private institutions of higher learning within its jurisdiction.</p><p>Uganda's President, Yoweri Museveni, said recently that his government expects to extend financial support to all private universities because of what he described as their role in the economic growth of the nation.</p><p>However, he did not spell out what form that support would take or any likely restrictions on institutions looking to operate solely as for-profit concerns.</p><p>Mr Museveni also confirmed the government's intention to inaugurate three of its own universities by 2003, which have been established to cope with the surging number of students Uganda is currently experiencing, as a result of its drive for universal learning among the young.</p><p>The president announced the measures at a graduation ceremony for students at the Islamic University in Mbale, where he urged students to pursue more courses in marketable skills, such as new technology, tourism and medicine.</p><p>The East African republic is currently experiencing a dire shortage of doctors and trained medical specialists, at a time when the spectre of an Aids epidemic threatens to engulf swathes of the continent.</p><p>In prosperous nations, said Mr Museveni, \"the majority of jobs are from the private sector, &#91;which&#93; is more efficient because people are motivated.\"</p><p>Uganda is far from being the only African state to be currently flirting with privatised higher learning.

It is a type of rice into which genes for beta-carotene have been inserted - and it is being made to carry a crushing load of ideological baggage in the GM debate. These tiny grains reflect the worst sides of the participants. </p><p>Basic facts are not in dispute. More than 100m children worldwide are affected by vitamin A deficiency. As a consequence, 2m children die each year and 500,000 go permanently blind. They are from the poorest families in the developing countries, with little or no access to the balanced diets we enjoy in the industrialised world.  </p><p>For example, poor families in Asia consume rice as a staple; babies are often weaned on rice gruel. But the rice grain lacks beta-carotene, the precursor of vitamin A. There is plenty in the leaves and stems, but none in the grain endosperm. And no amount of traditional breeding has been able to get it there. (Brown, unmilled rice contains only minute amounts of beta-carotene.)  </p><p>That has now changed as a result of the work of Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. His team has been able to transfer two daffodil and one bacterial gene into rice that will ensure the rice grain contains beta-carotene. It is a classic piece of genetic modification, and that is why the anti-GM activists are so strident in their condemnation. The food industry, which had no part in its development, is also using golden rice for its own ends. It has featured the golden grains as part of a $50m campaign to promote GM foods. The message is that GM is not just about profits, it can save children's lives.  </p><p>All of this hype is premature and dangerous. The science that led us to golden rice is at a very early stage. Until the product is fully developed and tested, no one can be sure how well it will work and whether there may be unwanted side effects. Nor can many of the other promising applications - adding more nutrition to basic staple crops, such as cowpeas and sweet potatoes - be pursued. But some anti-GM activists would like the work to be stopped before we know its real value and are going to extraordinary lengths to rubbish the science   </p><p>Much play has been made of the amounts of rice people would have to eat to gain a full day's supply of vitamin A. But this misses the point that it is a deficiency we have to tackle, not a total lack of vitamin A. No one is suggesting rice should be the only source of vitamin A. Children die or go blind because they do not get enough. The first golden rice varieties, which will be improved, should provide enough beta-carotene to meet 10%-20% of the dietary requirements of a child. In many instances this will keep a child alive.  </p><p>This all sounds worthwhile but, says the opposition, it is a quick fix. We should be working instead on the causes of malnutrition. Of course we are working on those, but changing people's livelihoods and farming patterns takes time. And in the meantime, millions will die or go blind.  </p><p>The insistence on focusing on fundamentals is also in  consistent, if not downright hypocritical. At the Rockefeller Foundation, we are also funding the development of vaccines against HIV in Africa (the first ones are currently being tested in Kenya). Should we stop all efforts at this and devote our funds solely to the attempt to change sexual behaviour or wait until the fundamental problem underlying the Aids   epidemic - grinding poverty - is eliminated? There are alternative ways of dealing with vitamin A deficiency. They are all being tried (we fund some of them), but they all have drawbacks.  </p><p>Giving children twice yearly massive doses of vitamin A in tablet form will greatly reduce mortality. Several countries are doing this, but it is relatively costly and   the poorest children are difficult to reach. Also, the mortality rate can be further reduced if, instead of massive doses, children are given smaller doses every day.  </p><p>Ideally farmers should cultivate diverse kitchen gardens, but in many regions they have to cope with long dry spells during which there are few fruits or vegetables. Besides, researchers have recently found that the beta-carotene available in green, leafy vegetables is much less than previously supposed. The best sources of vitamin A are animal products - butter, cheese, eggs, liver - but they are often out of reach for the poor.  </p><p>While nutritionists disagree on the relative merits of better diets, supplements or fortification, they agree that some combination is needed and multiple tools must be brought to the task.  </p><p>But before Golden Rice can be part of the solution we do need more answers to the   questions raised by anti-GM activists: answers which careful testing can safely provide. First, we need to ensure the grain is freely available to the poor and that it is acceptable; second, that there are no serious environmental consequences from growing golden rice and third, that there are no adverse effects on health. There is no hazard in ingesting excess beta-carotene but we should watch for possible allergies.  </p><p>The potential for saving lives is there and this makes it a moral imperative to seek out the answers. That is why I welcome the recent statement by Benedikt Haerlin of Greenpeace that they will not disrupt testing. I hope that other anti-GM activists will give up a good campaign icon for the sake of hungry children.  </p><p>&#149; Gordon Conway is president of the Rockefeller Foundation. </p><p> <a href=\"mailto:GSoule@rockfound.org\">G.Soule@rockfound.org</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/mar/21/food.gm","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2001/mar/21/food.gm","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"On the Edge CD of the week: David Rothenberg &amp; Douglas Quin: Before the War","webPublicationDate":"2001-03-16T16:32:12Z","sectionId":"culture","id":"lifeandstyle/2001/mar/16/shopping.culture6","fields":{"body":"<p><strong> David Rothenberg &amp; Douglas Quin</strong> Before the War<br /> (EarthEar)   <br />&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;  <br /> </p><p> David Rothenberg is a clarinet player and composer who has made a number of jazz-inflected collaborations and solo albums, including the superb Unamuno (New Tone). He is also a writer and editor, and once put together a CD compilation entitled Music from Nature (an adjunct to the journal Terra Nova for MIT Press). That was an entertaining collection that included a Beethoven piano sonata (No 30), Chris Hughes's Steve Reich-inspired Slow Motion Blackbird, and field recordings of Pygmy women gathering mushrooms. It was pure Late Junction, well before Late Junction was even a twinkle in a Radio 3 controller's eye. </p><p>Before the War features a studio ensemble of Rothenberg, bassist Bill Douglas, drummer Russ Gold and Douglas Quin, a guitarist who has collected a large number of field recordings from Alaska, Kenya, Madagascar and so on. Quin's samples of birds, wind and   water fill out the texture and work in easy dialogue with the percussion. This is not a particularly new concept: composer Basil Kirchin made a couple of extraordinary albums in the early 1970s (Worlds Within Worlds) that featured improvisers such as Evan Parker alongside animal and insect sounds. What is significant about Rothenberg and Quin's ensemble is that technology now permits them to improvise in real time with the natural sounds in Quin's library: perhaps this is the airy rural equivalent of the way super-hip musicians like Julien Lourau use samples and programming as part of a more urban jamming band.  </p><p>The inclusion of a live track, Crabs Who Fall from Tree into the Sea, makes it clear that the group doesn't need studio trickery to generate the forest ambience that underpins the piece. Another piece, Orchid Angels, builds slowly from the sounds of distant birds, a shaker, a low drone and some tentative bass clarinet before easing into a more definite rhythm. Karelian Midnight features the bowed Jouhikko and voice of Mari Jarvinen. Three of the 12 tracks, including Murder in the World and the title track, feature Rothenberg's spoken voice. The sleevenotes quote Woody   Guthrie, John Cage (who said that music should imitate nature by its manner of operation) and Evan Eisenberg, whose \"earth jazz\" concept means players should \"relax their rigid beat and learn to follow nature's rhythms - in other words, to swing\". Whether you trace that idea back to Aristotle or Disney's Jungle Book, it is not a bad way to get in touch with your inner loon. EarthEar's mail-order catalogue includes many recordings that take the idea of \"environmental sound art\" in many different directions, with discs by Chris Watson, Bernie Krause and Annea Lockwood and \"urban soundscapes\" by Michael Rusenberg and Hans Ulrich Werner.  </p><p>Whatever the ecological implications of this vast area of recording and documentation, the Rothenberg/Quin ensemble sound, weaving together understated drums, bass, guitar and environmental samples, provides a new and entirely appropriate setting for jazz clarinet, an instrument that at one time evoked 20th-century city life in all its modernist glory. But that was two generations ago, before the war. This feels like genuinely 21st-century music: I think we'll be hearing a lot more from Rothenberg.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/mar/16/shopping.culture6","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2001/mar/16/shopping.culture6","sectionName":"Culture"},{"webTitle":"Winging it: Come fly with me","webPublicationDate":"2001-01-07T18:43:17Z","sectionId":"travel","id":"travel/2001/jan/07/observerescapesection1","fields":{"body":"<p>A few years ago, a friend asked me which single invention separated modern man from our ancestors.</p><p>'Penicillin,' I suggested. 'Photography?</p><p>Sellotape?'</p><p>'No,' he said, 'It's flight! For centuries they dreamed about it, from Icarus to Leonardo. But we can actually do it - and we should! We owe it to their memory to learn to fly!'</p><p>It's an extreme position, but then Peter is an extreme pilot - he owns three aeroplanes. And he's always looking for potential converts. A few weeks after that conversation, he took me flying.</p><p>It was a brilliant summer day in the Cotswolds, the flying club a broad acreage of cracked, grass-tufted concrete that once witnessed the rumbling of a hundred Lancaster bombers. As soon as we were airborne, Peter showed me how the pedals and joystick worked, and gave me the controls of the two-seater. We climbed away from the bosomy hills, levelling at 5,000 feet where we scampered among clouds of teased candyfloss. One was the shape of a doughnut, and I couldn't resist flying straight through the hole. It was a delirious sensation, and I began to laugh. I felt, I told him giggling, like an angel.</p><p>Peter looked at me askance. 'I've had some weird reactions taking people flying, but this is the first time anyone thought they were an angel!'</p><p>I have dreamt of flying since childhood - but who hasn't? Didn't most of us spend childhood nights flying, reliving the weightless suspension of the womb? My dreams were so vivid and familiar - they would always begin with me gliding, chest-down like Superman but mesmerically slowly, out of my room, along the landing and down the Burgundy-red stair carpet - that I was convinced of their literal reality: at night, while others slept, I flew.</p><p>I grew up in the countryside a few miles from Farnborough, and during the annual airshow I could look up from our back lawn to see the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight pass overhead. It was rare on any summer day for five minutes to go by without the sound of an aeroplane, and we would shade our eyes and wait to capture the silver flash like a fish as it passed, straight and fast, between the chimney and the woods, and we'd try to read its shape against the sky. Now, perversely, I am reassured when the summer silence of the British countryside - the hum of bees, the distant lowing of cows - is disturbed by the faint rumble of an aero engine. This, the rumble says, is how it should be.</p><p>A few years back I started work on a book about the world's deserts. Early one chilly desert morning on my two-year journey I was standing at the small aerodrome of Nazca, in Peru. The rising sun was staining the jagged Andes red. I climbed into a four-seat Cessna and the pilot, Carlos, fired up the engine.</p><p>Some things only make sense from the air. Dawn is the best moment to appreciate the Nazca lines, when the shallow ridges are shadowed by the low sun, and the air is clear and vapourless. Climbing over the pampas we soon saw them: hundreds of straight lines scoring the desert, and animal shapes, including the iconic hummingbird with its wings outstretched. They seemed smaller than I expected.</p><p>'It's because of our height,' yelled Carlos. 'They're a long way down.'</p><p>'Well, can't we go a bit lower?'</p><p>We dropped out of the dawn-pink sky to buzz the drawings. As we banked tightly they whirled around us - monkey, dog, 'owlman', spider.</p><p>No one knows why, 1,500 years ago, Nazcans engraved these lines into the desert crust. Erich von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods claimed that they were landing-strips for alien spacecraft; a more plausible theory suggests they played a role in hallucinogenic rituals. Andean museum collections groan with the paraphernalia of shamanistic drug-use, and it was - is - common for shamans in these psychedelic trances to identify with some symbolic creature. Frequently they believe their spirits take to the sky, and soar. Each of the creatures on the Nazcan crust is etched in a single line. Perhaps they were paths, walked by the shamans during their possession by the animal - spiritual, not alien, runways from which the shaman's soul took flight.</p><p>A few months after that flight, I found myself in the Peruvian Amazon, sitting in a wooden cabin with the velvet night sky overhead and the jungle raucous with insects. A shaman and I had been into the jungle and found the ayahuasca vine, and back at his village had boiled it into a thick, bilious stew. There were four of us on the oil lamp-lit porch, two of them women smoking tobacco pipes. The shaman passed the potion, and while we sipped he hummed a tune, an invocation to the spirits of ayahuasca. Soon the visions began: I was airborne, flying over endless fantastic cityscapes, their gothic towers and frothing parks delirious shades of crimson, lime-green and turquoise.</p><p>My friend Peter was surely right that as long as man has had an imagination he has dreamt of flight. Fortifications have been constructed at the highest elevations for strategic purposes, but we are also drawn to mountaintops for reasons of the soul. Hilary's conquest of Everest had for the British, in the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, some profounder meaning than a mere sporting record. Close to Everest is the fabulous Mount Meru, navel of the earth, abode of the Hindu gods. The gods of the Greeks and Romans also inhabited the heavens - as do the Trinity and angels, and all the virtuous souls, of Christianity.</p><p>The centenary of man's first powered flight occurs in two years' time. Orville and Wilbur Wright's Flyer III was a cumbersome machine, its kite-like forward rudder and complex controls in many ways an aeronautical cul-de-sac (it was Blériot's Channel-crossing monoplane that standardised the aeroplane form we know today); but the Flyer changed the world for ever, possibly for the worse. In Baden-Powell's words: 'Wilbur Wright is in possession of a power which controls the fate of nations.'</p><p>When did humans first fly? The 1965 movie Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines began with a slapstick montage of fur-clad cavemen futilely flapping their arms, and early aviators on primitive hang-gliders dropping like stones. The Chinese had constructed kites of tremendous sophistication and scale by the third century AD, and it's at least possible that people - clinging on or strapped on - took to the air. Everyone knows about the 'balloonist' craze that swept Europe in the eighteenth century in the wake of the Montgolfier brothers' hot-air ascents. But what about Sir George Cayley, MP for Scarborough, who launched a manned glider in 1848? If even a French aviation authority can call Cayley 'the true inventor of the aeroplane and one of the most powerful geniuses in the history of aviation', then it must be true - yet he languishes in obscurity.</p><p>As for me, I continued to experience livid, full-colour flying dreams into my late teens. If they stopped, perhaps it is because, as the shrinks tell us, flying dreams are associated with sexual longing. I suspect that the improvement in my sex life grounded my dreams. But I seized every opportunity that came my way to fly small aircraft.</p><p>I was in Kenya when I realised that the subject of my next book would be flight. A contact at Unesco's Nairobi desertification programme had introduced me to his son, a keen amateur pilot, who invited me to go flying with him over the Rift Valley. The problem was, neither of us had enough money to rent a plane. The following afternoon we went out to the airport, and hung around the pilot's clubroom until someone offered to take us up. It was a stunning flight, swooping around the emerald craters of the valley's extinct volcanoes. I discovered something valuable that day: that the owner of a pilot's licence can walk into an aerodrome, get chatting to fellow pilots, and stand a good chance of being offered a ride. Suddenly I had an image of myself 'hitch-hiking' by small plane from one aerodrome to the next - and the idea of Winging It was born, a journey around the planet celebrating the many facets of manned flight - a journey I'll be describing in The Observer over the next few months.</p><p>So it was that on a glittering late summer afternoon four months ago I found myself at an Ontario airfield, with six weeks in which to gain a flying licence. It was my first day at the school, and I was eager to be up in the air. Who knew how long the weather would hold? Within four hours of climbing off the Airbus, I was at the controls of a Cessna 152.</p><p>Tim Coombs, my instructor, had shown me the Walk Around: like pioneer aviators, pilots still begin every flight with a physical inspection of the plane, waggling ailerons and rudder, poking a stick in the fuel tank to check the fuel level (gauges can be unreliable), and carefully monitoring the engine's performance. To the uninitiated this behaviour implies severe doubts about the plane's airworthiness, but this is the aviator's Highway Code: when cars break down, you coast onto the hard shoulder, but aeroplanes are less forgiving, so they simply aren't allowed to go wrong. Instructors like to build your confidence fast, and they usually have you take off first time (it's landing that requires the skill). With a delicate shudder the fragile three-wheeled machine takes off, a winged Reliant Robin improbably airborne.</p><p>Within a fortnight I was learning how to enter and recover from the spins and spiral dives we've all seen in war movies, manoeuvres which place the pilot within seconds of death. I began by dreading these nauseating exercises, but ended up taking a grim pleasure in being able to pull them off (that is, pull out of them); maybe one day I'll even start to like them. Certainly, they give you confidence in your ability to handle a plane. The British have removed these perilous techniques from the flying syllabus - making us, according to one Canadian pilot, 'a bunch of woossies'. </p><p>Over the next six weeks I flew tiny trainers, a bulbous, leather-seated vintage Cessna (the 1954 equivalent of business jet) and a floatplane that scudded over the placid, pea-green lakes of northern Ontario. Cruising at 95 knots, I learned that unlike cars, planes can crash from being flown too slowly: the air passing over the wings is suddenly insufficient to generate lift, and the plane 'stalls'.</p><p>This usually occurs when a pilot is so intent on giving passengers a bird's-eye-view of, say, his new swimming pool, that he takes his eye off the speedo. A plane stalling at 3,000 feet picks up speed as it drops, quickly generates lift, and can resume flight; stall it at 500 feet, however, and before you know it your propeller is ploughing its way across a field, which in the mordant words of my instructor Tim, 'exceeds its design specification'.</p><p>I was learning to fly with half-dozen trainee commercial pilots, and conversation often revolved around aviation's unspoken freemasonic secret: the fact that it's dangerous. (Q: 'What's the definition of a good landing? A: One that you can walk away from.') Pilots naturally tend to a gallows humour: they know theirs is a job where failure can wipe the smiles off 300 holidaymakers. I've never forgotten the visual gag in Airplane, where the in-flight movie contentedly watched by passive, post-prandial passengers is a montage of aircraft crashes and great balls of fire. When I first saw the film the audience's laughter was edged with hysteria - this was a taboo flamboyantly transgressed, a joke that stirred our most assiduously buried fears.</p><p>The airliner is an aseptic high technology, close for most of us to brain surgery and rocket science. We all made paper aeroplanes at school, but the spectacle of a 365-ton jumbo jet ponderously mounting the air fills us with a superstitious sense of nature violated.</p><p>Consider the morbid press ecstasies whenever one of the slender aluminium tubes plunges into ocean, mountain or municipal housing unit. We are happy to drive along a wet motorway at 90 with spouse and new-born sleeping beside us - that's acceptable risk (it's a statistical fact that planes are safer than family cars); but when Concorde, with its hitherto 100 per cent safety record, experiences a freak accident, we are irrationally disturbed.</p><p>In flight, we behave as though we're not. The cabin staff's professional grins, the videos and Muzak all conspire to distract us from the terrifying miracle of flight. Magic seeks to appease the Gods, and flight is unquestionably magic; passengers know they have propitiated no one, signed no Faustian pact - they are exposed. Just two trembling wings and a clutch of fallible engines keep them airborne. And what about Human Error? The technology depends on two gold-braided fly-boys (they're usually male) up front, and recent events (the Russian pilot who let his knee-dandled son plough a plane into the ground, those heavy-drinking BA pilots) have taught us they're not angels. Taxiing up to take-off one morning, my plane skewed to the left. I shut the engine down and went to look for Paul, the mechanic. I found him with his head inside a deconstructed Cessna.</p><p>'Paul, I have a Situation.'</p><p>'Whassat?'</p><p>'Left brake locked on taxi.'</p><p>He pulled himself out of the fuselage, wiped his hands on his overalls and picked up a hammer.</p><p>'Is that what you need?' I asked.</p><p>'It fixes most things.'</p><p>He beat the brake pads and, achieving no result, grunted and stuck his head under the dashboard. I went to find a coat against the Canadian autumn winds. When I returned, Paul was smiling. 'You're lucky it didn't lock a couple of minutes later, when you were landing. Woulda spun you right off the runway.'</p><p>'Oh. Is it safe now?'</p><p>'Safe is a relative term, my friend. I keep both my feet on the ground.'</p><p>In the mid-1960s, my father took a job with the UN, and we as a family were en route to Turkey via Rome. The era of flight as mass transit had arrived with the plane we were flying - a Boeing 707 - but flight was still romantic then, and Pan American had yet to become a victim of deregulated airways and go bust. Our Boeing was curvaceous, and the miniskirted hostesses who wore crisp, virtually seamless dresses like those in Kubrick's 2001 gave us children crayons and colouring books. The outline drawings all showed airliners and airports, and trilbied, suited emissaries of capitalism grinning as they passed through sleek and streamlined terminals, utopian symbols of Modernity. What happened to it all? When did the giddy romance of flight implode into the banality of mass tourism, where every grey terminal resembles every other, with the numbing inevitabilities of the X-ray machine and the stuttering Baggage Claim carousel?</p><p>Yet there are still thousands of courageous, wary figures who wrestle small planes over deserts and choppy seas and fog-covered mountains - planes that have changed little technically in 50 years. There are pilots who live in hangars, sleeping beside their planes, and others who have devoted their lives and chequebooks to the preservation of ancient, impossibly exotic aircraft. Then there are the half-mad aerobatics junkies, the air racers, the exhibition pilots who risk everything to thrill a jaded crowd, and meet their deaths at airshows with sickening regularity. It was to encounter these pilots, all over the world, that I decided to set off on the journey I'll be describing in The Observer.</p><p> My most memorable flight as a pilot so far came after six weeks in the Canadian skies, soon after I gained my licence. It stirred me (it still does) to wake up and see the leather wallet with Pilot Licence printed on it in gold sitting on the bedside table. That day I woke up early to a bright, cloudless winter sky. Perfect. At the aerodrome I tugged my plane round into the sun's first copper rays, and as they melted the fine layer of iced dew on the wings I completed the flyer's ritual, checking ailerons and rudder and poking a length of dowling into the fuel tanks to be sure that the cockpit gauges didn't lie.</p><p>Climb in, headphones on, fire her up, taxi onto the runway. Add full power, and the engine is almost brutally alive, the prop jerking the fuselage forward as you accelerate to 10,000 rpm. At around 55 knots you ease back the stick, and there it is - weightlessness, gravity-defiance, the instant miracle of flight, the landscape falling away from you, emerald streaked with early-morning gold.</p><p><strong>Winging it</strong></p><p>Martin Buckley sets off this week on his global journey by small aircraft.

Local authorities have been some of the biggest recipients. </p><p>The award of  £473,000 to Action for Blind People (AFBP) in greater London, a charity that attempts to provide blind people with the skills they need to find employment, is thought to be the first case of a disability charity winning a substantial SRB grant. It will allow AFBP to develop a network of partners over the next three years to boost training in Information and Computer Technologies (ICT). </p><p>The scheme will build on the rapid development of powerful voice recognition software. There will be an emphasis on educating trainers to ensure the benefits are long lasting.</p><p>AFBP already runs a training centre in south London. But the grant will promote outreach to partner organisations around the capital, thus reducing access and mobility problems.</p><p>The windfall came almost by chance. \"Details of SRB sixth round funding found their way into the office,\" said Gill Astarita, AFBP's development director. \"We realised we could actually use this to start something innovative around overcoming access difficulties.\"</p><p>With just weeks to the June deadline for the bid's submission, a working group frantically got to grips with the SRB criteria, framing how their proposal would tackle economic disadvantage and social exclusion. But AFBP is grateful to officials at the government office of the London region who offered some clues about how a bid should set out. \"They showed us where the goal posts were,\" said Ms Astarita.</p><p>Development should start in the spring, and plans to recruit three new trainers and a job search coordinator are well under way. Mike Webster, employment and training manager for London, is making appeals for new partners. The group is aiming for around 25 - about five in each of London's five learning and skills council areas. </p><p>Partners will supply premises and administrative support, while AFBP will deliver training and the ICT equipment. The aim is for around 500 people to access training over the three years and for at least 50 jobs to be created. Others may become self-employed. Even where training is not followed with employment, computer training will still tackle social exclusion - a key aim of the SRB funding. </p><p>AFBP runs training centres in three other locations in England and would like to expand. </p><p>Roughly three-quarters of blind and partially sighted people are unemployed. African and African-Caribbean groups in particular face a double disadvantage because of their ethnic minority status. There is also a greater danger of visual impairment through higher incidence of diabetes and sickle cell anaemia in these groups.</p><p>Ibukun Olashore, director of one the new partner groups, the Southwark-based Organisation of Blind African Caribbeans (OBAC), welcomed the opportunity to \"train trainers\". While there were plenty of knowledgeable IT workers, she said, many were not familiar with access issues for blind and visually impaired people. The partnership represented the chance to take ICT training to a much higher level than OBAC had been able to provide up to now. \"The technology is moving so fast and it is very easy to be out of date,\" she added.</p><p>Ms Olashore also highlights the lack of motivation and confidence experienced by those who have lost their sight. Jagdish Tank, now in his 40s, came to live in Britain after sight loss four years ago, ending his involvement with the family firm in Kenya. He has been learning braille and typing with the Haringey Phoenix Group, which offers support and training to the blind and visually impaired.</p><p>\"Losing my sight was a huge trauma,\" he said. \"It took me quite a while before I could come back to life. I thought I would never get on my feet. I hope that with good IT skills I will be able to get into business or employment.\"</p><p>Tom Stapleton, the group's manager, said he was \"very excited\" at the prospect of the partnership with AFBP. \"We have a number of young people of working age who are anxious to get back into employment,\" he said. \"They are not trained and have no skills - this is where the scheme is going to make a difference.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/dec/27/charities.disability","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2000/dec/27/charities.disability","sectionName":"Society"},{"webTitle":"Rubber firm bounces into ISPs","webPublicationDate":"2000-12-14T08:50:19Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2000/dec/14/newmedia.business","fields":{"body":"<p>David Montgomery's reinvention as an internet entrepreneur moved closer yesterday when his new employer struck a deal that places it in position to become the dominant internet service provider in Africa. </p><p>African Lakes, a former colonial trading company founded in the late 19th century by some associates of the explorer David Livingstone, said it would set up a joint venture company with a South African technology firm to develop internet services across 14 countries in Africa.  </p><p>Mr Montgomery, the group's recently appointed executive chairman and former Mirror boss, said that the link with Uunet SA, a subsidiary of telecoms group WorldCom, was consistent with African Lakes' strategy of moving away from its traditional business of rubber plantations and transportation towards a new focus on communications.  </p><p>The deal will combine the corporate subscriber base and brand of African Lakes' Africa Online internet service provider subsidiary with Uunet's infrastructure.

It is light and airy, warm and comforting. It is my castle in the air, far removed from the two-\tbedroom basement flat we can afford. </p><p>Searching for a property is never easy, especially when ideals do not compare with reality. In London, space is the ultimate luxury and a snatch of greenery is the diamond carrot for financially stretched buyers. In this environment, bargains are snapped up before house details are even printed so it pays to either befriend an estate agent or look online.  </p><p>Warned by Stephen Fry about estate agents - who \"with their jangling keys, nasty suits, revolting beards, moustaches and tinted spectacles, roam the land causing perturbation and despair\" - I turned to my computer.  </p><p>Property sites are a booming, gazumping business online. As the new property databases with their virtual tours and vast range of properties propagate, so too have the estate agents produced hi-tech sites of their own to entice their customers back.  </p><p>An even greater risk to the estate agents are the dot.com property companies who often charge zero commission and are beginning to get a foothold in the industry. Progress may be slow but Rome wasn't built in a day and a   house is rarely found in a week.  </p><p>I began my own search at <a href=\"http://www.findaproperty.com\">www.findaproperty.com</a> which is a database of properties from several estate agents, both large and small. Simple to use (just key in ideal prices, number of bedrooms and postcodes), it comes up with a list of properties matching your description. If you find something you like, you can email your interest directly to the estate agent involved. For all the wonders of modern technology, only one in six responded so it is often best to contact them by phone.  </p><p>The site also gave excellent local information, council tax prices, comments from residents and virtual tours. These tours allow you to see into the home using panoramic imagery which can really test estate agent speak (\"funky\" meaning \"ghastly paintwork\" and \"light and airy\" meaning \"one window in the basement\").  </p><p>Other good sites are <a href=\"http://www.assertahome.com\">www.assertahome.com</a> - it has a change of address service and online applications for new utilities - and <a href=\"http://www.08004homes.com\">www.08004homes.com</a> (with online interior design magazine). <a href=\"http://www.propertylive.co.uk\">www.propertylive.co.uk</a> also provides information on buying and selling a home.   </p><p>According to Tim, one of that rare breed of nice estate agents, properties are updated every week on the internet so the chances of finding a home still for sale are much higher there than from the colour brochures that come through your letterbox - these are often a month out of date.  </p><p>Vendors and buyers can avoid agents altogether with sites such as <a href=\"http://www.loot.co.uk\">www.loot.co.uk</a>,, <a href=\"http://www.linkupproperties.co.uk\">www.linkupproperties.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.easier.co.uk\">www.easier.co.uk</a>. These charge vendors a small sum to advertise but are free to buyers. You can search for a property then email your interest and details to the seller who will then contact you direct. Some sites allow you to contact the sellers direct.  </p><p>Some even price their properties a little more competitively since they will be saving on estate agency fees. These are a useful resource if you are not in a rush to buy. Most sites require registration.  </p><p>At <a href=\"http://www.auctions.co.uk/\">www.auctions.co.uk</a> property/ there is a list of forthcoming property auctions. You can request brochures online and subsequently view a property in your desired area and price range. It is important to have cash up front and know your prices. We met a lot of professional \"auction buyers\" who intimidated us with their shiny grey suits and patronising manner. I am still seeking a website that teaches you how to deal with such individuals.  </p><p>My castle in the air proved to be a subterranean flat. Dark in places with the odd whiff of mildew, but it felt like home. After a thrilling sealed bid where the advice of sites such as <a href=\"http://www.findaproperty.com\">www.findaproperty.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.propertylive.co.uk\">www.propertylive.co.uk</a> was useful in understanding procedures and competitive prices, we started the next stage: looking for a mortgage.  </p><p>Mortgage advisers are another strange breed with their peculiar passion for all things numerical. The potential embarrassment of    exposing my knowledge of figures had me reaching for my mouse and looking online. I went straight to my home page and linked through to <a href=\"http://www.charcoalonline.com\">www.charcoalonline.com</a> where a mortgage wizard takes you through a series of relevant questions to help find your ideal mortgage before calculating the cost.  </p><p>The site does offer special deals but it is useful to have some kind of prior knowledge to get what you want. I did my background research at <a href=\"http://www.mortgages-online.co.uk\">www.mortgages-online.co.uk</a> , which offers an excellent guide to most kinds of mortgages. We eventually found what we wanted at <a href=\"http://www.woolwich.co.uk\">www.woolwich.co.uk</a> which not only offers good (if biased) mortgage advice but also information and details about the very latest open plan, offset mortgages.  </p><p>With both property and mortgage secured, it was back to my castle in the air and to the ultimate property website, <a href=\"http://www.property.org.uk\">www.property.org.uk</a>. This is a daydreamer's paradise. Here you can buy a safari park in Kenya, a castle in Perth, floating homes in London and an island in Loch Lomond for only &#163;15,000.  </p><p>So, as I dream about turrets and ravaged coastlines; galloping through the savannah back to my homestead; watching the sun come down on the deck of my 60ft narrow boat, property prices continue to rise and estate agents continue to irritate. Or in the tempered words of Stephen Fry: \"There's only one thing worse than an estate agent but at least that can be safely lanced, drained and surgically dressed.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/oct/12/internetnews.onlinesupplement","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/oct/12/internetnews.onlinesupplement","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Global battle rages over GM crops as biotech revolution ploughs on","webPublicationDate":"2000-07-24T01:05:34Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"science/2000/jul/24/gm.food","fields":{"body":"<p>When Professor Howard Atkinson and colleagues at Leeds University genetically modified a potato to be pest-resistant without the use of chemicals, it was decided to test it in Bolivia, one of the world's poorest and most malnourished countries and the place where the potato originated. The Bolivian government gave permission, and if the trial proves successful Prof Atkinson will not benefit financially. </p><p>The grassroots reaction surprised Prof Atkinson. Instead of the experiment, part-funded by the Department for International Development, being welcomed as an attempt to counter a dietary problem, activists went to the village near the proposed trial site and, he said, \"provided them &#91;the locals&#93; with misinformation\".  </p><p>The trial has now been delayed for more than a year. The local groups feared that any genetic contamination could never be put right and argued that Bolivia should not risk its most important resource, its biodiversity.  </p><p>Hundreds of such skirmishes are being fought around the world. While activists try to destroy the credibility of GM crop trials in Britain by trashing sites, scientists, lawyers, politicians, consumer and environment groups, corporations, ethicists, the popular press, international bureaucrats, academics, farmers, food companies, consumers and traders are involved in a global battle over a technology which has been on the market only five years.  </p><p>Twelve countries are growing GM crops commercially, four more than last year. More than 100m acres are grown worldwide. In the US, where 72% of the crops are grown, more than 30 crops and hundreds of varieties are now sold.  </p><p>Across the world, thousands of varieties are being tested. Within a few years most of the world could be awash with GM food. In Europe it is another story. Applications to start commercial growing of the crops are caught in the paralysed regulatory system, where there has been a moratorium - which the European commission is now to scrap, to the fury of anti-GM groups.  </p><p>The industry has invested heavily in the technology and is only beginning to see the returns. The global market is worth about $3bn (&#163;2bn) and should be worth $25bn by 2010. But the shift in public perception has also cost hundreds of millions of dollars in lost markets.  </p><p>The stakes are equally high for the activists, who see GM food as a social, ethical and ecological cause. Their greatest success is still in Europe, where powerful pressure groups say demand for the food has all but dried up, consumer resistance is as strong as ever, farmers are confused and wary of testing the crops, and big food companies are getting the message. As in Britain, many supermarket chains and food processors are committed to   GM-free food, at least in their own brands.  </p><p>Scientists developing the second generation of GM crops hope that by building in health benefits such as added vitamins or low fat oils they will persuade consumers. Much hinges on what happens in the US. Sweetcorn and sugar beet growers scaled down GM plantings, but soya and cotton are reported to be well up. Polls indicate that support for the crops among US consumers and food and drink companies has slipped.  </p><p>Seven major GM companies, fearing that the home market could implode, as in Europe, are spending $50m to \"build public support for GM\". Their campaign seeks to distance these foods from environmental or safety issues and link them to the benefits of GM developments in medicine.    </p><p><strong> Marketing challenge</strong><br /> </p><p> \"In the past,\" said David Rowe of DowAgro Sciences, a subsidiary of the GM company Dow Chemicals, \"agribusiness has spent only trivial amounts on marketing, compared with the billions spent on developing the technology. The greatest challenge is not in the technology, but the marketing.\"  </p><p>In Japan, the leading importer of GM products, a petition of more than 23m names asking US farmers not to plant GM crops chivvied the government into introducing strict labelling.  </p><p>US embassies and trade missions promote the technology. International scientific bodies, world agriculture bodies and the UN system are moving strongly behind its potential, with caveats about safety and regulation. The World Bank is looking at ways it could assist the development of agricultural genetic engineering in the third world.  </p><p>\"The bank has provided hundreds of millions of dollars to develop agriculture, including biotech, in countries such as Kenya, Zimbabwe, Indonesia, and Mexico, and has asserted that feeding the world is 'inconceivable' without genetic engineering,\" said Luke Harding, a British activist and author.  </p><p>Biotech is also becoming an \"aid\" component. Western governments, together with multilateral donors such as the EU, are beginning to allocate public money to its development in poor countries.  </p><p>\"Intellectually the debate is becoming polarised, with positions hardening,\" said a South American analyst. \"You have powerful northern groups linking with southern organisations pumping out their propaganda, and a frenzied defence of the technology from governments, corporations and scientists. It is becoming a global faultline.\"  </p><p>Opponents argue that the revolution is happening too fast to assess its effects properly and that the strict science and safety approach adopted by proponents is too narrow. In rich countries most debate has been about food safety and pollution; in developing countries the concerns are often about socio-economic issues, such as who owns the technology, the potential dependency of farmers and debt.    </p><p><strong> Uncertainty</strong><br /> </p><p>Many countries fear going down the route of full-scale GM planting while there is so much uncertainty. Thailand turned down the opportunity to grow GM rice for fear it would be unable to export it. Greece and Brazil say the way forward may be to designate entire regions as GM-free. Tasmania is proposing to use its quarantine laws to ban the foods.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the trend for the large GM companies to buy up conventional seed companies in developing countries is continuing. The industry is accused of taking advantage of places where there is little or no regulatory control. The companies say they work within existing laws and in some cases help draft biosafety legislation.  </p><p>In Colombia protesters say that GM trials of cotton, rice, potatoes and tomatoes are taking place without full biosafety laws, and that people have been eating, without their knowledge, imported GM foods.  </p><p>Olga Berlova, of the Socio-Ecological Union in Moscow, said: \"In Russia we know from UN organisations that GM soybeans are growing, yet even Russian officials are unable to get information from companies. The corporations are paying Russian institutes directly to do the trials and bypassing the regulatory system.\"  </p><p>In China, where GM cotton and tobacco are grown, a new law will require labelling of GM seeds, the country's first restriction of the crops. Brazil broadly opposes GM crops, mainly for pragmatic reasons, having benefited from selling conventional soya to Europe. The state of Rio Grande do Sul has declared itself GM-free, but the policy is not popular with all farmers, especially those short of feed grain for their livestock after drought.  </p><p>The GM company Monsanto has faced long delays in introducing its crops in many countries after opposition in the courts and communities. It has now been allowed to undertake large-scale field trials of its cotton in India, but is caught up in a legal battle in Brazil.  </p><p>Tony Coombes, director of corporate affairs for Monsanto UK, said the growing proportion of neutral and positive news about GM developments bore out what had been happening in the world recently. Acreage was \"flat to up\", compared with last year, which itself saw a 44% increase on 1998. \"With Brazilian ministers listening hard to farmers' demands, China racing to make sure it can feed its population, academics in developing countries asking to be free to make their own minds up, global GM now seems to be taking two steps forward for every one step back.  </p><p>\"Confusion in the debate seems to originate from failure to distinguish what is fact, hypothesis, speculation, opinion and fear of the unknown. There now seems global acceptance that the science isn't perfect, but it is better than the alternative, which is guesswork and stargazing.\"  </p><p>Opponents do not see it that way. Greenpeace France said this week: \"We are in the middle of a huge fight. It is difficult to predict what will happen.\"  </p><p>Out of the chaos, international rules are emerging. This year the first treaty regulating the trade in GM products was signed. The biosafety protocol should, if ratified, allow nations to bar imports of the crops and other GM organisms based on social, environmental, health and social risks. But it could take years to translate into national laws.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/jul/24/gm.food","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/science/2000/jul/24/gm.food","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"A catalogue for global gardeners","webPublicationDate":"2000-04-20T00:06:38Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2000/apr/20/onlinesupplement11","fields":{"body":"<p><strong> Global Biodiversity: Earth's Living Resources in the 21st Century </strong> (World Conservation Monitoring Centre &#163;29.99)  </p><p> One species, Mark Collins points out in the foreword, has appropriated 40% of the world's productivity; about a dozen crops provide 75% of its food.
