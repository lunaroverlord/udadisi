The 2009 Transparency International index in full","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-17T13:42:32Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2009/nov/17/corruption-index-transparency-international","fields":{"body":"<p>How endemic is corruption around the world - and where does it flourish?</p><p><a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009\">Transparency International's 2009 Corruption Perceptions Index</a> (CPI) is the world's most credible measure of of domestic, public sector corruption. </p><p>Figures released today show that public corruption in Afghanistan has worsened over the past two years and is now more rampant than in any country apart from Somalia. Afghanistan has sunk for the second straight year in this ranking of 180 nations based on perceived levels of corruption in the public sector.</p><p>The CPI scores countries on a scale of zero to 10, with zero indicating high levels of corruption and 10, low levels. That ranking is based on data from country experts and business leaders at 10 independent institutions, including the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/\">World Bank</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eiu.com/index.asp?rf=0\">Economist Intelligence Unit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/en/index.htm\">World Economic Forum</a>. </p><p>Countries which saw their ranking drop included Iran, which fell to 1.8 from 2.3 following the presidential election in June. Political turmoil also contributed to a fall in Ukraine's score to 2.2 from 2.5. Greece saw its score slide to 3.8 from 4.7, reflecting insufficient 'anti-corruption enforcement', lengthy delays in the judicial process and a string of corporate scandals that TI said pointed to \"systemic weaknesses\".</p><p>Fragile, unstable states that are scarred by war and ongoing conflict linger at the bottom of the index. Meanwhile, the highest scorers in the 2009 CPI are New Zealand, Denmark, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. </p><p>But the vast majority of countries in the 2009 index scored below five.</p><p>The full data is below and we've added in last year's rankings too.

impoverished, rural areas. With water scarcity predicted to increase, now is the time to prioritise rural water supply, particularly in dryland regions that are on the frontline of climate change. Here an investment of $1bn dollars would give 100 million people a clean, local, sustainable water supply for life.</p><p>How is this possible? In two words: sand dams.</p><p>Over the past decade, Kenyan farmers with support from development organisations such as my own, have constructed hundreds of sand dams. Sand dams are reinforced concrete walls built across seasonal sandy rivers. During the intense rainy seasons, the dam fills with rainwater and sediment: silt flows over the dam whilst the heavier sand sinks. As the riverbed fills with sand, around 25-40% of the water by volume is stored in the voids. The sand filters the water and reduces contamination and evaporation. The dams also transform the local ecology. They raise the water-table, recharge the aquifer and increase downstream, dry-season flows.</p><p>Examples of sand dams are found throughout the dryland regions of the world but their wider adoption is limited by a lack of awareness, appropriate support and funding.</p><p>Sand dams are the cheapest form of rainwater harvesting -a typical dam costs less than £8,000 to build, requires negligible maintenance and provides water for life for around 1,200 people. They are cost-effective, community owned and sustainable. They transform lives and they transform fragile environments.

In many parts of the world, industrial expansion is restricted due to problems with access to freshwater. Despite the extent of the challenge, research states that there is enough water to meet the needs of the global population and those of planet, while supporting economic growth.</p><p>But, if there is enough water, how is it that we are experiencing such shortage? The answer is that this most precious of resources is appallingly neglected and managed. Shockingly, in many major rivers, we lack the basic information and monitoring which tells us how much water is available, and when.</p><p>We must invest in the organisations and institutions that manage the world's water to implement better management systems and increase awareness of the issue at hand, so that we cease to squander and waste this vital resource.</p><p>This is a global issue and we need a global response. Using the resources of this prize we should establish a global water partnership fund to which other sectors would contribute: energy and resource companies, development agencies, and global food producers. The fund could then provide the resources, manpower and equipment so badly needed across the world for water security.</p><h2>Public awareness<br />'Potentially the greatest challenges are social and political'<br /><a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/h.wheater\" title=\"Professor Howard Wheater\">Professor Howard Wheater</a> of Imperial College</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-355667500'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/05/14/water84.jpg' alt='A man throws a net into water beside a wharf damaged by cylone Nargis in Burma' width='140' height='84' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The world faces a growing water crisis, exacerbated by population growth, climate change and the pollution of existing resources. The problems are multi-dimensional. Water scarcity has already led to local conflict, three quarters of the world's water use is for irrigated agriculture, hence water, land and food are inextricably linked. And water supply and sanitation is energy intensive, so energy and water are also inextricably linked.</p><p>There is no magic bullet. We must curb population growth and greenhouse gas emissions to limit future damage, but adaptation of water use is needed. This requires social awareness, technological development and potentially new political and legal structures to support integrated policy at national and international levels.</p><p>Technical solutions include:</p><p>• Managing water demand through public awareness, water efficiency and smarter urban water systems</p><p>• New technology to increase the available resource, e.g. rainwater harvesting, active management of groundwater recharge and storage</p><p>• Improved short and long term forecasting of floods and droughts</p><p>• Improved energy and resource efficiency in water and wastewater treatment, including energy recovery from wastes</p><p>• Appropriate technology for rural water supply, e.g. solar-based desalination</p><p>• Development of drought resistant crops and improved irrigation efficiency.</p><p>Potentially the greatest challenges are social and political. Public awareness is central to adaptation to a future where we will need to live with water scarcity and to address the political and legal problems which underlie many aspects of the unsustainable use of water.</p><h2>Kill subsidies<br />'There would be a real incentive to reduce wastefulness with water'<br />Robert Pendray, student at Merton College, Oxford</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-355667501'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2007/09/12/EuroCoins84.jpg' alt='Euro money coins' width='140' height='84' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In most countries, water prices are heavily subsidised by governments. This means the price the consumer pays is not reflective of the actual cost needed to extract, clean and distribute the water. My idea is to remove this subsidy and allow privately operated water companies to charge an appropriate amount for water. This would free up a lot of money which I propose be redistributed via what I call \"water allowances\".</p><p>These water allowances would be an amount of money which people can use to purchase water. The amount would be set by the government and would aim to provide people with enough water for basic needs. If people want additional water, for whatever reason, they are free to purchase it with their own money but the price will obviously be many times higher than it is at present.</p><p>It is important to consider agriculture and business as they use the majority of water. They also currently receive subsidised water, although not always to the same degree as domestic use. With my idea, they would receive allowances based on what they are producing and how much. The government would judge how much water is needed in their operations, assuming they are working with water very efficiently. They would then receive a water allowance based upon that. This means organisations which are currently using water efficiently may see reduced costs, and those which are not may see increased costs.</p><p>There are two main reasons why this would work. Firstly, water companies would now be privately run which means they would likely operate a lot more efficiently and productively than at present. Secondly, and more importantly, there would be a real incentive to reduce wastefulness with water, as there would now be a significant financial cost for businesses and homeowners if they didn't.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/17/earthwatch-institute-drought","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/17/earthwatch-institute-drought","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Tea farmers struggle for survival in fields of gold","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-08T00:07:18Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2009/nov/08/food-commodity-prices-land-grab","fields":{"body":"<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-355048494\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_47533393001_fairtrade-tea-01-16x9.flv\"></source>\n      </video><p><br />The villagers of Thatarber Manihatty in south India knew they had no choice but to mortgage their small plots of farmland when they found they could not afford to bury dead relatives or send children to school without the generosity of neighbours.</p><p>Six thousand feet up in the breathtaking Nilgiri hills of Tamil Nadu, hope was thin on the ground until Sumani Subramani, a 30-year-old former office clerk, drew a line in the brick-red soil.</p><p>Quitting her desk job, Subramani organised the farmers into a co-operative. Banding together, they first negotiated better prices from local tea processing factories. Then, pooling meagre profits from plucking leaves on the steep hills, the new co-op collected 20,000 rupees (£260) a month and, plot by plot, began to reclaim land from the banks.</p><p>\"For 10 years we suffered because of low prices, and money makers took our land and we have to pay interest to them,\" Subramani explains. \"So women got together to form a group and we saved money to start this business.\"</p><p>Shoppers in Britain, who, after Iraq, consume more tea per head than anywhere else in the world, may have barely noticed that the price of a cuppa in supermarkets has increased by 15%. Severe droughts in Kenya – the world's biggest producer of tea for tea bags – and the central Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, together with political instability disrupting production in Sri Lanka, have hit supply and sparked a 50% price surge on world markets.</p><p>For the 800 inhabitants of Thatarber Manihatty, misfortune elsewhere has proved advantageous. Higher tea prices and generous state support have enabled 20 smallholders out of 56 to reclaim their land. But nothing comes easy for the people here. Rain has fallen in Kenya in recent weeks and, with that, tea prices have dropped. It is uncertain whether the village will earn enough for the remaining 36 smallholders to buy back their land.</p><p>\"Whenever there's a shortage we prosper,\" says Narayanaswamy Sriram, a prominent tea broker in Tamil Nadu. \"If everything is fine, we're doomed.\"</p><p>To RD Naseem, the energetic executive director of the Tamil Nadu Tea Board, based in the bustling tea town of Coonoor, the postwar history of commodity prices is a troubling, relentless decline (see graphs, above), creating a huge challenge. \"Have you ever wondered which is the cheapest beverage in the world? Even in India?\" he asks. \"Tea is cheaper than bottled water. Please go back and ask your grandmothers how much they paid for a kilo of tea, and you'll be surprised that today you are paying less than what your grans were paying 50 years back.\"</p><p>Sentiments such as these are no doubt shared by the majority of the world's smallholders. Tea, coffee, cocoa, cotton and rice prices have all fallen in real terms over the past four decades, plunging 500&nbsp;million smallholder families deeper into poverty while helping the developed world get richer.</p><p>But could this be about to change? Last week, Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, said America and Europe should prepare for huge rises in oil and food prices: \"Developed markets will pay more for copper, soya beans and oil. Primarily, America will have to make significant adjustments in the way it consumes natural resources.\"</p><p>He added: \"Emerging markets will crowd out developed-market demand. We saw a hint of it last year. Once we have a recovery in economic activity, these problems will resume. Even without recovery we will have a problem.\"</p><p>A growing world population, increased prosperity in emerging economies, a transfer of agricultural land to biofuel crops, and a dramatic rise in land-grabs by China, South Korea and Saudi Arabia have combined with speculative investing to fuel startling gyrations in commodity prices on world markets.</p><p>First, there was the spike that saw oil rise to $147 a barrel 15 months ago, pulling agricultural commodities in its slipstream. While the bank crisis saw a rapid puncturing of bubbles as banks deleveraged, analysts confirm that in the past six months, up to half of the new liquidity given to banks by governments has gone into commodities, sparking a fresh boom.</p><p>Andrew Jarvis, a former policy adviser in the Cabinet Office and now a senior research fellow at Chatham House, says: \"There are a lot of stories on food markets that are all simultaneously true.\"</p><p>On the face of it, this should play into the hands of food producers in the developing world. But higher inputs – the cost of fertilisers, seeds and machinery – have hurt them badly. The result is that the number of people starving has risen from 830 million to one billion in just over one year, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation.</p><p>That is why, after decades of investing in infrastructure and industrial projects in poor nations, the World Bank last year announced a 50% increase in money going to farming, to $6bn.</p><p>\"The World Bank was insufficiently engaged in harnessing the power of agriculture and development and we are now gradually moving to engagement,\" says Mark Cackler, manager of the agriculture and rural development department at the World Bank. \"Seventy-five per cent of the poor are mostly engaged in farming. To achieve a reduction in poverty we have to work with [them].\"</p><p>That may be, but smallholders are having to cope with a new threat: land-grabs. Concern in China, South Korea and Gulf states over how they will feed their growing populations amid pressure on water resources and the effects of climate change has prompted a new rush for land in Africa, eastern Europe and parts of Asia. The International Food Policy Research Institute has reported that 8.66m hectares – an area about the same size as Italy's arable land – has been snapped up in Africa by emerging economies. But the real figure could be much higher.</p><p>Commodity experts such as Goldman Sachs's Currie believe that land-grabbing is a good thing. He argues it will lead to more investment in agriculture. But others worry that the phenomenon will see farmers thrown off their land as more powerful forces move in.</p><p>The billionaire speculator George Soros highlighted the land-buying frenzy earlier this year. \"I'm convinced farm land is going to be one of the best investments of our time,\" he said. \"Eventually, of course, food prices will get high enough that the market probably will be flooded with supply through development of new land or technology or both, and the bull market will end. But that's a long way away yet.\"</p><p>Especially if recent UN projections are to be believed. They suggest that if the world's population reaches 9.1 billion by 2050, it will require a 70% increase in food production from 2007 levels, including a 900m tonne (43%) increase in cereal production and a 200m tonne (74%) increase in meat production.</p><p>G8 world leaders, at their summit in  Italy in July, promised $20bn (£12bn) to combat the growing food crisis in the developing world. But senior observers have suggested this will amount to just $3bn of new money.</p><p>In two weeks, the UN will hold its second emergency food summit in Rome. Leaders of 30 countries and the Pope are slated to attend. For Sumani Subramani, the villagers of Thatarber Manihatty and the two billion people who rely on smallholder farming to eat, the world's leaders need to furnish them with the wherewithal to survive.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2008/07/30/plantation140.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/08/food-commodity-prices-land-grab","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/nov/08/food-commodity-prices-land-grab","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Lifting the lid on climate change talks","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-07T00:10:12Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2009/nov/07/climate-change-talks-2009","fields":{"body":"<p>At 8am on Wednesday 7 October, a smartly dressed fiftysomething Filipino woman took the escalator to the first floor of the UN building in Bangkok and merged into a throng of diplomats, civil servants and environmentalists arriving for the eighth day of the ninth session of the global climate talks. She was met with a few respectful nods.</p><p>Bernarditas de Castro Muller – \"Ditas\" to her chums – chatted to a journalist and a colleague, and then went to work in conference room 1.

Photograph: Gian Paul Lozza</figcaption></figure><p>Bernarditas is officially an environment adviser to the Filipino government, and lead negotiator and co-ordinator of the 130 developing countries in the umbrella group known as the G77 plus China. She negotiates in what is called \"the ad hoc working group on long-term co-operative action (AWG-LCA) process under the Bali action plan\". In short, she represents the interests of nearly two-thirds of the poorest people of the world in the climate talks.</p><p>It's her job – along with a few other G77 negotiators – to keep together the traditionally squabbling poor nations at least until the major power blocks like the US and EU inevitably split and outmanoeuvre them. She must wrest the best possible financial deal for them by insisting that the rich countries commit to deep CO2 cuts. She is a pivotal figure in the talks, a lightning rod for western distrust and for southern hopes.</p><p>But this sweaty Bangkok morning has started badly. Manila, the capital of the Philippines, 1,000 miles east, is literally <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/28/philippines-storm-death-toll\" title=\"under water\">under water</a> following back-to-back typhoons and floods, and in the last few days there have also been a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/30/tsunami-earthquake-american-samoa-dead\" title=\"tsunami in Samoa\">tsunami in Samoa</a> and an earthquake claiming over 1,000 lives in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/01/second-earthquake-sumatra-indonesia\" title=\"Sumatra\">Sumatra</a>. Moreover, the climate talks on which UN secretary general <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/bankimoon\" title=\"Ban Ki-moon\">Ban Ki-moon</a> has said \"the future of this entire humanity\" depends are deadlocked.</p><p>Environmentalists say the series of disasters should concentrate minds, but with just six full negotiating days before world leaders join the final conference of the parties in Copenhagen, the diplomats of 181 countries present in Bangkok have failed to agree on the big issues: what carbon cuts rich countries should make, how much money the poor should get to help them adapt to climate change, and where that money should come from. A draft text has been hacked down by negotiators from 250-odd pages to half that, leaving the UN bureaucracy optimistic – but everyone knows it has been painfully slow.</p><p>In these talks nobody moves until everybody moves, so most of the big issues will now only be resolved by politicians in late-night horse-trading sessions at very end of next month's talks in Copenhagen. But right now in Bangkok another matter is brewing that threatens to derail the negotiations and which illustrates the immense gulf that exists between rich and poor countries.</p><p>The UN's <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php\" title=\"Kyoto protocol\">Kyoto protocol</a>, which has been signed by 184 countries and commits all the word's rich nations except the US to cut emissions, is the base of the present talks, but it has just come under massive attack. The US negotiating team, led by the bearded former climate thinktank scientist <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/03/120777.htm\" title=\"Jonathan Pershing\">Jonathan Pershing</a>, is playing traditional hardball diplomacy, stating categorically that it will not join Kyoto. There's nothing new in US intransigence on climate change, but in a dramatic development, Europe and Australia have just sided for the first time publicly with the US, arguing that the Kyoto treaty should now be ditched in favour of a new one to get the Americans on board.</p><p>The poor, represented mostly by the G77 and China, are outraged. Why should the whole world change, they ask, just to accommodate the US? This Bangkok meeting should have been spent negotiating how far rich countries were prepared to cut emissions after 2012; instead countries like India and China have been told they, too, must all come up with quantifiable plans to cut their emissions – something not agreed before – and the rich seem to be ducking their commitments.</p><p>If the climate talks are a game of diplomatic chess, the rich countries have just moved their white queen into the back row of the developing countries' territory. But have they underestimated the reaction this will get? Can the G77 and China now gain diplomatic advantage? Are the industrialised countries threatening the talks by wanting it all their own way? Or will their bold move lead to a genuinely global agreement?</p><p>Bernarditas, who insists she does not represent the views of the G77, is appalled. For her, the US and EU are not just illegally abandoning an international treaty but they are now jeopardising the credibility of international law and the UN system itself. She is contemptuous. \"Do the rich countries have any sense of life in the least-developed countries?\" she asks. \"I doubt it.\"</p><p>\"I say, aren't we all in this world together? Didn't we all sign this?\" she says to a small audience in the UN coffee bar that morning, brandishing a&nbsp;well-thumbed copy of the 20-page Kyoto treaty.</p><p>She turns to page 7 where she has underlined paragraphs: \"Look!\" she says, jabbing the text with her index finger. \"Article 4. It says 'shall'. That is legally binding. There are obligations here. The words are not there by chance. And there's the word 'fully'. We spent hours on that word. We agreed on it. Are they saying it no longer applies? These are very serious negotiations. The Kyoto protocol is not a statement from a high-level meeting when they [politicians] go 'blah blah'. They are not bound by that. Here they are bound. It's law! Why do they now want to kill Kyoto? A new agreement means we will have to go through ratification all over again. How long will that take? What if you do not ratify? What are we left with? If you throw this away…? Every word in it means something important because it binds us to legal obligations.\"</p><p>To negotiate successfully at this level means you must understand your opponents and are able to argue all night. Bernarditas does that, but friend and foe say she has a special advantage because she is not only a stickler for detail but she knows the UN climate change convention and the Kyoto protocol word for word. And because her negotiating days go back to the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html\" title=\"Rio Earth summit\">Rio Earth summit</a> in 1992 when the first climate change treaty was signed, woe betide any young pup of a rich country negotiator who strays from the precise words.</p><p>\"She is the protector of the convention,\" says a colleague (in the world of diplomacy no one wants to be identified). \"I'd hate to negotiate against her. She reminds me of Humpty Dumpty when he said to Alice, 'When I use a word it means just what I&nbsp;choose it to mean – neither more nor less.' \"</p><p>A western friend, who also asks not to be named, says: \"She is used by the G77 and China as the bad cop, the experienced negotiator past whom the inexperienced, naive and unsuspecting cannot pass. She has an old style of Soviet negotiating. She can go on for 45 minutes easily. It's a&nbsp;method. It's attrition. Her start is from a stance of noncooperation. Success is seen as how much the opposition gives in, and how much you can extract. You have to start with something unbelievable and make concessions. Even the Americans quake in fear of her. She terrifies them.\"</p><p>Bernaditas herself says: \"Few people have dealt with the talks since the beginning [like me] and can still remember what we wrote. The majority don't see what we fought so hard for. [They say] this or that sounds reasonable. But I say that the words matter. They don't mean the same thing to everyone but they determine the levels of the relationship. There are words that do not appear that we talk about for hours.</p><p>\"I use their [the rich countries'] language. I spell it better. I don't make grammatical mistakes like they do. It angers them. I never get angry, I'm not subservient, nor impressed. They say, 'She cannot be right, she's only a woman and must be weak.' \"</p><p>\"Clearly she is successful,\" says a European observer. \"They would not employ her otherwise. But it would please the annex 1 [industrialised] countries a lot if she were not there. She is very dangerous to their interests. She doesn't hesitate to remind them all the time that they are in breach of their obligations. They roll their eyes and say, 'There she goes again.' \"</p><p>\"Actually, she's really like my mum,\" says a&nbsp;young Malaysian barrister. \"She is sweet but very authoritative.\"</p><p>Bernarditas de Castro Muller is a grandmother who lives in Geneva with her Swiss economist husband and is known among her colleagues for her sense of humour and babysitting skills. She has a house in Manila, and travels there regularly to see family, has lived in Kenya and worked as a full-time diplomat on just about every major global agreement on the environment of the last 20 years. Now, when she is not negotiating climate, she travels the world teaching diplomats from other developing countries how to negotiate.</p><p>\"I am only a housewife, actually,\" she says. \"My husband doesn't even trust me with the household budget. My education was totally western and I have spent most of my life in Europe. I am living in two worlds but I am at home in both. I see poverty and how people must live in developing countries but I am fortunately not poor.\"</p><p>Climate change is the most complex and satisfying of all the diplomacy she has done because it is science-based, it is about development, but mainly because there is so much at stake. Get it right, she says, and the world has the chance to both halt catastrophic climate change and find a better path to develop. Get it wrong and all the injustices and disadvantages that developing countries now face will be magnified 1,000 times in the coming years.</p><p>\"Climate change is making the poor even more vulnerable and threatening to destroy their health and their homes,\" she says.</p><p>She was persuaded to fight for climate justice when she went back to live in Manila after the downfall of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos\" title=\" President Marcos\">President Marcos</a> in the late 1980s. \"We happened to be chair of the G77. I listened to developing countries. I saw so much disadvantage there. The fact is they are very open and vulnerable. [It became clear] that the rich countries are freely exploiting, stealing practically, their resources. These countries do not have resources because they were so exploited in the past.</p><p>\"I now see developing countries who have so little… they get peanuts. They think if someone gives them anything they should be grateful. [But] developed countries have taken on obligations to provide money. This is not voluntary bilateral aid, or charity that we are negotiating from the annex 1 countries. This is a commitment.</p><p>\"When we were negotiating in the 1990s, all of us were caught up in environment and development. We were full of ideals. We said, 'Yes, we have to do something, because the world is getting lost.' Now I tell the developing countries that I am not working for them but for their children's children and what we will leave the world.\"</p><p>Even seasoned diplomats find the talks surreal, with an arcane language, logic and a pace of their own. In three years, they have gone well beyond being just about emission cuts and now embrace development, trade, finance, carbon markets, forestry, science and technology. Because they are so complex, most nations belong to one or another of the negotiating blocs, like the G77, the EU, the <a href=\"http://www.sidsnet.org/aosis/\" title=\"Association of small island states\">Alliance of small island states</a>, or the <a href=\"http://www.indigenousportal.com/Climate-Change/UNFCCC-Opening-Statement-AWG-KP-African-Group.html\" title=\"African group\">African group</a>.</p><p>Negotiators are mainly anonymous civil servants who have some freedom to set positions but can hide from their public, which is mostly denied access to the talks. They admit to personal duels and tactical manoeuvres. Phrases that might protect the world's forests or condemn nuclear power may be there one day, but be removed the next, and no one can say why or who is responsible.</p><p>But as the talks have progressed, so the negotiators admit to becoming lost in their own verbiage. There have been long debates over whether a comma, a colon or a semicolon should be used in the text; arguments have raged about the meaning of \"sustainable forest management\" as opposed to \"sustainable management of forests\"; and hours have been spent by nations debating the differences between \"economic development\" and \"sustainable development\".</p><p>Now the talks have invented their own language. There are Bingos (business and industry non-governmental groups) who discuss Mrvs (measurable, reportable and verifiable), Namas (nationally appropriate mitigation actions) and Napas (national adaptation programmes of action). One important section is known as Redd (reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation); another is called Lulucf (land-use, land-use change and forestry) which probably only 50 people in the world half-understand. Meanwhile, more than 100 \"non-papers\" have been issued which reflect nations' points of view without being formal positions.</p><p>\"It is easily the most complex piece of diplomacy ever devised,\" says one British diplomat. \"A set of interlocking negotiations taking place on parallel tracks, ranging from aviation to trade and forests to adaptation, finance and science. It's quite possible it will all collapse under its own weight.</p><p>\"There are many people who try to keep the language incomprehensible. There's a relationship between power and transparency – it's about keeping people out. The only people who really understand the lingo are the people who wrote it. It needs another industry of people to translate the words so they can be understood. I remember my first experience in the negotiations. I concluded after 25 minutes that I was in a madhouse. It was one of the most professionally disconcerting experiences of my life,\" he says.</p><p>He recalls seeing Bernarditas in action for the first time: \"There was what was called the Gang of Four – Bernarditas, a Chinese negotiator we called Professor No because he said no to everything, an Indian and a Saudi. They acted as the 'they shall not pass' group. Bernarditas was scary. You could imagine her as one of the Gang of Four in the Chinese upheavals. She and Professor No were fighting a 1960s ideological war in which the rich were trying to screw the poor and vice versa.\"</p><p>Several weeks later, this point was put to Bernarditas. \"What do they mean by ideological war?\" she thundered. \"What are they saying? They should specify. What do they not like? What do they mean by 1960s ideology? Fidel [Castro]? The opening up of traditions? Opposition to the colonial mentality? They have to specify what! No, I don't live up to their prejudices of what is a third-world woman, that's what they don't like about me.</p><p>\"But if they mean 1960s ideology in the sense of keeping economic gains, yes. They just do not accept they have historical responsibility. It's like I burn down your house and you become rich but now they say you can pay for it yourself. Well, you might be rich, but your brothers and sisters also lost their houses. Are you free from responsibility because one member of your family becomes rich?\"</p><p>She says the dice are loaded against the poor. Africa is experiencing climate change faster and deeper than almost anywhere else, and could be devastated within 30 years, yet its 55 countries have been offered no money by the rich to adapt and can afford to bring only 145 official delegates between them to Bangkok – just 8% of the total.</p><p>Europe, however, has more than 450 delegates, with the UK, Denmark and US numbering 142 between them. At least 50 countries have only one or two, but the WWF, a&nbsp;western conservation group, has a team of&nbsp;50 to lobby, observe and advise delegations, as&nbsp;well as to brief the press. In comparison with the EU or the US, the G77 has no offices, no permanent staff and no budget to meet in advance of conferences. Moreover, while delegates from poor countries must grasp highly complex technical issues in their second or even third languages, big country delegations may bring legal advisers, interpreters and business consultants for each area of the talks, with many more experts held in reserve.</p><p>The US or Japan may fly in people to advise them on the precise wording of a single paragraph, and as the talks reach their climax, rich countries will have whole teams of people to take it in turns to be on the frontline of the negotiations, staying fresh while their less well resourced opponents are exhausted.</p><p>\"Most developing countries don't have enough people, they don't even understand the text. They are exhausted after a few days and cannot even get to the meetings,\" says Meena Rahman from <a href=\"http://www.twnside.org.sg/\" title=\"Third World Network\">Third World Network</a>, an NGO based in Geneva which has followed the talks for years. \"They complain that they are marginalised, but there is nothing they can do. All the negotiations are in English and some just do not understand what is going on. It's accepted as a fact of life in the negotiations.\"</p><p>From a poor country's perspective, it is easy to suspect institutional bias. The executive secretary of the talks is <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/secretariat/executive_secretary/items/1200.php\" title=\"Yvo de Boer\">Yvo de Boer</a>, a Dutch diplomat, who himself has succeeded another Dutchman. His deputy is Canadian, and many of the senior secretariat and core groups are staffed by middle-aged white men. The media at the talks is mostly western and the language throughout is English.</p><p>\"Of course we complain all the time,\" says an African diplomat. \"If you control the process, you control the discussion and the texts. That's how you manipulate the outcome. It's very easy really.\"</p><p>Is this a sensible or fair way to go about re-ordering the world's economies to counter something as important as climate change? \"No,\" says an exhausted Swedish diplomat in Bangkok. \"It's quite mad.\"</p><p>As the talks conclude, the tactics get dirtier and the road to Copenhagen becomes increasingly ugly. Earlier this year, says Bernarditas, word was dropped by a British diplomat in a meeting with non-government groups that she was appearing overfriendly with the Saudi Arabian delegation because she had possibly accepted a house from them. The veiled accusation of bribery sped along the diplomatic grapevine. \"It was outrageous,\" says Bernarditas. \"I could not believe this.\"</p><p>But while she suspected a crude attempt to smear her, she was unable to prove anything and last week the head of the UK negotiations, Jan Thompson, said categorically that no official complaint had been received.</p><p>\"It's quite inconceivable. Bernarditas does not even need the money. She is incorruptible. That's why they hate her,\" says one of her colleagues. \"But she and the Saudis no longer sit near each other for fear that the rumours are restarted.\"</p><p>\"It's an idiot putting that about. It will backfire. God, how stupid can you get!\" said a British observer. \"It's below the belt… we should not think the Brits are immune [from these tactics].\"</p><p>Bernarditas herself stays aloof. \"Each one is looking for the weakness of the other. It's very vicious. But there are big commercial interests at stake. They exploit the weaknesses of people and exacerbate the differences between countries. It's part of the game,\" she says.</p><p>So, too, is the rhetoric now being employed by leaders of rich countries in the last crucial weeks before Copenhagen. In meeting after meeting, presidents and prime ministers have used apocalyptic language to insist that the future of the world is at stake and everyone must play their part. It plays well in the north, but in many developing countries it rings hollow, where it is seen as a&nbsp;precursor to blaming the poor if no deal is struck.</p><p>The rhetoric is reciprocated with the poor: \"Developed countries have overconsumed their share of the atmospheric space – they ate the pizza and left us the crumbs,\" said ambassador Anjelica Navarro of Bolivia. \"They have a historical debt – a historical responsibility. We want our atmosphere back, how you do that, developed countries, is your problem.\"</p><p>In a few weeks' time the talks will reconvene possibly for the last time in Copenhagen under the glare of the world's media and with the extra ingredient of high emotion brought by thousands of environment, human rights and development groups from around the world. But in diplomatic terms, the real talks are nearly over, having taken place behind closed doors between fewer and fewer countries. In the last month, there have been high-level meetings in London, Beijing, Delhi and Washington, with the US, Europe, Japan and the EU all trying to work out their position and agree what offer they are prepared to make.</p><p>\"They are now working together to split the developing countries, in order to weaken their political positions and isolate them before they make them offers and get their way,\" says Rahman.</p><p>The way this is being done, she says, is via those countries who are most vulnerable to climate change. The British in particular have worked with the Maldives to form a new grouping, known as the \"group of vulnerable countries\", a set of small island states and least developed countries who stand to disappear beneath the waves or be most affected by drought and flood. Next week, Bangladesh, Kenya and others will meet with British financial help in the Maldives, with rich countries invited to attend.</p><p>\"They can expect tempting sweeteners to break away from the G77, and threats if they do not play ball,\" says Meena Rahman, who is also a former chair of Friends Of The Earth International. \"It looks brilliant in PR terms. It looks like the British are helping the weakest but they are really peeling off the poorest and weakening Kyoto and the treaty.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/gwynn/\" title=\"Robin Gwynn\">Robin Gwynn</a>, UK special envoy for vulnerable countries, insists this is far too cynical a view, saying no country has done more than Britain to give the poor a real voice in the talks. \"The effort has been very genuine. The moral case must be made to ensure a global deal.\"</p><p>But another diplomat sees the tactical advantage in working with the poorest. \"If you can convince the most vulnerable countries that there is a serious funding offer on the table, then you can open up another front which helps a lot of third-party things. Tactics? It's never thought out before, it's always [negotiations] by the seat of the pants. There are too many events to react to. It's always chaotic. It's a weird game.\"</p><p>In the end, exhausted ministers from the three great power blocks, the US, the EU and China, will probably make a deal of sorts between themselves in the small hours of 17 December in Copenhagen. By then, the world's really poor countries will have long been diplomatically blown away from the negotiations with promises of cash soon and greater reward later. The G77 and its negotiators like Bernarditas will congratulate themselves for obtaining the best possible deal in the circumstances and the rich countries will insist the world is on a new, cleaner, greener development path.</p><p>There will be something for everyone because everyone wants something, and the politicians will be able to go home waving a communiqué that commits countries and industries to taking action to reduce emissions. Whether it is anywhere like enough, fast enough, to prevent a climate catastrophe, or is just or equitable, is another matter.</p><p>Because in western diplomatic terms, if there is not complete failure, then there can be one of only two outcomes to these climate talks. Copenhagen must be either a success or a great success. It may clearly be a fudge, or even a cop-out, but for the politicians who must sell it back home, nothing else in the world can be countenanced. <strong> </strong></p><p>• Join the 10:10 climate change campaign, which the Guardian is supporting, at <a href=\"http://www.1010uk.org/\" title=\" 1010uk.org/\">1010uk.org</a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2009/11/3/1257270069451/Climate-change-talks-illu-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/07/climate-change-talks-2009","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/07/climate-change-talks-2009","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Football puts goalline technology on hold for Uefa experiment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-30T00:10:02Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/2009/oct/30/digger-fifa-premier-league-technology","fields":{"body":"<p>Despite the comments this month from the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, that he wished to explore goalline technology again, the International Football Association Board – which presides over the sport's laws – last week decided the prospect was closed until their March 2011 AGM, which will be held in Wales.</p><p>The home nations make up half of Ifab's eight members, with the other four nominated by Fifa. A two-thirds majority is required to pass rulings. It was decided at their meeting to wait until at least the close of the Europa League's current experiment, in which Uefa has placed an extra assistant at each end, patrolling the goalline.</p><p>On 4 October Fiorentina's Alberto Gilardino scored a controversial \"phantom goal\" against Lazio in Serie A, which was disallowed after the referee and his assistant failed to see it had crossed the line. This prompted Blatter to say: \"We still haven't found anything which settles the problem. Now the inventor of Hawk-Eye [used in cricket and tennis] has said publicly his system would work. We will gladly take a look at it. He can demonstrate his system.\"</p><p>How the Premier League will greet the news is unclear. But the domestic governing body may well feel frustration that it will not be able to continue its own experiments with Hawk-Eye, which has already proved successful, in non-competitive football until the 2011 AGM.</p><p>With Fifa's authorization the League began testing technology – solely for goalline decisions – at Craven Cottage in 2007 before trials moved to Reading's training ground. The successful results were shown to Fifa's technical committee ahead of an Ifab meeting in March 2008 in Gleneagles. But Ifab turned down Hawk-Eye's technology.</p><p><h2>Notts County in the dark </h2></p><p>The plot thickens a little more at Notts County, with no one at the club able to identify an entity that could speak for Qadbak, the British Virgin Islands-registered company which is the owner of Munto Finance, the investment vehicle that acquired the League Two club. In good faith, of course, the always-helpful Mace Sports, which represents Notts County, suggested John West of Tavistock Communications may help with inquiries. But when contacted the chief executive said his company holds no brief for Qadbak and/or Notts County. Eagerly Digger returned to Mace Sports, but they were at a loss to know who speaks for Qadbak.</p><p><h2>Faraj lawyers no-show</h2></p><p>The Portsmouth chairman, Sulaiman al-Fahim, flies into London today and will meet Ali al-Faraj's financial adviser, who brokered the takeover of the club, tomorrow morning ahead of the home game with Wigan. The 32-year-old, who will seek further assurances from the adviser that there are monies available to keep the club afloat, is not meeting Mark Jacob. Faraj's lawyer and board representative is thought to have a previous engagement.</p><p><h2>FA does time warp</h2></p><p>As of 6pm on Thursday afternoon the FA's website at http://www.thefa.com/England/MensSeniorTeam/Fixtures.aspx appeared to have mastered what continues to frustrate the very finest quantum physicists: time travel. According to the official list of upcoming fixtures starting on Monday, 11 July 1966, Fabio Capello's England will play Uruguay, Mexico, France, Argentina and Portugal over a 15-day period before West Germany are due to be faced on Saturday, 30 July 1966. Although Digger is no soothsayer, there is a sense that this latter match could well be won 4-2 and prove a seismic (and heartbreakingly difficult to replicate) day in England's football&nbsp;history.</p><p><h2>Bolt goes on safari run</h2></p><p>Digger lunched with the great Usain Bolt at London's Design Museum yesterday afternoon. In town with Colin Jackson to promote the Long Run, an \"Ecosphere Safety\" drive from the Zeitz Foundation of Puma's chief executive, Jochen Zeitz's, Bolt was riveting company. He later flew to Kenya for a first visit to Africa.

helped bring down food prices from their peaks of 2007, but not by enough to stop the spread of hunger.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://docustore.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/newsroom/wfp209430.pdf\">new report</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/\">World Food Programme</a> says that undernourishment is still on the rise, and that there has been no progress towards the <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/mdg/goal1.shtml\">Millennium Development Goals on hunger</a>, or the target of hunger reduction set by last year's <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.HTM\">World Food Summit in Rome</a>.</p><p>The report says that although world food prices have dropped, the fall of local prices in developing countries have lagged behind, partly because food on world markets is priced in dollars and the dollar has appreciated slightly.</p><p>On top of that, the stress of living through the price peaks of earlier months, \"have stretched coping mechanisms of many poor families to the brink as they have been forced to draw down their assets.\"</p><p>The world's poor are now particularly vulnerable to a new rise in food prices when a global economic recovery gathers momentum. </p><p>This is the key data from the report: what can you do with it?</p><h2>Download the data</h2><p>• <a

murder rates tell us about a country? When they are as extreme as Colombia's or South Africa's, do they shape our perceptions of the place?</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/22/south-africa-worldcup-crime-fears\">Crime is rising in South Africa</a> less than nine months before the country hosts the football World Cup. But even with a murder rate dropping some 3% in recent years, South Africa still has one of the higher rates in the world.</p><p>So, who are the others? These figures, from the fantastic <a href=\"http://data.un.org/\">UNdata</a> give us an insight into the latest figures. But, of course, the results can offer different interpretations. If there's one area where you can find a figure to suit your prejudices this is it. The UN data includes figures from the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/en/\">World Health Organisation</a>, the UN and local police forces. So there is the South Africa murder rate on the summary chart below of 39.5 - and there is also a hugely different WHO figure of 69 murders per 100,000.</p><p>So, how did we choose what to summarise here? Where there is a conflict, ie two sets of numbers for the same year, we've put them in this order: Average figures first, then <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home/\">Eurostat</a> (the EU's statistics service) followed by the UN, WHO and then individual country reports. We've tried to be consistent in summarising the figures below - but if you want the full data, go to the Google spreadsheet and find out for yourself. </p><p>We want you to visualise this data - so let us know what you can do.</p><h2>Download the full data</h2><p><a href=\"http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=tAJzrYuGxXOGbU_HO2s_PrQ\">DATA: download the full list as a spreadsheet, including

All have won Nobel peace prizes in the award's (sometimes controversial) 108 year history.</p><p>The first African American to hold the US's highest office, Obama has called for disarmament and attempted – so far without success – to restart the stalled Middle East peace process. He is currently considering whether to increase troop numbers in Afghanistan where the US is mired in an eight-year-old conflict.</p><p>The choice of Obama for the prize from a field of more than 200 candidates astounded international commentators, in part because he took office less than two weeks before the February nomination deadline.</p><p>Well, here is the list of everyone who has ever won the nobel peace prize, ever, thanks to <a href=\"http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/index.html\">Nobelprize.org</a>. </p><p>We've added in sex and country.

The Nobel prize website lists only  the  year  and  winner(s)  but  we  decided  to include more detailed information  across  seven  columns. We showed joint winners separately and added the sex and country of each individual to make it easier for users to consider  different  ways  of  looking at the data. Unfortunately, when the creator (working as both author and editor) of the blogpost reorganised the information (copying it into  a  word file first, then pasting it into an excel file) and added the extra  details  about  the  recipients the names of some joint winners were accidentally  deleted,  although  their countries were included. He spotted two  missing  names John Raleigh Mott (1946, joint winner with Emily Greene Balch)  and  the  League  of  Red  Cross  Societies (1963 joint winner with International Committee of the Red Cross) a few minutes after the blogpost was launched. He also added \"The Quakers\" as a joint  winner  in  1947  (this  was later changed to \"Amer. Friends Service Cittee  (Quakers)\"). Unhappily, other missing names were not added for more than  four  hours  because  another  glitch - a Java error - meant that user comments could not be seen by either Firefox or Safari users and the blogpost author was involved in trying to fix this. Some time after 4pm this was done and he saw that people who had posted comments were pointing out that the names of  Shimon Peres  and  Yitzhak  Rabin  (1994,  joint  winners  with Yasser Arafat) and Menachem  Begin (1978, joint winner with Anwar al-Sadat) were also missing - he  added  these shortly  afterwards. Kofi Annan was joint winner with the United  Nations in 2001 and in error we listed his country as the USA, rather  than  Ghana. Our list also said that Bertha von Suttner (1905) was from  Switzerland, but she was actually from Austria-Hungary. Both of these country name errors were also corrected on 9 October. A further correction was made on 12 October to reflect the fact that José Ramos-Horta (1996, joint winner with Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo) is from East Timor as our list had omitted to include a country name for him.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/10/9/1255086912908/Nobel-Peace-Prize-medal-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/oct/09/nobel-peace-prize-winners-barack-obama","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/news/datablog/2009/oct/09/nobel-peace-prize-winners-barack-obama","sectionName":"News"},{"webTitle":"The world in muslim populations, every country listed","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-08T15:15:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2009/oct/08/muslim-population-islam-religion","fields":{"body":"<p>An American thinktank <a href=\"http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=450\">estimates there are</a> about 1.57bn Muslims worldwide – roughly 23% of the total 6.8bn population.</p><p>The study, by the <a href=\"http://pewforum.org\">Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life</a>, is based on census data from more than 200 countries.</p><p>Almost 62% of the world's Muslim population live in the Asia/Pacific region, compared with only 20% in the Middle East and North Africa (the historical cradle of Islam).</p><p>More than 300m Muslims – one-fifth of the total – live in countries where Islam is not the majority religion.

forest protection scheme at risk from organised crime, experts warn","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-05T16:00:15Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2009/oct/05/un-forest-protection","fields":{"body":"<p>A revolutionary UN scheme to cut carbon emissions by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/24/redd-reducing-emissions-from-deforestation\" title=\"paying poor countries to preserve their forests\">paying poorer countries to preserve their forests</a> is a recipe for corruption and will be hijacked by organised crime without safeguards, a Guardian investigation has found.</p><p>The UN, the World Bank, the UK and individuals including Prince Charles have strongly backed UN plans to expand the global carbon market to allow countries to trade the carbon stored in forests.</p><p>If, as expected, this is agreed at crucial UN climate change talks taking place in Bangkok this week  and concluding in Copenhagen in December, up to $30bn a year could be transferred from rich countries to the owners of endangered forests.</p><p>But experts on all sides of the debate, from international police to politicians to conservationists, have warned this week that the scheme, called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/24/redd-reducing-emissions-from-deforestation\" title=\"Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (Redd)\">Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (Redd)</a>, may be impossible to monitor and may already be leading to fraud. The UN itself accepts there are \"high risks\".</p><p>Interpol, the world's leading policing agency, said this week that the chances were very high that criminal gangs would seek to take advantage of Redd schemes, which will be largely be based in corruption-prone African and Asian countries.</p><p>\"Alarm bells are ringing. It is simply too big to monitor. The potential for criminality is vast and has not been taken into account by the people who set it up,\" said Peter Younger, Interpol environment crimes specialist and author of a new report for the World Bank on illegal forestry.</p><p>\"Organised crime syndicates are eyeing the nascent forest carbon market. I will report to the bank that Redd schemes are open to wide abuse,\" he said.</p><p>The significance of the felling of forests across great swaths of the world cannot be overstated - it is are responsible for about 20% of the globe's entire carbon emissions. With governments anxious to find new ways to meet increasingly stringent national emission targets, a scheme which promises to benefit poor countries, cut emissions cheaply and not require any new technology is highly attractive.</p><p>But most of the countries rich in forests are also home to some of the world's most corrupt politicians and uncontrolled logging companies, who stand to make billions of dollars if they can get Redd projects approved.</p><p>\"Fraud could include claiming credits for forests that do not exist or were not protected or by land grabs. It starts with bribery or intimidation of officials, then there's threats and violence against those people. There's forged documents too,\"  said Younger. \"Carbon trading transcends borders. I do not see any input from any law enforcement agency in planning Redd.\"</p><p>Hans Brattskar, director of Norway's forest and climate programme, whose country is financially backing the UN Redd programme, said last night: \"It will be extremely difficult to make it work. Law enforcement is vital because the corruption issued are very real. But we have to put in safeguards and we have to try. Redd can save up to 20% of all the world's emissions. Without it, I believe it will be impossible to reach the target of stemming climate change and holding global temperatures to 2C,\" the level judged acceptable by the European Union.</p><p>Last month, Papua New Guinea, one of the countries pushing hardest for Redd to be accepted in the UN climate talks, suspended their climate change minister after allegations that $100m of fake carbon credits had been handed to communities to persuade them to sign up to forest protection schemes.</p><p>Last night the UN admitted that Redd schemes were dangerously open to abuse. \"Where countries are corrupt the potential for Redd corruption is dangerous. [In Papua New Guinea], people have tried to take advantage of the market in an unacceptable way and carbon cowboys are trying to get the benefits. We can expect more of this as Redd develops,\" said Tiina Vahanen, a senior officer at UN-Redd.</p><p>People setting up Redd schemes also fear that they may be discredited by fraudsters aiming to profit from public money. \"The potential for Redd rape and pillage is staggering. Logging companies may turn into carbon companies. All they have to do is count, not cut. It's like giving a mass murderer money,\" said Rob Dodwell, a British conservationist setting up schemes in Kenya and Cameroon.</p><p>The UN estimates that 25% of the world's forestry emissions, or nearly 5% of total global carbon emissions, could be saved by 2015 if rich countries invest $15bn to set up Redd schemes.</p><p>So far rich countries have put up $52m to establish nine official pilot Redd schemes in Asia, Latin America and Africa. In addition several hundred private schemes are being set up by bankers, conservation groups,  and businesses who plan to offer carbon credits on the voluntary market.</p><p>But academics and environment groups with long experience working with the logging industry and indigenous communities said that both government and private schemes are being set up with no guarantees to protect communities who depend on the forests. \"Decisions are being rushed, communities are not consulted or compensated  and the lure of money from cutting emissions is overiding everything,\" says Rosalind Reeve of forestry watchdog group Global Witness.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-353898316'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2009/10/05/Deforestation.gif' alt='Deforestation' width='449' height='574' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/10/5/1254756485846/REDD-deforestation-in-Pap-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/05/un-forest-protection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/05/un-forest-protection","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"'Tilting at windmills: the boy who harnessed the wind'","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-02T23:05:20Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"theguardian/2009/oct/03/malawian-teenager-builds-wind-turbine","fields":{"body":"<p>Back in 2001 William Kamkwamba was&nbsp;a&nbsp;semi-educated 14-year-old Malawian who had been forced to drop out of secondary school when, during a terrible drought, his parents could no&nbsp;longer pay for him to go. This week, he has been in California and Chicago on&nbsp;a whirlwind book tour, hailed as a \"genius\" and appeared on TV chat shows. He has been the toast of international technology conferences, lauded by Al Gore and environmentalists and shared a stage with Bono and Google co‑founder Larry Page – as well as co-writing a book about his life, with journalist Bryan Mealer.</p><p>When Kamkwamba stopped going to school because his family could no longer afford the fees, he went to his local library, read up on his science, found a DIY guide to making a wind generator and set about trying to build it. Using a tractor fan, shock absorbers, PVC pipes, a bicycle frame and anything else he could lay his hands on, he then built a rudimentary wooden tower, plonked his home-made generator on the top, and eventually got one, and then four bulbs to light up. He is now known as \"the boy who harnessed the wind\" – the title of his book.</p><p>\"I managed to teach myself about how motors and electricity worked. Another book featured windmills on the cover, and said they were used to pump water and generate power. I was so inspired I began collecting scrap metal and old bicycle and tractor pieces. Many people, including my mother, thought I was crazy,\" he wrote in his blog this week.</p><p>Kamkwamba is presented to the west as the \"humble hero\", an extraordinary Malawian who has overcome everything to improve his family's situation, but the reality is that most of Africa, India and the developing world depends on equally innovative and inventive people coming up with ways to make a living with no cash and next to no resources.</p><p>In Katine, the Ugandan village which the Guardian supports, the weekly market sees Joseph with the bicycle he has adapted to become a knife sharpener; Matthew, who charges batteries with pedal power; and several women who strip plastic sacking to weave strong rope. The shells shot by the Sudanese army into Nuba territory in the late 1980s have all been collected and been beaten into farm tools, as have the tanks and guns handed in by soldiers after the Sierra Leone war in 2002. Mosquito nets throughout Africa now double as fishing nets. Masai villagers have devised a simple water distillation process by placing pipes over volcanic steam vents. Elsewhere in Africa, people make low-cost batteries from aluminium cans and plastic water bottles. Many Malawian and Congolese communities have devised ingenious ways to lift water from rivers and wells for irrigation.</p><p>How many British blacksmiths could fashion a tool which makes curved bricks to build round houses, as they do in Kenya? And how many IT managers could set up a DIY Wi-Fi phone network? In Tanzania, groups of women are learning to make and then adapt fireless cookers insulated with old clothes which save cutting down trees and can improve the air quality in their homes.</p><p>The Gingira district, just outside Dhaka in Bangladesh, is one of the world's least-known technological hotspots. Here, thousands of untrained people use rudimentary tools in small workshops (which would be condemned in Britain as unsafe) to make and copy everything from sophisticated car parts to watches and high fashion. Markets in Ghana, Senegal and South Africa are full of metal artists who take old pesticide cans and turn them into artworks, toys and gadgets.</p><p>Meanwhile, villagers in southern Bangladesh have found how to weave together water hyacinths to make large floating gardens on which they can grow food when their land is flooded. Sudanese innovators have developed what looks like a metal syringe to extract the seed pods from hibiscus plants because the flowers earn more money if the petals are left intact. Nepalese villages have developed gravity-driven rope ways which can move tonnes of produce several miles up and down steep mountainsides without electricity.</p><p>William Kamkwamba is the sort of child who would be welcomed to the Barefoot college in India, set up by educationalist Sanjit \"Bunker\" Roy. This takes some of the poorest, most uneducated people and taps into their traditional knowledge and practical resourcefulness to train them to become water and solar engineers.

(Physically carrying a DVD, which holds 4.7 gigabytes, across a room in a second would be a high \"download\" speed - but the time taken compared to the near-light speed of an electron means the latency is enormous.)</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/news/media/Press+Releases/Cisco+BQS+2009.htm\">study</a> splits the results of its tests, from taking 24m readings of broadband connection speeds between May and July in different countries, into five gradations: \"ready for tomorrow\" (with super-fast connections and low latency); \"comfortably enjoying today's applications\"; \"meeting needs of today's applications\"; \"below today's applications threshold\"; and \"leapfrog opportunity\". Those in the last category - including India, Egypt, Kenya and Nigeria - have the chance to make a generational change by installing completely new systems that will bring them up to modern standards.</p><p>The growth of streaming sites offering video, alternative reality sites such as Second Life, and sites such as Google Maps which can demand large downloads of code has put increasing demands on download speeds. At the same time the growth in social networking sharing of files such as photos and videos has put added emphasis on upload speeds - how fast one can get data from one's home computer onto a site. And latency is key when using applications such as video streaming like the BBC iPlayer, video calls or voice over internet telephony (VoIP), where dropped or delayed connections can destroy interaction.</p><p>The UK is among those with the widest penetration of broadband, with around 70% of households having it, but does not stand out for the quality of connectivity, the report found.</p><p>Joanne Hughes of Cisco told the BBC: J\"It can be a bit misleading to look at the rankings. The important thing is whether the broadband quality of a country is good enough for today's needs and the UK falls well within this category.</p><p>\"We forecast the UK will improve because of things such as cable networks being upgraded and the Digital Britain report focusing on next-generation access.\" </p><p>Under the Digital Britain plans, UK landlines will attract a tax of 50p per month which will be used to encourage the building of next-generation systems such as optical fibre connections to streets and homes that will be capable of download speeds of 100 megabits per second or more. Presently most people are promised maximum download speeds of 8Mbps - though the actual median figure is about 3.6Mbps, with a number of areas still unable to get broadband, and instead having to rely on dialup connections that run at about 2% of that average speed.</p><p>The Digital Britain report, unveiled earlier this year, proposed a minimum connection speed for any residence in the UK of 2Mbps - though that was criticised as unambitious by the internet industry.</p><p>The study found that the average global download speed globally was 4.75Mbps (megabits per second), while average upload speed was 1.3Mbps.</p><p>It is estimated that countries will need an average download speed of 11.25Mbps and an upload speed of 5Mbps in order to handle future applications such as high definition video. </p><p>The study also found that Sweden has the highest quality broadband in Europe, and is rapidly catching up with Japan and South Korea - the world leaders - as its BQS improves 38% from 2008. Sweden is the most successful country in closing the broadband quality gap with residents outside the most populated cities enjoying better quality than those in the cities. However London does not figure in the top 20 cities with the \"best\" broadband. </p><p>Professor María Rosalía Vicente, University of Oviedo, said: \"The Broadband Quality Study shows us which countries have made real moves towards the internet of the future. It also provides fresh evidence of the urban versus rural quality divide. The challenge for countries now is to bridge this quality divide.\"</p><p>You can download the <a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/NR/rdonlyres/99AAE7AC-C951-42CB-8F62-D43F51CEDE87/0/BroadbandQualityStudy2009PressPresentationfinal.pdf\">report</a> and its <a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/NR/rdonlyres/0353B17F-CAF7-4169-A294-9DAB696398A2/0/BroadbandQualityStudy2009Appendix.pdf\">appendix</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/news/media/Press+Releases/New+High-Quality+Broadband+Study.htm\">full study</a>.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/oct/01/uk-broadband-world-study-lags","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/oct/01/uk-broadband-world-study-lags","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"By 2050, 25m more children will go hungry as climate change leads to food crisis","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-30T03:30:00Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2009/sep/30/food-crisis-malnurtrition-climate-change","fields":{"body":"<p>Twenty-five million more children will go hungry by the middle of this century as climate change leads to food shortages and soaring prices for staples such as  rice, wheat, maize and soya beans, a report says today.</p><p>If global warming goes unchecked, all regions of the world will be affected, but the most vulnerable – south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa – will be hit hardest by failing crop yields, according to the report, prepared by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) for the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.</p><p>The children of 2050 will have fewer calories to eat than those in 2000, the report says, and the effect would be to wipe out decades of progress in reducing child malnutrition.</p><p>The grim scenario is the first to gauge the effects of climate change on the world's food supply by combining climate and agricultural models.</p><p>Spikes in grain prices last year led to rioting and unrest across the developing world, from Haiti to Thailand. Leaders at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh last week committed $2bn (£1.25bn) to food security, and the United Nations is set to hold a summit on food security in November, its second since last year's riots.</p><p>But the UN secretary general, Ban  Ki-moon, is pressing the World Bank and other institutions to do more. He said the industrialised world needs to step up investment in seed research and to offer more affordable crop insurance to the small farmers in developing countries. Though prices have stabilised, the world's food system is still in crisis, he said at the weekend.</p><p>\"Ever more people are denied food because prices are stubbornly high, because purchasing power has fallen due to the economic crisis, or because rains have failed and reserve stocks of grain have been eaten,\" he said.</p><p>Even without global warming, rising populations meant the world was headed for food shortages and food price rises.</p><p>\"The food price crisis of last year really was a wake-up call to a lot of people that we are going to have 50% more people on the surface of the Earth by 2050,\" said Gerald Nelson, the lead author of the report. \"Meeting those demands for food coming out of population growth is going to be a huge challenge – even without climate change.\"</p><p>After several years in which development aid has been diverted away from rural areas, the report called for $7bn a year for crop research, and investment in irrigation and rural infrastructure to help farmers adjust to a warming climate. \"Continuing the business-as-usual approach will almost certainly guarantee disastrous consequences,\" said Nelson.</p><p>The G20 industrialised nations last week began discussing how to invest some $20bn pledged for food security earlier this year.</p><p>Some regions of the world outlined in the report are already showing signs of vulnerability because of changing rainfall patterns and drought linked to climate change. Oxfam yesterday launched a $152m appeal on behalf of 23 million people hit by a severe drought and spiralling food prices in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Uganda. The charity called it the worst humanitarian crisis in Africa for a decade, and said many people in the region were suffering from malnutrition.</p><p>But southern Asia, which made great advances in agricultural production during the 20th century, was also singled out in the IFPRI report for being particularly at risk of food shortages. Some countries, such as Canada and Russia, will experience longer growing seasons because of climate change, but other factors – such as poor soil – mean that will not necessarily be translated into higher food production.</p><p>The report was prepared for negotiators currently trying to reach a global deal to fight climate change at the latest round of UN talks in Bangkok. It used climate models prepared by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia to arrive at estimates of how changes in growing seasons and rainfall patterns would affect farming in the developing world and elsewhere.</p><p>Without an ambitious injection of funds and new technology, wheat yields could fall by more than 30% in developing countries, setting off a catastrophic rise in prices. Wheat prices, with unmitigated climate change, could rise by 170%-194% by the middle of this century, the report said. Rice prices are projected to rise by 121% – and almost all of the increase will have to be passed on to the consumer, Nelson said.</p><p>The report did not take into account all the expected impacts of climate change – such as the loss of farmland due to rising sea levels, a rise in the number of insects and in plant disease, or changes in glacial melt. All these factors could increase the damage of climate change to agriculture.</p><p>Others who have examined the effects of climate change on agriculture have warned of the potential for conflict. In a new book, Plan B 4.0: Mobilising to Save Civilisation, published today, Lester Brown, founder of the Earth Policy Institute, warns that sharp declines in world harvests due to climate change could threaten the world order.</p><p>\"I am convinced that food is indeed the weak link,\" he said.</p><p>Brown saw Asia as the epicentre of the crisis, with the latest science warning of a sea level rise of up to six feet by 2100. With even a 3ft rise, Bangladesh could lose half of its rice land to rising seas; Vietnam, the world's second largest producer of rice, could also see much of the Mekong Delta under water.</p><p>Wheat and rice production would also fall because of acute water shortages, caused by past over-pumping and the melting of the Himalayan glaciers, which currently store water that supplies the region's main rivers: the Indus, Ganges, and Yangtse.</p><p>Brown said: \"The potential loss of these mountain glaciers in the Himalayas is the most massive projected threat to food security ever seen\" .</p><h2><strong>Global shortfall</strong></h2><p>People in both the developing and developed worlds will have less to eat by 2050 if climate change is not seriously addressed, though the shortfall will be relatively slight in richer countries. Prices rises and shortages of food will drive down the average calories available:</p><p>• The calories available for each person in industrialised nations will fall from 3,450 in 2000 to about 3,200.</p><p>• In developing countries overall, the average will fall from 2,696 to 2,410 calories.</p><p>• In sub-Saharan Africa, people will on average have only 1,924 calories a day, compared with 2,316 in 2000.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/9/29/1254258682992/A-malnourished-boy-at-a-f-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/30/food-crisis-malnurtrition-climate-change","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/sep/30/food-crisis-malnurtrition-climate-change","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand's best shot","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-23T22:00:02Z","sectionId":"artanddesign","id":"artanddesign/2009/sep/23/yann-arthus-bertrand-best-shot","fields":{"body":"<p>This is a picture of one of the worst things on the planet: the&nbsp;Athabasca oil sands in Alberta, Canada.

lines to get the data</strong>. </p><p>Looking at a country's total carbon emissions doesn't tell the full story of a country's contribution to global warming. </p><p>China, for example, is the world \"leader\" in total emissions (6018m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide) since it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/jun/19/china.usnews\">overtook the US</a> (5903) in 2007. But all that really tells you is that China is a fast-developing country with a lot of people. </p><p>A more useful measurement is carbon emissions per capita (person). Under that measurement, the average American is responsible for 19.8 tonnes per person, and the average Chinese citizen clocks in at 4.6 tonnes.</p><p>Examining CO2 per capita around the world also shows us the gulf between the developed world's responsibility for climate change and that of the developing world. While Australia is on 20.6 tonnes per person (partly because of its reliance on CO2-intensive coal) and the UK is half that at 9.7 (explained in part by relatively CO2-light gas power stations), India is on a mere 1.2. Poorer African nations such as Kenya are on an order magnitude less again – the average Kenyan has a footprint of just 0.3 tonnes (a figure that's likely to drop even lower with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jul/27/kenya-wind-farm\">the country's surge in wind power</a>).</p><p>These differences – along with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/aug/14/historical-total-co2-emissions\">countries' historical contributions to global warming</a> – are a crucial part of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/may/01/q-and-a-copenhagen-summit\">climate negotiations in Copenhagen</a> this December. Even the former UK deputy prime minister <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/aug/08/copenhagen-kyoto-climate-change-talks\">John Prescott recently said</a> that per capita emissions are the fairest way of thrashing out a deal in Copenhagen. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/aug/11/carbon-emissions-per-capita-prescott-australia\">Guardian readers believe</a>

the amount of carbon dioxide that countries put into the atmosphere over the past century might seem even irrelevant to modern climate change debates.</p><p>But historical emissions, like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita\">per capita emissions</a>, are a bone of contention in haggling between countries trying to reach a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/may/01/q-and-a-copenhagen-summit\">climate deal in Copenhagen</a> this December. Developing countries <a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.cn/ce/ceun/eng/gdxw/t568959.htm\">argue</a> that any CO2 cuts agreed by developed countries at Copenhagen should incorporate the principle of historical responsibility. In other words, the rich should pay in the near future for its considerable past contributions to global warming.</p><p>Data from 1900-2004 supports such an argument, when you keep in mind the size of countries' populations. The US has the biggest historical share (314,772m metric tonnes of carbon dioxide), while European countries such as Germany (73,625) and the UK (55,163) cast a shadow over developing nations such as India (25,054), Brazil (9,136) and Indonesia (6,167). China is on 89,243. </p><p>It's also worth bearing in mind that many developed countries' share of emissions go back before this data begins. As the leader of the industrial revolution, the UK in particular was responsible for significant carbon emissions in the 19th century.</p><p>To get a sense of how such emission debts are influencing the Copenhagen negotiations, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jQtnKDstFSWBJLaVndcOcla3GGTw\">consider the rationale given by Yu Qingtai</a>, China's climate change ambassador, when explaining that China would not drop its demands for tough CO2 cuts from developed countries: \"We have all along believed that due to the historical responsibility of the developed nations, they must continue to take the lead with large reductions beyond 2012.\" Some <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/aug/12/network-copenhagen\">commentators say</a> that if social justice is to be achieved at Copenhagen, it's impossible to argue against rich countries paying for their historic responsibility.</p><p>• <a

the fun of Africa's technology faire","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-19T17:30:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2009/aug/19/africa-technology-maker-faire-conference","fields":{"body":"<p>Bringing together the technological do-it-yourself ethos of <a href=\"http://makezine.com/\" title=\"Make magazine\">Make magazine</a> with the emerging development culture in Africa, Ghana played host to the continent's first <a href=\"http://www.makerfaire.com/\" title=\"Maker Faire\">Maker Faire</a>, a grassroots innovation conference.</p><p>Make magazine is from technology publisher O'Reilly, and it focuses on DIY projects with computers, electronics and robotics, with the odd bit of carpentry and metalworking thrown in. It's like a paper version of all the quirky do-it-yourself tech projects that you stumble upon while web surfing or find on Digg. In 2006 the magazine held its first Maker Faire, a DIY arts, crafts and technology festival, in the Bay area of California. The first UK faire was held in Newcastle earlier this year.</p><h2><strong>Practical thinking</strong></h2><p>The faire brings hardware hackers and art technologists together to create useful and whimsical projects. The Maker Faire in Ghana was practically focused with Africans from across the continent showing their inventions, including a low-power radio station, a bicycle-powered saw and a simple corn planter.</p><p>They even managed to solve some of their most pressing problems with little more than a few plastic bags.</p><h2></h2><p>If you want to get a glimpse into Africa's do-it-yourself development culture, the best place to start is <a href=\"http://www.afrigadget.com/2006/05/31/a-make-philosphy-for-africa/\" title=\"the blog AfriGadget\">the blog AfriGadget</a>. Launched in 2006 by Erik Hersman, who grew up in Kenya and Sudan, the site chronicles projects that solve \"everyday problems with African ingenuity\".</p><p>Hersman and the other bloggers at AfriGadget have highlighted hundreds of projects. One that caught my eye was a <a href=\"http://www.afrigadget.com/2009/06/01/distilling-water-from-volcanic-steam-vents/\" title=\"water distillation process\">water distillation process</a> that the Masai had created by placing pipes over the volcanic steam vents near Mount Suswa in the Rift Valley, Kenya. Water condenses on the pipes and then flows into drums. The simple set-up provides clean water for several hundred people and their cattle.</p><p>Ironically, one of Hersman's first posts highlighted Make magazine, which he described as the US version of AfriGadget. However, he also pointed to the differences between the American and African approaches to DIY gadgets. \"What's different about African mechanics and gadgetry is that it's generally made with much fewer, and more basic, materials. Where you might find a story on how to make hi-tech robots at home in Make, its counterpart in Africa might be how to create a bicycle out of wood. No less ingenuity needed, but far more useful for an African's everyday life,\" he wrote.</p><h2><strong>Bushpunk technology</strong></h2><p>The Maker Faire in Ghana helped combine the African and American visions of gadgetry. Conference organisers hoped to answer the question: what happens when you put the drivers of ingenious concepts from across the African continent together and add resources to the mix? The answer is instead of steampunk technology, you get bushpunk low-fi tech.</p><p>Shamsudeen Napara, from the north of Ghana, showed off the simple but excellent projects he builds in his metal shop. A $10 corn planter based on a pill dispenser helped speed up crop planting, while he also makes an inexpensive roaster for shea nuts — an important cash crop.&nbsp; Bernard Kiwia is a bicycle mechanic from Arusha, Tanzania. He has created windmills, water pumps, mobile phone chargers and pedal-powered hacksaws, all from old bike parts.</p><p>Some of the projects looked very similar to other faires, such as a low-power radio station set up by Hayford Bempong, David Celestin and Michael Amankwanor from Accra Polytechnic. They built a power inverter from scrap electronic parts and made an antenna from copper pipe.</p><p>A presentation from the <a href=\"http://www.afrobotics.com/\" title=\"Afrobotics\">Afrobotics</a> team was to inspire more African students to pursue studies in engineering, science and technology, and <a href=\"http://www.davidajao.com/blog/2009/08/17/mfa-2009-the-mozilla-team/\" title=\"African computer programmers working with the open-source Mozilla\">African computer programmers working with the open-source Mozilla</a> Foundation — creators of Firefox and open-source email client Thunderbird — came to promote their projects (http.</p><p>The faire was timed to coincide with the <a href=\"http://2009.iddsummit.org/\" title=\"International Development Design Summit\">International Development Design Summit</a>. Normally at <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/\" title=\"MIT\">MIT</a> in the US, the summit came to Ghana to bring technologists closer to \"potential end users of the projects\". Some projects from the summit highlighted at the faire included <a href=\"http://iddsummit.blogspot.com/\" title=\"a method for producing chlorine from salt water\">a method for producing chlorine from salt water</a> and other readily available materials. The chlorine can be used to purify water, and the summit also showed a simple system to purify large amounts of water. Using locally available materials and no moving parts, it's practical and robust.</p><p>They also created low-cost batteries from aluminium cans and plastic water bottles. Using salt water as an electrolyte, the battery generates electricity from the oxidation of aluminium and the reduction of water. It will save people money and reduce waste from commercial batteries.</p><p>Amy Smith of MIT <a href=\"http://www.afrigadget.com/2009/08/14/mfa-water-bag-design-challenge/\" title=\"threw down a challenge\">threw down a challenge</a> to teams of attendees. In 30 minutes, what problem could they solve with five plastic water bags? One team thought of using bags in a micro-hydroelectric project. Another suggested collecting the bags to create a pillow. Several thought the bags could be used for drip irrigation or to protect phones from the rain.</p><p>The faire also worked with the inventors to help them share and spread their technology ideas and to commercialise projects. It's a new take on development, one focused on helping local people solve local problems, and also build a livelihood with their ingenuity.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2009/8/19/1250700093550/Maker-Faire-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/aug/19/africa-technology-maker-faire-conference","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/aug/19/africa-technology-maker-faire-conference","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"The truth about mobile banking in Africa","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-14T08:00:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/blog/2009/aug/14/mobile-banking-africa-mpesa","fields":{"body":"<p>There has a lot written about mobile payments in Africa, particularly since the success of M-Pesa in Kenya (<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8194241.stm\">this BBC report has the basics</a>).</p><p>Mobile banking is certainly a growth industry across many African countries: indeed, my esteemed colleague Rick Wray reports that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/aug/13/african-mobile-banking-launch\">UK-listed Monitise is hoping to extend the reach of services</a> with a deal to run new systems across a number of African countries.</p><p>For Kenyans it is clearly an amazingly successful technology, and has generated all sorts of interesting opportunities for people who often live isolated rural lives or do not have access to the traditional banking structure.</p><p>However, despite the soaraway success of M-Pesa, mobile payments are still in their early days - and while Kenya has eagerly embraced the system, one swallow doesn't make a summer.

When complete in 2012, the £533m project will have a capacity of 300MW, a quarter of Kenya's current installed power and one of the highest proportions of wind energy to be fed in a national grid anywhere in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Until now, only north African countries such as Morocco and Egypt have harnessed wind power for commercial purposes on any real scale on the continent. But projects are now beginning to bloom south of the Sahara as governments realise that harnessing the vast wind potential can efficiently meet a surging demand for electricity and ending blackouts.&nbsp;</p><p>Already Ethiopia has commissioned a £190m, 120MW farm in Tigray region, representing 15% of the current electricity capacity, and intends to build several more. Tanzania has announced plans to generate at least 100MW of power from two projects in the central Singida region, more than 10% of the country's current supply. In March, South Africa, whose heavy reliance on coal makes its electricity the second most greenhouse-gas intensive in the world, became the first African country to announce a feed-in tariff for wind power, whereby customers generating electricity receive a cash payment for selling that power to the grid.</p><p>Kenya is trying to lead the way. Besides the Turkana project, which is being backed by the African Development Bank, private investors have proposed establishing a second windfarm near Naivasha, the well-known tourist town. And in the Ngong hills near Nairobi, the Maasai herders and elite long-distance athletes used to braving the frigid winds along the escarpment already have towering company: six 50m turbines from the Danish company Vestas that were erected last month and will add 5.1MW to the national grid from August. Another dozen turbines will be added at the site in the next few years.&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher Maende, an engineer from the state power company KenGen, which is running the Ngong farm and testing 14 other wind sites across the country, said local residents and herders were initially worried that noise from the turbines would scare the animals.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Now they are coming to admire the beauty of these machines,\" he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Kenya's electricity is already very green by global standards. Nearly three-quarters of KenGen's installed capacity comes from hydropower, and a further 11% from geothermal plants, which tap into the hot rocks a mile beneath the Rift Valley to release steam to power turbines.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently fewer than one-in-five Kenyans has access to electricity but demand is rising quickly, particularly in rural areas and from businesses. At the same time, increasingly erratic rainfall patterns and the destruction of key water catchment areas have affected hydroelectricity output. Low water levels caused the country's largest hydropower dam to be shut down last month.&nbsp;</p><p>As a short-term measure KenGen is relying on imported fossil fuels, such as coal and diesel. But within five years the government wants to drastically reduce the reliance on hydro by adding 500MW of geothermal power and 800MW of wind energy to the grid.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only are they far greener options than coal or diesel, but the country's favourable geology and meteorology make them cheaper alternatives over time. The possibility of selling carbon credits to companies in the industrialised world is an added financial advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Kenya's natural fuel should come from the wind, hot underground rock and the sun, whose potential has barely even been considered,\" said Nick Nuttall, spokesman for the United Nations Environment Programme. \"After the initial capital costs this energy is free.\"&nbsp;</p><p>The Dutch consortium behind the <a href=\"http://laketurkanawindpower.com/\" title=\"Lake Turkana Wind Power\">Lake Turkana Wind Power</a> (LTWP) project has leased 66,000 hectares of land on the eastern edge of the world's largest permanent desert lake. The volcanic soil is scoured by hot winds that blow consistently year round through the channel between the Kenyan and Ethiopian highlands.</p><p>According to LTWP, which has an agreement to sell its electricity to the Kenya Power &amp; Lighting Company, the average wind speed is 11metres per second, akin to \"proven reserves\" in the oil sector, said Carlo Van Wageningen, chairman of the company.&nbsp;</p><p>\"We believe that this site is one of the best in the world for wind,\" he said.&nbsp;If the project succeeds, the company estimates that there is the potential for the farm to generate a further 2,700MW of power, some of which could be exported.</p><p>First, however, there are huge logistical obstacles to overcome. The remote site of Loiyangalani is nearly 300 miles north of Nairobi. Transporting the turbines will require several thousand truck journeys, as well as the improvement of bridges and roads along the way. Security is also an issue as the region is known bandit country, and many locals are armed with AK-47 assault rifles.&nbsp;</p><p>LTWP also has to construct a 266-mile transmission line and several substations to connect the windfarm to the national grid. It has promised to provide electricity to the closest local towns, currently powered by generators.&nbsp;</p><h2>The greening of Africa</h2><p>At the end of 2008, Africa's installed wind power capacity was only 593MW. But that is set to change fast. Egypt has declared plans to have 7,200MW of wind electricity by 2020, meeting 12% of the country's energy needs. Morocco has a 15% target over the same period. South Africa and Kenya have not announced such long-term goals, but with power shortages and wind potential of up to 60,000MW and 30,000MW respectively, local projects are expected to boom. With the carbon credit market proving strong incentives for investment other types of renewable energy are also set to take off. Kenya is planning to quickly expanding its geothermal capacity, and neighbouring Rift Valley countries up to Djibouti are examining their own potential. As technology improves and costs fall, solar will also enter the mix. Germany has already publicised plans to develop a €400bn solar park in the Sahara.</p><p>\"Ultimately for Africa solar is the answer, although [costs mean] we may still be decades away,\" said Herman Oelsner, president of the African Wind Energy Association.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/7/24/1248435876635/ngong-wind-farm-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/27/kenya-wind-farm","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jul/27/kenya-wind-farm","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"What will broadband mean for east Africa?","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-24T11:00:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/blog/2009/jul/24/seacom-east-africa","fields":{"body":"<p>Forget the travails of technology giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple: the biggest news on the internet this week has been bubbling somewhere under the Indian Ocean. After years of development, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jul/23/east-africa-broadband-revolution\">a new 10,000 mile internet pipeline is bringing broadband to east Africa</a>.</p><p>Finally we can update our <a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2008/02/01/SeaCableHi.jpg\">lovely map of the internet's web of undersea cables</a>.</p><p>To say this moment has been long-awaited by netizens in Africa is an understatement: it's sending the continent into a frenzy. But what's the impact actually going to be?</p><p>To find out, I asked <a href=\"http://whiteafrican.com\">Erik Hersman</a>, the author of the <a href=\"http://www.afrigadget.com/\">Afrigadget blog</a> and founder of crisis information service Ushahidi - and as good as expert on the internet in east Africa as you're likely to find.</p><p>\"First, it will drive down business costs for organisations,\" he told me by email. \"I'm hearing of business high-speed internet costs dropping from $5000 per month to around $500-1000 now. That's pretty significant in and of itself.\"</p><p>\"Second, hosting can now feasibly be done in east Africa, instead of having to host all of the apps and services on European or American servers.\"</p><p>What about the knock-on effect on mobile development? We've heard a lot about successful mobile innovation in Kenya and other countries – payment system Mpesa <a href=\"http://technology.cgap.org/2008/06/17/why-has-m-pesa-become-so-popular-in-kenya/\">is the most famous example</a>, but there are others too. Would a sudden boost for internet service mean people turned away from mobile development? Hersman didn't think so.</p><p>\"The main reasons for that are that it's lack of regulation that allows services like Mpesa to come into being,\" he said. \"But, beyond that, it's also about what most consumers have. Yes, due to costs dropping we'll see more people getting access to the internet. However, the devices that people have access to on the personal level are still rudimentary (Nokia 1100-type) mobile phones.  It's not like those are going to all be thrown out and everyone upgrade to data phones all of the sudden. So, entrepreneurs will continue to build apps for those uses first.\"</p><p>He also noted that the Seacom installation hasn't been without controversy: nobody is yet clear whether increased access will drive down prices for ordinary people, and the company isn't releasing the names of cooperating ISPs – much to the chagrin of web-heads.</p><p>\"That lack of transparency is causing a bit of a problem,\" he said.  \"Kenyans tend to be great conspiracy theorists, so whispers of collusion and price fixing are already being bandied about.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/jul/24/seacom-east-africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/blog/2009/jul/24/seacom-east-africa","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"East Africa finally joins broadband revolution","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-23T18:14:39Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2009/jul/23/east-africa-broadband-revolution","fields":{"body":"<p><strong></strong>The jigsaw is finally complete. East Africa shed its tag as the only major inhabited coastline excluded from the global broadband map today when an undersea fibre-optic cable linking it to networks in Europe and India went live.</p><p>The commissioning of the 10,625-mile Seacom cable, which will soon be followed by two other submarine cables, is expected to drastically lower the cost of high-speed internet services and telephone calls. The region is currently dependent on expensive and often unreliable satellite links, which has prevented the spread of internet access.</p><p>The $600m (about £360m) Seacom cable, which is owned mainly by African investors, links South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Mozambique with London, Marseille and Mumbai. A separate undersea cable, known as Teams, owned by the Kenyan government and local telecoms firms and linked to the United Arab Emirates, is expected to go live next month.</p><p>In countries where much of the infrastructure has fallen into neglect since independence, the landing of the finger-thin fibre-optic cable has been hailed as a milestone. Aly-Khan Satchu, a financial analyst in Nairobi, compared its significance to the construction of the railway network in east Africa a century ago.</p><p>\"With the arrival of mobile phone and now broadband internet, we are leaping from the medieval age connectivity-wise into the 21st century in a very short period of time. This represents an enormous economic boost and a political game changer given how information is now going to be spread.\"</p><p>Local companies have been frantically laying down fibre-optic cable within and between cities in east Africa in anticipation of the undersea cables arriving, while internet providers have been slashing the cost of modems to try to sign up customers.</p><p>Seacom, whose completion deadline was delayed by a month due to the threat posed by Somali pirates to its cable-laying ships, said its wholesale customers were now paying 90% to 95% less per megabit than before.</p><p>Retail prices will also tumble, given the competition between the cable owners for customers and the vast oversupply of bandwidth. A third intercontinental cable, the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System, which will connect 21 countries in the eastern half of Africa to the global network, is expected to go live next year in time for the football World Cup when internet and broadcast traffic from South Africa is expected to rise dramatically.</p><p>The east African cables are among a string of projects across the globe to lay undersea cables, which use light signals to transmit data and carry more than 95% of voice and telephone traffic. One reason for the boom is the popularity of video download sites and services such as YouTube, which are causing worldwide bandwidth demand to double every 18 months. Another is the need for backup in case cables are accidentally severed, as occurred last year when a ship's anchor sliced two cables off Egypt, causing internet outages in the Middle East and India.</p><p>In Kenya, the cheaper bandwidth is expected to boost the nascent call-centre and outsourcing industry.</p><p>Internet service providers are hoping the growth in web usage can follow a similar path to that in the mobile phone sector, where the number of lines has grown from 15,000 to 17.4m – nearly one for every two Kenyans – in a decade. With laptops still too expensive for many people, it is expected that cheap, web-enabled phones will play a major role in spreading internet access.</p><p>Landlocked countries such as Ethiopia and Rwanda will soon be connected to the new cable, Seacom said.Facts and figures</p><p>Besides slow speeds, the main barrier to internet access in east Africa up to now has been cost. Even after recent price wars in Kenya, the most competitive market in the region, a 3G connection with the market leading telecoms firm Safari.com costs £55 a month for 5MB of data. The International Financial Corporation, which is funding the Eassy undersea cable that it is due to be connected to east and southern Africa next year, estimated that its cable alone would help triple the number of internet subscribers and cut costs by two-thirds. Internet users should be able to access a range of content previously unavailable. The Seacom cable that went live today has a capacity of 1.28 terrabytes per second, enough to \"open up the broadband tap\" and enable people to watch on-demand movies, share music and videos, and view news programmes in real time, the company said.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/23/east-africa-broadband-revolution","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/jul/23/east-africa-broadband-revolution","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"How the world is getting older: full ageing data","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-20T15:08:22Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2009/jul/20/population-older-people","fields":{"body":"<p>It's the fact that has demographers worried: the world's population is now aging at an unprecedented rate.

charts what it sees as the decline in production of cocaine and heroin but a rise in amphetamines and synthetic drugs.</p><p>The report finds \"seismic shifts\" in the cocaine market and a decline in the use of cannabis by young people in the United States and western Europe. It  examines the trends in use and seizures of all the major drugs and the changes in routes for trafficking. The survey provides evidence, according to the executive director of UNODC, Antonio Maria Costa, that drug use needs to be treated as an illness and that the traffickers rather than users should be targeted by law enforcement agencies worldwide.</p><p><a href=\"http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=raO73jlrVhTjBiJB7MP2Fbg\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a></p><p><strong>Can you do

people to go through the <a href=\"http://mps-expenses.guardian.co.uk/\">hundreds of thousands of documents that MPs have filed to claim for expenses</a>, but as we're seeing in Iran and have seen in places like <a href=\"http://rocketboom.wikia.com/wiki/Kenya_Crisis\">Kenya</a> and <a href=\"http://www.editorsweblog.org/multimedia/2008/04/burma_citizen_journalists_photos_tell_bu.php\">Burma</a>, people power can also provide crowdsourced coverage of a story. </p><p>You don't need to create your own platform to crowdsource crisis coverage, it's already been built for you, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.kenyanpundit.com/\">Ory Okolloh</a> and the team behind <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a>. Ushahidi, a word which means 'testimony' in Swahili, was created by Okolloh to help collect reports of violence in late 2007 and early 2008 in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2008/jan/02/kenya?picture=331929204\">contested elections in Kenya</a>. She asked people to e-mail or text her information so that she could post it on her blog, <a href=\"http://www.kenyanpundit.com/\">Kenyanpundit.com,</a> but she was quickly overwhelmed at the volume of reports. On 3 January 2008, she posted a plea to Kenyan 'techies' to help her, she told <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2009/06/knight-news-challenge-ushahidi-crowdsources-the-truth-when-reporters-arent-around/\">Jessica Roy at the Nieman Journalism Lab blog</a>.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Within 24 hours, I had responses from several volunteers, some of whom became part of the core team of Ushahidi. Within three days, the website was up and running.</p></blockquote><p>The platform takes allows people to easily submit reports via the web, email and SMS. It then plots the reports on a map. Ushahidi has now been used to report about xenophobic attacks in South Africa, Al Jazeera's 'Attack on Gaza' reporting in January 2009, the recent Indian elections and the swine flu reports from official and unofficial sources. </p><p>Ushahidi has been awarded <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/jun/18/research-newspapers\">$70,000 from the Knight News Challenge</a>, and Okolloh says it will allow them to fine-tune the platform. </p><blockquote><p>It will also allow us to see what happens when multiple installations of Ushahidi exist in a particular geographic area over a period of time — what happens when we merge the information together? Do patterns begin to emerge, e.g. links between poverty and crime? Do the groups we are working with begin to get creative about how they are collecting information? Does the platform allow for new information to emerge.</p></blockquote><p>The platform is free and open-source and <a href=\"http://download.ushahidi.com/\">freely available for download</a>. <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/join\">They are calling on developers</a> to help them improve geo-coding and timeline features, add new charts and graphs and help with Bayesian modeling so that reports can automatically be classified.

The panel included:</p><p>• Simon Spanswick, Chief Executive, Association for International Broadcasting, London</p><p>• Cristiana Falcone, Director Media and Entertainment Industries, World Economic Forum USA Inc.<br />• Tim Weber, Business editor, BBC News - interactive + radio, UK<br />• P N Balji, Director of the Asia Journalism Fellowship, Singapore<br />• Nick Brambring, Vice President Advertising and Regional Manager CEE (Central and Eastern Europe), <a href=\"http://zattoo.com/\">Zattoo</a>, Switzerland<br />• Salim Amin, Head of the pan-African media company <a href=\"http://www.a24media.com/\">A24</a> Media Nairobi/Kenya<br />• Axel Schmiegelow, CEO, sevenload, Germany</p><p>The moderator, Simon Spanswick, started the discussion with one of the more interesting facts I heard at the conference. There are more mobile handsets than television sets in the world.</p><p>Tim Weber of the BBC thought the question of whether the internet was a friend or foe was a \"false conflict\". The BBC was embracing new platforms because people weren't using its traditional linear platforms like they did in the past. He said:</p><blockquote><p>They use the internet, mobile phones, social networks. We cannot sit back and wait for the audience to come to us.</p><p>If we did not go into new media, there would be a guaranteed limited lifespan for what the BBC does.</p></blockquote><p>The BBC can only justify the licence fee if they maintain a certain level of audience. New media allows the BBC to have reach where it didn't have in the past. He gave the example of the United States where previously the only audience was short-wave radio enthusiasts. Now the US accounts for a significant audience online for the BBC.</p><p>One key thing to remember that trends in the US and Europe do not necessarily hold true in other parts of the world. PN Balji of Singapore said the use of traditional media there was still very high. He added:</p><blockquote><p>The tsunami that is hitting the media in the US is still a way off for Singapore. They know that it is coming, but they do not know when.</p></blockquote><p>Although broadband penetration is quite high in Singapore, the reach for new media is still not there. Furthermore, the media companies in Singapore are still quite cash-rich. They don't have a financial imperative to shift to new media, especially because they see that no one else has effectively monetised new media. Singaporean media companies will not go there without knowing where the money is.</p><p>Chinese and Indian companies are in much the same position, Balji said. The profits of mainstream news companies is still strong, and broadband penetration is still not what it is in the other countries.</p><p>Axel Schmiegelow, CEO of German video site <a href=\"http://en.sevenload.com/\">Sevenload</a>, said:</p><blockquote><p>Up until now, new media has been very destructive. It takes eyeballs away from traditional without providing the revenue to support the traditional media companies or journalists. Revenue per user is much lower in new media than traditional media. But that does not have to be the case.</p></blockquote><p>He said that Sevenload was making six figures in revenue per month. The site is niche TV, or put another way, \"channelised social media content\". Users can also connect based on content they like. People are willing to pay for relevant, high quality content, and advertisers are willing to pay higher ad rates than even in traditional media because users are being shown highly targeted advertising.</p><p>Another video model is that of Zattoo, which re-broadcasts television through its web service. Through geo-targeing, users are only able to see the content that Zattoo has a licence to show in a country. The site has four to 5m registered users with its home country of Switzerland having 1m. The service is ad supported, with users watching a short ad every time they switch between channels.</p><p>Salim Amin, head of A24 media in Kenya, said that Africa's big advantage is that it tended to leapfrog technologies. The continent didn't have a developed landline phone infrastructure, which is why it went directly to mobile phone technology. In what was a comment made by several Africans at the forum, Amin said that two undersea fibre-optic cables could will revolutionise the contienent.</p><p>His business appeals to advertisers who want a pan-African network, he said. But he has motivations beyond simply making money:</p><blockquote><p>We have to change the image of the continent. It's not just war and famine and HIV, and we need to content to change that image.</p></blockquote><p>Cristiana Falcone, of the World Economic Forum, went through the ways that the the forum had used new media in the last several years. They started with a podcast, which she admitted was basically an exercise in public relations. They then expanded their efforts to create the Davos conversation with the Huffington Post. Next, they invited Second Live to Davos. The Reuters Second Life reporter interviewed the forum's CEO in Second Life (even if the CEO didn't like his avatar). Last year, they branched out even further, using Flickr, Twitter and Facebook to host a distributed conversation. More than 6m people took part.</p><p>Looking to Barack Obama's winning presidential campaign, she said that media companies needed to take \"a portfolio approach\" that mixed the best of the old and new.</p><p>Spanswick pointed to how newspapers are getting into video, trying to build on their traditional businesses. What does this mean for broadcasters like the BBC?</p><p>Weber saw two trends. He said:</p><blockquote><p>If old media dies, it is because they cling to their distribution channel. They pray at the Church of the Dead Tree (a phrase he attributed to me).</p></blockquote><p>That doesn't mean that a newspaper should necessarily go online only. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer recently shut down its print edition and <a href=\"http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/891108/Hearst-prints-final-copy-Seattle-Post-Intelligencer-goes-digital/\">cut the newsroom staff from 150 journalists to about 20.</a> The site has very vibrant, blog and user-generated-content driven website, he said. But after they stopped the print edition, <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2009/04/20/daily19.html\">their website traffic fell</a>. Media companies need to take their content and spread it across platforms to survive, he said.</p><p>The other trend that he saw was that internet could make a jump from the study to the living room. Set-top boxes will become broadband-enabled. YouTube will make the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/jun/03/google-youtube\">jump to your regular television</a>. The BBC now has some programmes that are watched more on its on-demand service, iPlayer, than through the traditional television.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, you're not competing with 500 channels but almost an endless number of channels. He said:</p><blockquote><p>In the sea of digital choice, the one thing that will make you stand out is your brand. If you have a brand, then you will survive.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Fears for the future of newspapers</strong></p><p>Balji said:</p><blockquote><p>The biggest destroyers of journalism are the journalists themselves.</p></blockquote><p>Although the world has changed dramatically, if you look at the way that stories are written and the hierarchy is organised in most newspapers, it hasn't changed in 50 to 100 years. \"here is a lot of dinosaurs in our newsrooms.,\" he said. The challenges of today require a quantum leap in the business model, and he suggested that newspapers might shift to become non-profit organisations.</p><p>A member of the audience expressed concern about whether online news could fill the gap if newspapers shut down. He said: \"I am concerned about death of the dinosaur. I worry that major money that big newspapers used to spend on investigative journalism. Who is going to do that online in the future?\"</p><p>Falcone said that journalist remained very relevant. \"Someone still needs to contextualise events for a global audience,\" she said.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/jun/05/newspapers-television","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/pda/2009/jun/05/newspapers-television","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"@DW Global Media Forum: African mobile phone reporters","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-04T07:30:00Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/pda/2009/jun/04/mobilephones-b-of-the-bang","fields":{"body":"<p>One of the topics that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/jun/02/digital-media-mobilephones\">you said you wanted to hear about was mobile technology</a>, and one of the projects being discussed at the forum was called <a href=\"http://voicesofafrica.africanews.com/\">Voices of Africa</a>, which provided mobile phones and training to journalists in Cameroon, Ghana, Tanzania and Kenya.</p><p>The journalists are provided with a state of the art Nokia N-Series multimedia phone and a portable, foldable keyboard. Oliver Nyirubugara, the project coordinator, said that the project decided to use mobile phones because it was easy to train because everyone has a mobile phone. He said that the mobile phone has long since stopped being something that only the rich and the elites can afford.</p><p>Mobile phones are less intimidating than trying to train journalists to use more complex computer equipment. It's also self-contained. The phones can do basic text, audio and video editing. The phones can also connect to the internet, albeit over a sometimes slow GPRS connection. Sometimes it takes up to 45 minutes to upload a 10MB video file.</p><p>There are some downsides to using the phones. One problem was what Nyirubugara called the 'big camera' problem. Some journalists believe that you can only do proper journalism with a big camera. Also, the GPRS connections are either slow or non-existent in some areas. The reporters have to file from internet cafes.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the project has received 800 reports since May 2007.</p><p>The project hopes to generate income for the journalists, to strengthen local media and provide reporting on Africa by Africans.</p><p>The reporters, often reporting from within their own communities, do not have to learn the area and are able to gain access that would be impossible for foreign reporters, he added.</p><p>The project definitely has a feel-good factor, but Africans at the session put some sharp questions to the organisers of the project. The project was billed as helping to prevent conflict, but a member of the audience asked who in Africa could see the videos. And if people can't see the videos, how can they prevent conflict?

At the centre of the Earth, temperatures as hot as the sun are produced by the slow decay of radioactive particles. But the Earth is also warm much closer to the surface. Almost everywhere the upper 3m of the Earth is between 10C and 16C. As you go deeper, the temperature rises – up to 30C for every kilometre in the case of granite. Sometimes the energy reaches the surface in the shape of volcanoes, hot springs and geysers. For thousands of years, humans have used naturally occurring hot water, with the Romans, Chinese and native Americans using it for bathing and healthcare.</p><p><strong>How can geothermal energy be harnessed? </strong></p><p>Hot water that occurs near the Earth's surface can be piped directly into buildings and factories for heat: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/apr/22/renewableenergy.alternativeenergy\" title=\"Iceland\">Iceland</a> and parts of the US have long used hot water to heat homes and workplaces. It can be used for drying fruit, fish and timber and de-icing roads, and also to create other forms of power, such as electricity. The first geothermal electricity plant was built in Italy in 1904 at a place where natural steam was erupting from the ground and was used to turn generator turbines.</p><p>In flash-steam plants – named because some of the water can rapidly vaporise or \"flash\" – hot water is turned into steam to drive turbines and create electricity. When the steam cools it condenses to water and is injected back into the ground to be used over again. A second approach – and the one that will be used at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jun/01/eden-project-geothermal-energy\" title=\"\">the Eden Project</a> in Cornwall – involves passing hot water through a heat exchanger that warms up a second liquid. This second liquid is then more efficiently converted into steam to drive the turbine and generate electricity.</p><p><strong>What is an engineered geothermal system (EGS)? </strong></p><p>The traditional method of harvesting geothermal energy relies on finding naturally occurring pockets of steam and hot water close to the surface. EGS, by contrast, is simply a way of drilling down to the hot rocks in places where the heat does not naturally get to the surface. The geothermal scheme at the Eden Project has two wells dug up to 4km down. Water is injected into one, percolates through the hot rocks and the resulting hot water is then pumped up through the second well.</p><p><strong>What are its environmental benefits?</strong></p><p>Its champions claim it is a clean and efficient energy source. The water used is returned and replenished by rainfall and there is a vast amount of heat in the earth waiting to be tapped. Geothermal power plants do not burn fuel to generate electricity, so their emission levels are claimed to be low or nonexistent. The Eden Project's partner, <a href=\"http://www.egs-energy.com/\" title=\"EGS Energy\">EGS Energy</a>, claims the electricity and heat it produces will be from a renewable resource and is emissions-free. It says the surface footprint of its operation is also relatively small – a plant the size of a football pitch.

Those behind the Eden scheme believe that Cornwall could provide 10% of the UK's electricity for the next 100 years from geothermal plants. There are other granite basements in the north of England and north-east Scotland.</p><p>Suitable rock at reachable depths is also to be found in parts of France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Serbia, and the Rift Valley in Kenya is said to have the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/11/kenya-geothermal-energy-renewables\" title=\"potential to  generate at least 4,000 megawatts of electricity\">potential to generate at least 4,000MW of electricity</a>.

It's of her and Barack Obama planting an olive tree in Uhuru park in the city centre in October 2006. It could be any two celebrities posing for a routine photo call, but there is a strong connection between the spiffy, young American senator on his way to the White House and the flamboyant older woman dressed in canary yellow who had just become the first African woman to win a Nobel prize.</p><p>The link between them is known as the \"Lift\". In 1960, 300 Kenyans were awarded Kennedy scholarships to study at US colleges and universities. One of the first was a 22-year-old economics student called Barack Obama, a Luo from west Kenya who was picked to go to a college in Hawaii. With him was Wangari Maathai, a 20-year-old Kikuyu from the highlands heading for Mount St Scholastica college in Atchison, Kansas. Both stayed in the US for five years and both returned personally transformed to a newly independent Kenya.</p><p>It was a heady, liberating time. Obama Sr had just married a Kansan and fathered the boy who is now US president. Maathai returned with a masters and \"a determination to work hard, help the poor and watch out for the weak and vulnerable\". The spectacular results of the scholarship simply reflect, she adds, the potential of people anywhere to flourish if given the opportunity. In London this week for Prince Charles' climate change meeting with 20 Nobel laureates, Maathai, now nearly 70, cut a lone, if flamboyant, figure: she was the only woman, and with Wole Soyinka, one of only two Africans. Yet, she pointed out, it is women and Africans who must bear the brunt of climate change and pay for the west's profligacy. (About which, she had some interesting points to make. \"You must understand that what is happening in the west with the credit crunch has been happening for decades in Africa,\" she told her audience. \"The banks are not regulated. We cannot access money, and only a few people can buy houses. Europe is catching up with Africa. When we were campaigning against African debt we were told that it could not possibly be paid off. Many countries collapsed.\" As for western democracy, and Britain's parliamentary crisis, \"the elites have become predators, self-serving and only turning to people when they need them. We can never all be equal, but we can ensure we do not allow excessive poverty or wealth. Inequality breeds insecurity.\") </p><p>And while the scientists, academics and politicians talked of technological shifts and the need to bring the best brains in the world to bear on the problem, the former professor of biology at University of Nairobi said bluntly that the answers were known. \"We all know what to do. Why don't we do it? The question is, how are we to ensure something is done?\"</p><p>The reality, Maathai says, is that of the nine billion people expected to be on the planet in 2050, eight billion will be in what are now developing countries. \"Climate change is life or death. We could be accused of being alarmist, but if we have faith in science then something very serious is happening. Climate change and global warming is the new global battlefield. It is being presented is as if it is the problem of the developed world. But it's the developed world that has precipitated global warming. There will be a much greater negative impact on Africa because of its geography. But instead of adapting we are scraping the land, removing the vegetation and losing the soil. We are doing things to make it worse.</p><p>\"Besides, it's in the interests of the rich to help Africa adapt to climate change and preserve its forests. By allowing them to be destroyed a lot of the efforts made in the rich world will be negated and undermined.\"  </p><p>Maathai links ecology and culture and argues that the challenge for Africa (the title of her new book) is to look to itself and reclaim not just the land, but its cultures and resources. \"If the soil is denuded and the waters are polluted, the air is poisoned and the mineral riches are mined and sold beyond the continent, nothing will be left that we can call our own. Our real work is reclamation - bringing back what is essential so we can move forward. Planting trees, speaking our languages, telling our stories are all part of the same act of conservation. We need to protect our local foods, recall our mother tongues and rediscover our communal character.\" </p><p>Instead, \"some Africans are asking themselves whether we are being exposed to a new wave of colonialism,\" says Maathai. \"Yes, there is a grab for resources. We are vulnerable to anyone who wants to exploit us. It's like the 18th-century. Africa finds herself with raw materials but does not have the ability to add the technology. She cannot control the process. So she grinds herself without cash. Africa is paying in raw materials. She pays with her soil. In the past people entered Africa by force. These days they come with similarly lethal packages, but they are camouflaged to persuade Africa's leaders and people to co-operate.\" </p><p>The paymaster these days, she says, is China, which has invested tens of billions of dollars in the last decade to extract African oil, minerals, timber and land in return for roads and jobs.  \"China is really no different from the United States, the Soviet Union and the colonising European nations which facilitated the rise of African strong men and protected them in the post-colonial period, despite knowing of their corruption and cruelty, so they could continue to extract Africa's resources unhindered. If Africa had spent 40 years investing in education, acquiring skills, she would be in a better position now.\"</p><p>Maathai is western and African, local and international, a member of the elite and someone with a rural background, educated both in one of the world's richest and in one of its poorest countries. But her roots are in Ihithe, a village of peasant farmers near Nyeri in the foothills of the Aberdare mountains. The family home, where her sister now lives, nestles in a deep valley. There's a school, the By-Grace cafe, a few hundred houses, sheep on the roadside and tea plantations everywhere.</p><p>\"Mother lies there,\" she says. \"My relations live there. It's heaven. But people there do not appreciate it because we have a political and economic system that does not allow people to appreciate the beauty of where they live. That's the tragedy of poverty.\" </p><p>The changes that have taken place in Ihithe since the 1950s reflect the linked environmental and social crises now burdening so much of Kenya and the rest of Africa, she adds. \"I have seen huge changes. The population has grown enormously. All that area [around Ihithe] was wooded. There were small farms, full of maize, millet and sorghum. The rivers were huge and clean. There was no tea. Today we see tea, tea, tea. Mother never planted tea. Tea has become slave labour. Farming has become the production of a commodity which people cannot process or eat. You cannot process your own tea. Tea without good governance is serfdom and only leads to environmental and social problems.\"</p><p>But above all, she says, there has been deforestation, with the family woodlots grubbed up to plant tea and the hills all around denuded for firewood. Realisation that communities were destroying their own resources led her to start the Green Belt movement. What began as a few women planting trees is now a network of 600 community groups that care for 6,000 tree nurseries. They have together planted at least  30m trees on degraded private and public land, in reserves, and in cities all over Kenya.  The movement, which operates in 30 countries, is far more than a tree planting scheme: it has become an unofficial Kenyan agricultural advice service, a community regeneration project, and a job creation plan all in one. </p><p>\"There is a change taking place. We can hardly keep up with the requests [for help]. The tree is just a symbol for what happens to the environment. The act of planting one is a symbol of revitalising the community. Tree planting is only the entry point into the wider debate about the environment. Everyone should plant a tree,\" she says.</p><p>Since she won the Nobel prize, tree planting has become an essential for all countries wanting to flaunt green credentials. In 2007 she fronted a UN plan to have 1bn trees planted  throughout the world. Over 3.1bn have now been planted and the target has been revised to 7bn - one for every person on earth with a few left over - by the end of 2009.</p><p>In a tumultuous life as a pro-democracy and environmental activist, Maathai has been arrested many times, imprisoned, beaten, gone on hunger strike, had to barricade herself into her house to keep the police out, stood for president and been elected an MP. Her personal life has been equally stormy. She and her MP husband, who have three children, divorced years ago: he said she was much too strong-minded for a woman and that he was unable to control her. She called the divorce judge \"incompetent\" and was given six months in prison for contempt.</p><p>Now she is trying to protect the Congo forest, the world's second largest stand of trees. If the Congo goes, she says, not only will tens of millions of people lose their livelihoods, but the climatic effects would be catastrophic and be felt as far away as Britain and the US. Britain and Norway have together put up &pound;100m but it means working with some of the most war-ravaged and corrupt countries and companies on earth. </p><p>Ten African governments have asked her to their representative in the Congo basin initiative. \"I know they want to take advantage of the peace prize and raise the public awareness,\" she says. \"I know there is apprehension. But refusal to take up the challenge [of the Congo forest] would be wrong. I have no illusions. But there is no option.\" In the end, though, aid is not the answer. \"Donors come to be seen as Santa Claus, bringing with them money, materials and input. The people clap and dance in welcome until the tap runs dry. At the same time, donors' money can corrode responsibility. An attitude exists that one does not have to accountable for the use of funds that have originated outside the country. Individuals and governments misunderstand or subvert the donors' intentions.\"</p><p>Her message in London this week has been fierce and urgent. \"Nature is still being taken for granted. Yet when it is destroyed, life itself goes. Politicians [everywhere] are putting immediate needs ahead of the long term. We must challenge the decision makers. We must appeal not just to their heads, but to their hearts. I can only see getting worse things if we do nothing.\"</p><p>• The Challenge for Africa: A New Vision, by Wangari Maathai, is published by William Heinemann (RRP &pound;20).

We are confronting an historic economic crisis. We are fighting two wars. We face a range of challenges that will define the way that Americans will live in the 21st century. There is no shortage of work to be done, or responsibilities to bear. </p><p>And we have begun to make progress. Just this week, we have taken steps to protect American consumers and homeowners, and to reform our system of government contracting so that we better protect our people while spending our money more wisely. The engines of our economy are slowly beginning to turn, and we are working toward historic reform of healthcare and energy.  I welcome the hard work that has been done by the Congress on these and other issues. </p><p>In the midst of all these challenges, however, my single most important responsibility as president is to keep the American people safe. That is the first thing that I think about when I wake up in the morning. It is the last thing that I think about when I go to sleep at night. </p><p>This responsibility is only magnified in an era when an extremist ideology threatens our people, and technology gives a handful of terrorists the potential to do us great harm. We are less than eight years removed from the deadliest attack on American soil in our history. We know that al-Qaida is actively planning to attack us again. We know that this threat will be with us for a long time, and that we must use all elements of our power to defeat it. </p><p>Already, we have taken several steps to achieve that goal. </p><p>For the first time since 2002, we are providing the necessary resources and strategic direction to take the fight to the extremists who attacked us on 9/11 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We are investing in the 21st century military and intelligence capabilities that will allow us to stay one step ahead of a nimble enemy. We have re-energised a global non-proliferation regime to deny the world's most dangerous people access to the world's deadliest weapons, and launched an effort to secure all loose nuclear materials within four years. We are better protecting our border, and increasing our preparedness for any future attack or natural disaster. We are building new partnerships around the world to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and its affiliates. And we have renewed American diplomacy so that we once again have the strength and standing to truly lead the world. </p><p>These steps are all critical to keeping America secure. But I believe with every fibre of my being that in the long run we also cannot keep this country safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values. The documents that we hold in this very hall – the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights – are not simply words written into aging parchment. They are the foundation of liberty and justice in this country, and a light that shines for all who seek freedom, fairness, equality and dignity in the world. <br />I stand here today as someone whose own life was made possible by these documents. </p><p>My father came to our shores in search of the promise that they offered. My mother made me rise before dawn to learn of their truth when I lived as a child in a foreign land. My own American journey was paved by generations of citizens who gave meaning to those simple words – \"to form a more perfect union\".  I have studied the Constitution as a student; I have taught it as a teacher; I have been bound by it as a lawyer and legislator. I took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution as commander-in-chief, and as a citizen, I know that we must never – ever – turn our back on its enduring principles for expedience sake. </p><p>I make this claim not simply as a matter of idealism. We uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right, but because it strengthens our country and keeps us safe. Time and again, our values have been our best national security asset – in war and peace; in times of ease and in eras of upheaval. </p><p>Fidelity to our values is the reason why the United States of America grew from a small string of colonies under the writ of an empire to the strongest nation in the world. </p><p>It is the reason why enemy soldiers have surrendered to us in battle, knowing they'd receive better treatment from America's armed forces than from their own government. <br />It is the reason why America has benefited from strong alliances that amplified our power, and drawn a sharp and moral contrast with our adversaries. </p><p>It is the reason why we've been able to overpower the iron fist of fascism, outlast the iron curtain of communism, and enlist free nations and free people everywhere in common cause and common effort. </p><p>From Europe to the Pacific, we have been a nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law. That is who we are. And where terrorists offer only the injustice of disorder and destruction, America must demonstrate that our values and institutions are more resilient than a hateful ideology.</p><p>After 9/11, we knew that we had entered a new era – that enemies who did not abide by any law of war would present new challenges to our application of the law; that our government would need new tools to protect the American people, and that these tools would have to allow us to prevent attacks instead of simply prosecuting those who try to carry them out. </p><p>Unfortunately, faced with an uncertain threat, our government made a series of hasty decisions. And I believe that those decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that – too often – our government made decisions based upon fear rather than foresight, and all too often trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions. Instead of strategically applying our power and our principles, we too often set those principles aside as luxuries that we could no longer afford. And in this season of fear, too many of us – Democrats and Republicans; politicians, journalists and citizens – fell silent. </p><p>In other words, we went off course. And this is not my assessment alone. It was an assessment that was shared by the American people, who nominated candidates for president from both major parties who, despite our many differences, called for a new approach – one that rejected torture, and recognised the imperative of closing the prison at Guantánamo Bay. </p><p>Now let me be clear: we are indeed at war with al-Qaida and its affiliates. We do need to update our institutions to deal with this threat. But we must do so with an abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process; in checks and balances and accountability. For reasons that I will explain, the decisions that were made over the last eight years established an ad hoc legal approach for fighting terrorism that was neither effective nor sustainable – a framework that failed to rely on our legal traditions and time-tested institutions; that failed to use our values as a compass. And that is why I took several steps upon taking office to better protect the American people. </p><p>First, I banned the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States of America. </p><p>I know some have argued that brutal methods like waterboarding were necessary to keep us safe. I could not disagree more. As commander-in-chief, I see the intelligence, I bear responsibility for keeping this country safe, and I reject the assertion that these are the most effective means of interrogation. What's more, they undermine the rule of law. They alienate us in the world. They serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and increase the will of our enemies to fight us, while decreasing the will of others to work with America. They risk the lives of our troops by making it less likely that others will surrender to them in battle, and more likely that Americans will be mistreated if they are captured. In short, they did not advance our war and counterterrorism efforts – they undermined them, and that is why I ended them once and for all. </p><p>The arguments against these techniques did not originate from my administration. As Senator [John] McCain once said, torture \"serves as a great propaganda tool for those who recruit people to fight against us\". And even under President Bush, there was recognition among members of his administration – including a secretary of state, other senior officials, and many in the military and intelligence community – that those who argued for these tactics were on the wrong side of the debate, and the wrong side of history. We must leave these methods where they belong – in the past. They are not who we are. </p><p>They are not America. </p><p>The second decision that I made was to order the closing of the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay. </p><p>For over seven years, we have detained hundreds of people at Guantánamo. During that time, the system of military commissions at Guantánamo succeeded in convicting a grand total of three suspected terrorists. Let me repeat that: three convictions in over seven years. Instead of bringing terrorists to justice, efforts at prosecution met setbacks, cases lingered on, and in 2006 the supreme court invalidated the entire system. Meanwhile, over five hundred and twenty-five detainees were released from Guantánamo under the Bush administration. Let me repeat that: two-thirds of the detainees were released before I took office and ordered the closure of Guantánamo.  </p><p>There is also no question that Guantánamo set back the moral authority that is America's strongest currency in the world. Instead of building a durable framework for the struggle against al-Qaida that drew upon our deeply held values and traditions, our government was defending positions that undermined the rule of law. Indeed, part of the rationale for establishing Guantánamo in the first place was the misplaced notion that a prison there would be beyond the law – a proposition that the supreme court soundly rejected. </p><p>Meanwhile, instead of serving as a tool to counterterrorism, Guantánamo became a symbol that helped al-Qaida recruit terrorists to its cause. Indeed, the existence of Guantánamo likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. <br />So the record is clear: rather than keep us safer, the prison at Guantánamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies. </p><p>It sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries. By any measure, the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it. That is why I argued that it should be closed throughout my campaign. And that is why I ordered it closed within one year. </p><p>The third decision that I made was to order a review of all the pending cases at Guantánamo. </p><p>I knew when I ordered Guantánamo closed that it would be difficult and complex. There are 240 people there who have now spent years in legal limbo. In dealing with this situation, we do not have the luxury of starting from scratch. We are cleaning up something that is – quite simply – a mess; a misguided experiment that has left in its wake a flood of legal challenges that my administration is forced to deal with on a constant basis, and that consumes the time of government officials whose time should be spent on better protecting our country. </p><p>Indeed, the legal challenges that have sparked so much debate in recent weeks in Washington would be taking place whether or not I decided to close Guantánamo. For example, the court order to release seventeen Uighur detainees took place last fall – when George Bush was president. The supreme court that invalidated the system of prosecution at Guantánamo in 2006 was overwhelmingly appointed by Republican presidents. In other words, the problem of what to do with Guantánamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility; the problem exists because of the decision to open Guantánamo in the first place. </p><p>There are no neat or easy answers here. But I can tell you that the wrong answer is to pretend like this problem will go away if we maintain an unsustainable status quo. As president, I refuse to allow this problem to fester. Our security interests won't permit it. Our courts won't allow it. And neither should our conscience. </p><p>Now, over the last several weeks, we have seen a return of the politicisation of these issues that have characterised the last several years. I understand that these problems arouse passions and concerns. They should. We are confronting some of the most complicated questions that a democracy can face. But I have no interest in spending our time relitigating the policies of the last eight years. I want to solve these problems, and I want to solve them together as Americans. </p><p>And we will be ill-served by some of the fearmongering that emerges whenever we discuss this issue. Listening to the recent debate, I've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them; words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country. So I want to take this opportunity to lay out what we are doing, and how we intend to resolve these outstanding issues. I will explain how each action that we are taking will help build a framework that protects both the American people and the values that we hold dear. And I will focus on two broad areas: first, issues relating to Guantánamo and our detention policy; second, issues relating to security and transparency.  </p><p>Let me begin by disposing of one argument as plainly as I can:  we are not going to release anyone if it would endanger our national security, nor will we release detainees within the United States who endanger the American people. Where demanded by justice and national security, we will seek to transfer some detainees to the same type of facilities in which we hold all manner of dangerous and violent criminals within our borders – highly secure prisons that ensure the public safety. As we make these decisions, bear in mind the following fact: nobody has ever escaped from one of our federal \"supermax\" prisons, which hold hundreds of convicted terrorists. As Senator Lindsey Graham said: \"The idea that we cannot find a place to securely house 250-plus detainees within the United States is not rational.\" </p><p>We are currently in the process of reviewing each of the detainee cases at Guantánamo to determine the appropriate policy for dealing with them. As we do so, we are acutely aware that under the last administration, detainees were released only to return to the battlefield. That is why we are doing away with the poorly planned, haphazard approach that let those detainees go in the past. Instead, we are treating these cases with the care and attention that the law requires and our security demands. Going forward, these cases will fall into five distinct categories. </p><p>First, when feasible, we will try those who have violated American criminal laws in federal courts – courts provided for by the United States Constitution. Some have derided our federal courts as incapable of handling the trials of terrorists. They are wrong. Our courts and juries of our citizens are tough enough to convict terrorists, and the record makes that clear. Ramzi Yousef tried to blow up the World Trade Centre – he was convicted in our courts, and is serving a life sentence in US prison. Zaccarias Moussaoui has been identified as the 20th 9/11 hijacker – he was convicted in our courts, and he too is serving a life sentence in prison. If we can try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons, then we can do the same with detainees from Guantánamo.  </p><p>Recently, we prosecuted and received a guilty plea from a detainee – al-Marri – in federal court after years of legal confusion. We are preparing to transfer another detainee to the southern district of New York, where he will face trial on charges related to the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania – bombings that killed over 200 people. Preventing this detainee from coming to our shores would prevent his trial and conviction. And after over a decade, it is time to finally see that justice is served, and that is what we intend to do.  </p><p>The second category of cases involves detainees who violate the laws of war and are best tried through military commissions. Military commissions have a history in the United States dating back to George Washington and the revolutionary war. They are an appropriate venue for trying detainees for violations of the laws of war. They allow for the protection of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence-gathering; for the safety and security of participants; and for the presentation of evidence gathered from the battlefield that cannot be effectively presented in federal courts.<br /> <br />Now, some have suggested that this represents a reversal on my part. They are wrong. In 2006, I did strongly oppose legislation proposed by the Bush administration and passed by the Congress because it failed to establish a legitimate legal framework, with the kind of meaningful due process and rights for the accused that could stand up on appeal. I did, however, support the use of military commissions to try detainees, provided there were several reforms. And those are the reforms that we are making. </p><p>Instead of using the flawed commissions of the last seven years, my administration is bringing our commissions in line with the rule of law. The rule will no longer permit us to use as evidence statements that have been obtained using cruel, inhuman, or degrading interrogation methods. We will no longer place the burden to prove that hearsay is unreliable on the opponent of the hearsay. And we will give detainees greater latitude in selecting their own counsel, and more protections if they refuse to testify. These reforms – among others – will make our military commissions a more credible and effective means of administering justice, and I will work with Congress and legal authorities across the political spectrum on legislation to ensure that these Commissions are fair, legitimate, and effective. </p><p>The third category of detainees includes those who we have been ordered released by the courts.  Let me repeat what I said earlier: this has absolutely nothing to do with my decision to close Guantánamo. It has to do with the rule of law. The courts have found that there is no legitimate reason to hold twenty-one of the people currently held at Guantánamo. Twenty of these findings took place before I came into office. The United States is a nation of laws, and we must abide by these rulings. </p><p>The fourth category of cases involves detainees who we have determined can be transferred safely to another country. So far, our review team has approved fifty detainees for transfer. And my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation. <br />Finally, there remains the question of detainees at Guantánamo who cannot be prosecuted yet who pose a clear danger to the American people. </p><p>I want to be honest: this is the toughest issue we will face. We are going to exhaust every avenue that we have to prosecute those at Guantánamo who pose a danger to our country. But even when this process is complete, there may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted for past crimes, but who nonetheless pose a threat to the security of the United States. Examples of that threat include people who have received extensive explosives training at al-Qaida training camps, commanded Taliban troops in battle, expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden, or otherwise made it clear that they want to kill Americans. These are people who, in effect, remain at war with the United States. </p><p>As I said, I am not going to release individuals who endanger the American people. Al-Qaida terrorists and their affiliates are at war with the United States, and those that we capture – like other prisoners of war – must be prevented from attacking us again. </p><p>However, we must recognise that these detention policies cannot be unbounded. That is why my administration has begun to reshape these standards to ensure they are in line with the rule of law. We must have clear, defensible and lawful standards for those who fall in this category. We must have fair procedures so that we don't make mistakes. We must have a thorough process of periodic review, so that any prolonged detention is carefully evaluated and justified. </p><p>I know that creating such a system poses unique challenges. Other countries have grappled with this question, and so must we. But I want to be very clear that our goal is to construct a legitimate legal framework for Guantánamo detainees – not to avoid one. In our constitutional system, prolonged detention should not be the decision of any one man. </p><p>If and when we determine that the United States must hold individuals to keep them from carrying out an act of war, we will do so within a system that involves judicial and congressional oversight. And so going forward, my administration will work with Congress to develop an appropriate legal regime so that our efforts are consistent with our values and our Constitution. </p><p>As our efforts to close Guantánamo move forward, I know that the politics in Congress will be difficult. These issues are fodder for 30-second commercials and direct mail pieces that are designed to frighten. I get it. But if we continue to make decisions from within a climate of fear, we will make more mistakes. And if we refuse to deal with these issues today, then I guarantee you that they will be an albatross around our efforts to combat terrorism in the future. I have confidence that the American people are more interested in doing what is right to protect this country than in political posturing. I am not the only person in this city who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution – so did each and every member of Congress. Together we have a responsibility to enlist our values in the effort to secure our people, and to leave behind the legacy that makes it easier for future presidents to keep this country safe.  </p><p>The second set of issues that I want to discuss relates to security and transparency.</p><p>National security requires a delicate balance. Our democracy depends upon transparency, but some information must be protected from public disclosure for the sake of our security – for instance, the movements of our troops; our intelligence-gathering; or the information we have about a terrorist organisation and its affiliates. In these and other cases, lives are at stake.  </p><p>Several weeks ago, as part of an ongoing court case, I released memos issued by the previous administration's Office of Legal Counsel. I did not do this because I disagreed with the enhanced interrogation techniques that those memos authorised, or because I reject their legal rationale – although I do on both counts. I released the memos because the existence of that approach to interrogation was already widely known, the Bush administration had acknowledged its existence, and I had already banned those methods. The argument that somehow by releasing those memos, we are providing terrorists with information about how they will be interrogated is unfounded – we will not be interrogating terrorists using that approach, because that approach is now prohibited. </p><p>In short, I released these memos because there was no overriding reason to protect them. And the ensuing debate has helped the American people better understand how these interrogation methods came to be authorised and used. </p><p>On the other hand, I recently opposed the release of certain photographs that were taken of detainees by US personnel between 2002 and 2004. Individuals who violated standards of behaviour in these photos have been investigated and held accountable. There is no debate as to whether what is reflected in those photos is wrong, and nothing has been concealed to absolve perpetrators of crimes. However, it was my judgment – informed by my national security team – that releasing these photos would inflame anti-American opinion, and allow our enemies to paint US troops with a broad, damning and inaccurate brush, endangering them in theaters of war. </p><p>In short, there is a clear and compelling reason to not release these particular photos. There are nearly 200,000 Americans who are serving in harm's way, and I have a solemn responsibility for their safety as commander-in-chief. Nothing would be gained by the release of these photos that matters more than the lives of our young men and women serving in harm's way. </p><p>In each of these cases, I had to strike the right balance between transparency and national security. This balance brings with it a precious responsibility. And there is no doubt that the American people have seen this balance tested. In the images from Abu Ghraib and the brutal interrogation techniques made public long before I was president, the American people learned of actions taken in their name that bear no resemblance to the ideals that generations of Americans have fought for. And whether it was the run-up to the Iraq war or the revelation of secret programmes, Americans often felt like part of the story had been unnecessarily withheld from them. That causes suspicion to build up. That leads to a thirst for accountability. </p><p>I ran for president promising transparency, and I meant what I said. That is why, whenever possible, we will make information available to the American people so that they can make informed judgments and hold us accountable. But I have never argued – and never will – that our most sensitive national security matters should be an open book. I will never abandon – and I will vigorously defend – the necessity of classification to defend our troops at war; to protect sources and methods; and to safeguard confidential actions that keep the American people safe. And so, whenever we cannot release certain information to the public for valid national security reasons, I will insist that there is oversight of my actions – by Congress or by the courts.</p><p>We are launching a review of current policies by all of those agencies responsible for the classification of documents to determine where reforms are possible, and to assure that the other branches of government will be in a position to review executive branch decisions on these matters. Because in our system of checks and balances, someone must always watch over the watchers – especially when it comes to sensitive information.  </p><p>Along those same lines, my administration is also confronting challenges to what is known as the \"State Secrets\" privilege. This is a doctrine that allows the government to challenge legal cases involving secret programmes. It has been used by many past presidents – Republican and Democrat – for many decades. And while this principle is absolutely necessary to protect national security, I am concerned that it has been overused. We must not protect information merely because it reveals the violation of a law or embarrasses the government.  That is why my administration is nearing completion of a thorough review of this practice. </p><p>We plan to embrace several principles for reform. We will apply a stricter legal test to material that can be protected under the State Secrets privilege. We will not assert the privilege in court without first following a formal process, including review by a justice department committee and the personal approval of the attorney general. Finally, each year we will voluntarily report to Congress when we have invoked the privilege and why, because there must be proper oversight of our actions. </p><p>On all of these matter related to the disclosure of sensitive information, I wish I could say that there is a simple formula. But there is not. These are tough calls involving competing concerns, and they require a surgical approach. But the common thread that runs through all of my decisions is simple: we will safeguard what we must to protect the American people, but we will also ensure the accountability and oversight that is the hallmark of our constitutional system. I will never hide the truth because it is uncomfortable. I will deal with Congress and the courts as co-equal branches of government. I will tell the American people what I know and don't know, and when I release something publicly or keep something secret, I will tell you why. </p><p>In all of the areas that I have discussed today, the policies that I have proposed represent a new direction from the last eight years. To protect the American people and our values, we have banned enhanced interrogation techniques. We are closing the prison at Guantánamo. We are reforming military commissions, and we will pursue a new legal regime to detain terrorists. We are declassifying more information and embracing more oversight of our actions, and narrowing our use of the State Secrets privilege. These are dramatic changes that will put our approach to national security on a surer, safer and more sustainable footing, and their implementation will take time. </p><p>There is a core principle that we will apply to all of our actions: even as we clean up the mess at Guantánamo, we will constantly re-evaluate our approach, subject our decisions to review from the other branches of government, and seek the strongest and most sustainable legal framework for addressing these issues in the long-term. By doing that, we can leave behind a legacy that outlasts my administration, and that endures for the next president and the president after that; a legacy that protects the American people, and enjoys broad legitimacy at home and abroad.  </p><p>That is what I mean when I say that we need to focus on the future. I recognise that many still have a strong desire to focus on the past. When it comes to the actions of the last eight years, some Americans are angry; others want to re-fight debates that have been settled, most clearly at the ballot box in November. And I know that these debates lead directly to a call for a fuller accounting, perhaps through an independent commission. <br />I have opposed the creation of such a commission because I believe that our existing democratic institutions are strong enough to deliver accountability. The Congress can review abuses of our values, and there are ongoing inquiries by the Congress into matters like enhanced interrogation techniques. The department of justice and our courts can work through and punish any violations of our laws. </p><p>I understand that it is no secret that there is a tendency in Washington to spend our time pointing fingers at one another. And our media culture feeds the impulses that lead to a good fight. Nothing will contribute more to that than an extended re-litigation of the last eight years. Already, we have seen how that kind of effort only leads those in Washington to different sides laying blame, and can distract us from focusing our time, our effort, and our politics on the challenges of the future.</p><p>We see that, above all, in how the recent debate has been obscured by two opposite and absolutist ends. On one side of the spectrum, there are those who make little allowance for the unique challenges posed by terrorism, and who would almost never put national security over transparency. On the other end of the spectrum, there are those who embrace a view that can be summarised in two words: \"anything goes\". Their arguments suggest that the ends of fighting terrorism can be used to justify any means, and that the president should have blanket authority to do whatever he wants – provided that it is a president with whom they agree. </p><p>Both sides may be sincere in their views, but neither side is right. The American people are not absolutist, and they don't elect us to impose a rigid ideology on our problems. They know that we need not sacrifice our security for our values, nor sacrifice our values for our security, so long as we approach difficult questions with honesty, and care, and a dose of common sense. That, after all, is the unique genius of America. That is the challenge laid down by our Constitution. That has been the source of our strength through the ages. That is what makes the United States of America different as a nation. </p><p>I can stand here today, as President of the United States, and say without exception or equivocation that we do not torture, and that we will vigorously protect our people while forging a strong and durable framework that allows us to fight terrorism while abiding by the rule of law. Make no mistake: if we fail to turn the page on the approach that was taken over the past several years, then I will not be able to say that as president. And if we cannot stand for those core values, then we are not keeping faith with the documents that are enshrined in this hall. </p><p>The framers who drafted the Constitution could not have foreseen the challenges that have unfolded over the last two hundred and twenty-two years. But our Constitution has endured through secession and civil rights – through world war and cold war – because it provides a foundation of principles that can be applied pragmatically; it provides a compass that can help us find our way. It hasn't always been easy.  We are an imperfect people. Every now and then, there are those who think that America's safety and success requires us to walk away from the sacred principles enshrined in this building. We hear such voices today. But the American people have resisted that temptation. And though we have made our share of mistakes and course corrections, we have held fast to the principles that have been the source of our strength, and a beacon to the world. </p><p>Now, this generation faces a great test in the spectre of terrorism. Unlike the [US] civil war or world war II, we cannot count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end.  </p><p>Right now, in distant training camps and in crowded cities, there are people plotting to take American lives. That will be the case a year from now, five years from now, and – in all probability – ten years from now. Neither I nor anyone else can standing here today can say that there will not be another terrorist attack that takes American lives. But I can say with certainty that my administration – along with our extraordinary troops and the patriotic men and women who defend our national security – will do everything in our power to keep the American people safe. And I do know with certainty that we can defeat al-Qaida. Because the terrorists can only succeed if they swell their ranks and alienate America from our allies, and they will never be able to do that if we stay true to who we are; if we forge tough and durable approaches to fighting terrorism that are anchored in our timeless ideals.</p><p>This must be our common purpose. I ran for president because I believe that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together. We will not be safe if we see national security as a wedge that divides America – it can and must be a cause that unites us as one people, as one nation. We have done so before in times that were more perilous than ours. We will do so once again. </p><p>Thank you, God Bless you, and God bless the United States of America.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/05/21/obamaterrorspeech140x84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/21/obama-administration-guantanamo-interrogation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/may/21/obama-administration-guantanamo-interrogation","sectionName":"US news"},{"webTitle":"Victor Keegan: If Africa can cut out banks, why can't we?","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-29T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2009/apr/30/banking-technology","fields":{"body":"<p>Why isn't there a Pirate Bay for banks, where people can send money to each other without having to wait days for it to arrive? One of the continuing mysteries of the web revolution is why the equivalent of an eBay or Amazon hasn't emerged in the banking sector, where vast profits accrue - or used to accrue - to the middlemen. It is a rite of passage for younger people to swap music files, but never money, despite some interesting experiments, such as <a href=\"http://www.zopa.com\">zopa.com</a>, where borrowers can get money from lenders without banks being involved.</p><p>If you want to see pioneering experiments in banking you will have to go to a surprising place - Africa. And the question is, why can't we do the same here? If the Post Office is looking for a new role, it need look no farther. In Kenya, customers of M-Pesa can send money to each other from around the country in 14 seconds flat using their mobiles. In the UK it takes three days, thereby endowing the banks with a huge float of money in transit on which they can earn interest. In Kenya, people leave their money at a trusted outlet such as a shop or pharmacy, where it is loaded into their sim cards.</p><p>At a <a href=\"http://openmoodle.conted.ox.ac.uk/mod/forum/view.php?id=3\">Forum Oxford future technologies conference</a> at the weekend we were updated on the startling success of the operation. It is reckoned that 17% of the Kenyan population is on M-Pesa. As a result they don't need to carry cash any more, as everything from a can of Coke to your funeral can be paid for by phone. It works because the cash is held centrally by the bank, thereby enabling transactions to take place at very fast speeds. The average transaction is $30 (&pound;20) because people trust it to do big ticket items. </p><p>One of the bestselling handsets contains seven address books, each with a different ringtone, in recognition of the fact that phones are often shared among multiple users. In Lake Victoria there is a woman who travels from village to village by boat topping up phones. Fraud so far has been mercifully rare, although the system is far from perfect in other ways, as cash is not always available in the right place and the existence of lots of people with the same name in some places makes identity checks difficult beyond the phone and pin number you hold. It's a case of \"Le mobile, c'est moi\".</p><p>Kenya's experience is just one example of the amazing impact that mobile phones are having on economic growth in developing countries. A report commissioned by Vodafone, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/cash23\">India: The Impact of Mobile Phones</a> found that Indian states with high mobile penetration grow faster economically than those with lower penetration by as much as 1.2 percentage points a year for every 10% increase in the penetration rate. Even if that were only half true it is an astonishing tribute to the power of mobiles as an engine of growth.</p><p>Maybe it is because we are not used to the idea of technology transfer coming from poorer to richer nations that industrialised nations have been so slow to realise not only that Africa is leading the world in mobile banking, but that it has big lessons for us. I am surprised Vodafone, which is behind M-Pesa, hasn't introduced a similar service to the UK. It is also a dream opportunity for the government to turn the Post Office into a serious competitor to the banks. Your local post office would be the trusted place to put your money into the system. After that, practically every transfer can be made by mobile. And if anyone thinks it is too difficult - not something that happens much in Africa, it seems - then the Post Office will help out. </p><p>If Gordon Brown wants to turn the PO into a \"people's bank\" he need look no farther. Given the low esteem in which banks are currently held, there could be a stampede to join. And I'd be among the first. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.victorkeegan.com\">victorkeegan.com</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/30/banking-technology","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/apr/30/banking-technology","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Talks to free hero captain Richard Phillips from Somali pirates collapse","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-11T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2009/apr/12/somalia-pirates-hostage-richard-phillips","fields":{"body":"<p>Negotiations over the American captain taken hostage by Somali pirates broke down last night as the lifeboat in which he is being held edged closer to the Somali coastline.</p><p>The New York Times last night revealed further details on the discussions between officials from both countries, which foundered when American officials insisted the pirates be arrested. Elders representing the pirates refused.</p><p>Friends of Captain Richard Phillips told the newspaper of their worst fears with time running out before the lifeboat drifts closer to Gara'ad, a notorious pirate den in north-east Somalia.</p><p>Laura Wells, the owner of Wells Corner Market not far from Phillips's home in Underhill, Vermont, reacted with dismay to the news that negotiations had broken down. \"It unfortunately tells me that the captors feel they have some kind of advantage,\" she said. \"If the navy is going to do something, they better do it now, because they cannot let him get to shore. Once he gets to shore, he is lost, because we don't know where he would be taken. We can't lose sight of him.\"</p><p>With the captain's fate undecided, his vessel, the Maersk Alabama, a 17,000-ton cargo ship, pulled into port late on Saturday evening in Mombasa, Kenya, with its 19 remaining crew members. One, who did not identify himself, shouted to journalists waiting for the ship to dock: \"The captain is a hero. He saved our lives by giving himself up.\"</p><p>That self-sacrifice has struck a chord in a nation always keen to elevate a hero. The US media has had to dig back into history - to Thomas Jefferson's war against the Barbary pirates - to find an appropriate model for the crisis. </p><p>The huge interest in Phillips has come as pirates struck again yesterday, seizing a US-owned and Italian-flagged tugboat with 16 crew in the latest hijacking in the Gulf of Aden. And this weekend the danger of Phillips's continued captivity in a small boat from which he has once tried to escape was violently underscored by the death of a French maritime hostage, also held by pirates, who was killed in a rescue bid by French commandos.</p><p>The New York Daily News typified much of the US media by saying Phillips embodied \"the fine tradition of high seas heroism\". The normally staid Wall Street Journal called Phillips the \"American hero of the moment\". </p><p>Phillips seems an understandable choice of hero. A resident of the small town of Underhill, Vermont, friends have described him as a sports-loving regular guy. After long stints at sea he would return to New England to be a quiet-spoken ordinary Joe who loved basketball, playing golf and his family. </p><p>At sea, things were very different. Phillips has been described as a hard-driving consummate captain, well aware of the dangers lurking on the waters in which he plied his ships. He had been trained in anti-piracy measures and almost certainly put these into effect as his crew on the Maersk Alabama at first tried to fight off the pirates, then recaptured the vessel. He also showed astonishing leadership and selflessness by offering himself as a hostage so that his crew and vessel could be released unharmed. That act has elevated him into the modern pantheon of US heroes.</p><p>He joins the likes of Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger, the pilot who landed a plane in the Hudson river, Jessica Lynch, the woman soldier rescued in Iraq, and Pat Tillman, the American football player who became a Ranger and was killed in Afghanistan. Of course, no one knows how Phillips's drama will end. But, if it does end well, he may find the waters of celebrity heroism every bit as choppy as those off the Somali coast. Lynch now says the Pentagon exaggerated her story for propaganda purposes. Tillman, far from being killed by the Taliban or al-Qaida, turned out to have been shot by his own side in a tragic accident.</p><p>Phillips's adventure is an astonishing story. Amid all the problems Barack Obama thought would cross his desk, doing battle with Somali pirates on the seas of Arabia was probably not on his mind. In fact, the situation has come to symbolise many of the problems facing Obama and America in an increasingly unpredictable world.</p><p>If the American military attacked the Somali pirate vessel, there would be little doubt of the outcome, but that is not the point. Modern warfare, as suicide bombers, videotaped beheadings and carefully-placed IEDs have shown, is not about technology. It is about the willingness to kill and capture civilians. </p><p>In that sense, the stand-off is the perfect emblem of America's military problems in the world.

Thirty-six years later, the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) has become Europe's leading showcase and laboratory for low-energy devices and sustainable living, with 90 permanent staff, scores of volunteers and some 65,000 visitors a year.</p><p>But that was only one episode in Morgan-Grenville's adventurous, idiosyncratic and often hilarious life, which he exuberantly chronicled in his books. He had a taste for esoteric travel and egregious enterprises. The great-grandson of the last Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, Morgan-Grenville was often accused of betraying his establishment background. He ran a business converting and renting out barges for luxury holidays in France and railway carriages for tourist travel in Britain and in Russia. He offered adventure training in the Alps and in the Sahara desert, roamed exotic locations for an upmarket travel firm.  </p><p>Born at Iping, near Midhurst, Sussex, he went to Eton, where he was bored. His adventures and misadventures began at 19 as a 2nd lieutenant in the prestigious Rifle Brigade. Marching in a gala parade at Minden in West Germany, he could not maintain the Riflemen's fast pace and shortened his step, losing not only his own place in the parade but that of the whole battalion behind him, which became separated from the band and lost its way, to the malicious delight of the German citizens. </p><p>He was appointed aide-de-camp to General Frankie Festing (later the Chief of the Imperial General Staff) at allied headquarters in Paris, arriving for duty just after the Berlin airlift crisis of 1949, which could have led to war with the Soviets. Escorting Festing back to his quarters in pouring rain, the young subaltern found he had mislaid the key, so the general had to shelter overnight in a chicken coop. Both men lost their tempers, but forgave each other in the morning, and Festing's earthy and unpretentious manner became a lifelong model for the young officer.</p><p>After starting in business with spectacular success as a salesman, only to be fired when the firm went bankrupt, \"the holy writ of the career ladder somehow got lost along the way and, mercifully, was never re-found,\" Morgan-Grenville wrote in his autobiography Breaking Free (2001). Other books included a trilogy about barging in France. </p><p>He was an accomplished landscape painter, and the difficulty of hauling his still-wet canvases along Paris pavements gave him the idea of using river barges, which \"combined all the advantages of a house with those of a mobile studio, a constantly changing scene before its windows\". Barges became his livelihood after he bought a motorised craft in Holland, never having handled one before, and with a myopic and wildly unpredictable guide set sail across the landscape toward Belgium and northern France. The boats he hired out through the barging company he ran included the Fleur de Lys, which had four-poster beds, an onboard swimming pool and a chef.</p><p>Morgan-Grenville was nearly 40 when he became acutely aware of the environmental crisis, a susceptibility he attributes to his mother, \"who had long preached the need for humanity to live within the finite resources of planet earth. Simultaneously, I began to see my social world as rather superficial ... What I did not find was a willingness to do much more than talk.\"</p><p>He explored the hippy movement in Britain and the US, but failed to find practical solutions there and decided he preferred to use his own entrepreneurial skills for the cause. \"I decided to set up a centre where people, ordinary passers-by, might readily perceive the disastrous course on which our civilisation was set and be shown things they, anyone, might do to reduce their impact on the environment,\" he said. \"It was intended to show a range of practices which would have minimal adverse consequences both environmentally and socially. It was also proposed that books and pamphlets would be available for sale, and that those who lived and worked there would be as self-reliant as possible. There were just three difficulties; I had no staff, no place to put it and no funds.\"</p><p>When he had found the quarry, he obtained &pound;20,000 from his halfbrother, whose farm in Kenya had been destroyed by the Mau Mau. \"As soon as the grapevine spread the word that something was happening in a disused slate quarry in central Wales, volunteers started to arrive, unannounced, without tools, without skills and, mostly, without a penny to their name.\" Early visitors included the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales - and CAT was on the map. </p><p>Making use of his contacts in the establishment, he co-founded the Green Alliance with Maurice Ash, a former chairman of the Town and Country Planning Association, seeking to make the environment a central political issue. In 1983, he was appointed a Countryside Commissioner, first for England and then for Wales.</p><p>Morgan-Grenville recalled in his memoirs that in the middle of one winter he took a party of six to Rajasthan in India. \"It was, I suppose, an unusual party as it included my ex-wife Virginia, my present partner Fern and - although I had no idea of it at the time - my future wife, Margaret. It seems strange looking back, but it was greatly enjoyed by all of us - which says a lot for the delights of Rajasthan!\"</p><p>He is survived by his third wife, Margaret, and by two sons and a daughter from his first marriage. </p><p>• Gerard Wyndham Morgan-Grenville, environmental activist, born 26 March 1931; died 2 March 2009</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/3/25/1237976396820/Gerard-Morgan-Grenville-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/mar/25/gerard-morgan-grenville-obituary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/mar/25/gerard-morgan-grenville-obituary","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Madeleine Bunting: Leaders have not shown the courage to explain what the war really means","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-23T00:01:00Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2009/mar/23/afghanistan-military-terrorism","fields":{"body":"<p>Does the name Christopher Harkett mean anything to you? Or Thomas John or Graeme Stiff? They are the three casualties who took the total loss of British soldiers in Afghanistan over the 150 mark last week. Every week there is another; we glimpse the blurred shots of a young man smiling and hear the brief reference to Helmand, the regiment and the next of kin being informed.</p><p>As these deaths have become horribly routine in one of Britain's longest wars, it has become clear that no one knows what these men are dying for. It is now commonly accepted that this is a war which Nato is not winning; some go further and say it is unwinnable in any conventional sense. Barack Obama has declared the former, and is presumably pondering the latter as part of the review of Afghanistan policy in Washington expected to be announced in the next few weeks. David Miliband conceded last Friday on the Today programme that there is \"strategic stalemate in some parts of the country\". </p><p>That can be translated. It means British soldiers are conducting highly skilled, dangerous assaults that are largely well-planned and achieve narrow objectives of securing a particular village or road; they often involve casualties on both sides. The problem is these operations are almost entirely pointless - they serve no broader strategic purpose. </p><p>Take a case in point, at Nad-e-Ali just before Christmas, when three weeks of hard fighting in Operation Sond Chara (Red Dagger) secured several key areas from the Taliban, five British soldiers died and a reported 100 Taliban - it was declared a great victory. By the end of February there were reports that the Taliban had slipped back into much of the area. There is complete confusion as to what these soldiers are trying to achieve, argues Professor Anthony King, author of a book to be published later this year on European military force, From the Rhine to the Hindu Kush. </p><p>The confusion is shared by the public back home. How did we get into this? And how are we going to get out of it? None of these questions have clear answers now or any time in the foreseeable future; and, as fighting intensifies this summer from a resurgent Taliban, they will become more pressing. On the Today programme, Miliband stubbornly refused to give a target exit date: this war is stretching well into the future. </p><p>Part of the confusion can be traced back to 2001. For the Americans, this was a war of revenge, a demonstration of force to pursue Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. For the Europeans, it was nation-building, and the record here is dispiriting: of the $40bn pledged, only $15bn had been disbursed by 2008, and incredibly nearly half of that went to western consultants. Now it's an awkward muddle of two very different objectives with the 41 nations involved in the Nato operation providing their own interpretations. The war lurches from building schools and sewage systems one moment to accounts of kinetic force - blowing things up, bombing, killing - the next. Britain and America do more of the latter, Germany and the Dutch are keen on the former. Miliband bundled the two together last week without acknowledging that these objectives can conflict; bomb a village where there are al-Qaida suspects and you can destabilise the whole area, and turn civilians into enemy fighters. </p><p>To add to the confusion we don't even know who is our enemy and who is our ally. Taliban is a crude catch-all term which is of little help in Afghanistan's immensely complex, fragmented politics of tribe, clan and region. These groupings judge how best to secure their position and shift their allegiances accordingly. There comes a tipping point when significant groups go over to the Taliban, not out of a conversion to hardline Islamist ideology but because they offer more security than Nato; last year casualty rates among Afghans increased by 40%. Even the Afghan army, one of the few success stories of the war, predicted to double by 2012, has high desertion rates - no one can be sure we aren't training our future enemies.</p><p>What is clear is that this is an easy war for the Taliban. They may lack military technology but they don't need it; all they need is patience, men and weapons, and they have plenty of all three. They have none of the constraints imposed by European electorates on body counts; careless of their own men's lives, they can use the deaths of opponents and civilians to their advantage. Their best ally is European public opinion and its limited tolerance for this war. A long war of steady attrition - more blurred photos of smiling young men - and they could achieve their aims. </p><p>Increasingly, the objective of the war is being downgraded to nothing more ambitious than stabilisation: an Afghan state capable of exerting a degree of authority over local leaders and of containing the Taliban. Discreet negotiations are now reported, even with notorious warlords such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, as frustration with the Karzai regime deepens. It means compromising on corruption, human rights and even democracy; deals will be done with unpalatable characters who can deliver the necessary constituencies and that may compromise the effectiveness of aid. The best that could be hoped for is a \"different and in some ways better Afghanistan\", admits one strategy paper. It's a very modest goal and it comes at a very high price.</p><p>That's the nature of counter-insurgency: messy conclusions. It is a form of warfare which is lengthy, expensive in men and money, and about making political alliances, not winning victories; it certainly doesn't combine easily with idealism. This is why the liberal interventionism at the start of this war, with its mission to liberate women from their burkas, was so naive. </p><p>This was a war about which I was always sceptical, mainly because I studied some very unfashionable courses at university on the history of Britain's decolonisation. That's the history which the Americans are now belatedly examining; it's not an edifying story, and ultimately it contributed to destroying the legitimacy of the British empire. </p><p>Since Malaya and Kenya, counter-insurgency has become only more difficult with the advent of global media which can report the accidents and fatalities; the Guardian's Julian Borger reported from Afghanistan recently on how the Polish forces' hard work on winning hearts and minds was undermined by how local media reported an attack on a building which turned out to be a mosque. Months of careful work can be wiped out by a radio station.</p><p>This battle is fought as much in the media, local and global, as on the ground in Afghanistan. Will western electorates tolerate the confusion, modest aims and costly process of counter-insurgency? It is not war as they have understood it; there are no glorious victories and it is not even about winning.</p><p>As Paul Cornish pointed out recently in a thought-provoking article in International Affairs, counter-insurgency is a battle for legitimacy; it has to have a narrative both to the audience at home and in the country where it is operating. The former has been absent: the politicians have not had the courage to explain what this war entails and the public have not wanted to hear. But the very least we owe these young men is that they have a job which is both possible to do and achieves something worthwhile. Anyone care to explain?</p><p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@guardian.co.uk\">m.bunting@guardian.co.uk</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/23/afghanistan-military-terrorism","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/23/afghanistan-military-terrorism","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"The search for Africa's Einstein","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-17T00:01:00Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2009/mar/17/africa-international-students","fields":{"body":"<p>The year Marie Chantal Cyulinyana was 12 she didn't go to school. The 1994 genocide that cost her country, Rwanda, a million lives also put her education on hold. </p><p>She was lucky - she went back to school the following year. Many of her contemporaries never did. \"They had no parents, nowhere to live. Everything stopped for them. There were many, many,\" Cyulinyana says. </p><p>Olubode Adetunji - called Bode for short - faced a different challenge growing up in Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city. In Africa's most populous country, where there are 100 universities but few good jobs, only the best succeed.</p><p>Thousands of miles separated Cyulinyana and Adetunji as they grew up. But their fates were to be joined. Adetunji knew that he wanted to be an engineer, so he studied physics at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria's oldest university. Cyulinyana trained as a science teacher. She graduated with a degree in chemistry and physics teaching from the Kigali Institute of Education in 2007 and got a job at a high school in southern Rwanda. </p><p>But they both heard about an institute in South Africa where promising young scholars from all over the continent could develop their skills. </p><p>Adetunji heard about the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (Aims) through college friends, who had all applied to the Cape Town institute. </p><p>For Cyulinyana, the news came on the grapevine. \"I was told of a place for learning science in South Africa,\" she says. She would not have to pay for travel, board or tuition. It sounded too good to be true. Like Adetunji, she applied and was accepted. </p><p>Theirs is the sixth cohort to attend Aims, whose founder, Neil Turok, was given a prestigious award last year for his services to cosmology and to science in Africa. The Ted (Technology, Entertainment, Design) prize is given to three people every year who in some way have contributed to making the world a better place. Winners gets $100,000 (&euro;77,610) and a platform on which to make a wish to a collection of the rich and powerful, such as Bill Gates. </p><p>Turok, a Cambridge professor and the son of South African anti-apartheid activists, said he wished to see an African \"Einstein\" celebrated in his lifetime. He is convinced that the key to developing Africa lies in the brains of its youth - not those of foreign, mostly white, men. \"Without maths, Africa will remain on the margins, unable to compete in the modern world and dependent on others for the expertise and technologies it so desperately needs,\" he says.</p><p><strong>Focus on maths</strong></p><p>This explains the institute's focus on maths. Aims is a partnership between three South African universities, Stellenbosch, Cape Town and the Western Cape, and three European ones, Oxford, Cambridge and Paris-Sud-XI. At the outset, in 2003, the institute depended on foreign funders, but today most of its budget comes from the South African government. </p><p>The one-year programme has been designed to fill gaps left by students' first degrees, which often provide good theoretical skills, but little experience of applying them. English is on the curriculum, as is typing. There is an emphasis on computing skills, which can be hard to obtain in an African setting where students' time on the internet may be limited to an hour a week. The aim is to enable students to do postgraduate courses anywhere in the world. </p><p>\"My undergraduate degree was basically preparing for exams,\" says Adetunji. \"But here you learn an attitude of research. It's about creativity, curiosity, self-discovery and personal development.\"</p><p>Around 50 students are picked from hundreds of applicants each year. Aptitude is one criterion in the selection, but geographical distribution and gender also matter. Women are particularly welcome. This year 20 out of 53 students are female. </p><p>\"You can argue that women get an easier ride, but I think that in African countries women have had to work harder to get where these women have,\" says Fritz Hahne, the institute's director.</p><p>For many students, it is their first time away from their home countries. They eat, sleep and study together in a converted hotel a stone's throw from Cape Town's Muizenberg beach, famous for its white sand and surf - and great white sharks.</p><p>The spectacular setting helps attract visiting lecturers, who make up the entire faculty of Aims, receiving a stipend to cover expenses, but no real pay. They come from far and wide - this year from Oxford, Addis Ababa, Macau, Krakow, Zurich and Wisconsin, among other places. The courses taught at Aims are at the cutting edge of applied mathematics - finance featured this year, as did computational biology. </p><p>Teaching is far from a holiday, says Alan Beardon, a retired Cambridge professor who has been teaching the first-term course \"mathematical problem-solving\" since the institute was set up in 2003. The lecturers live in the institute and there are students around 24 hours a day. Sometimes, tutorials go on late into the night.</p><p>Beardon thinks the reason lecturers return year after year, despite the hard work and scant pay, is the feeling of contributing to something really worthwhile. \"There's great potential in Africa that's yet to be realised. The great thing about lecturing here is that you feel you are contributing to the realisation of that potential.\" </p><p>There are plans to replicate the Aims concept across Africa. The \"next Einstein initiative\" aims to create a network of 15 mathematical science centres. Locations for satellite campuses have been identified in Ghana, Sudan, Madagascar and Uganda. But finding funding is proving tough. \"It's maybe not such a good time, with the financial crisis,\" says Hahne. </p><p>A silver lining was the launch last year of the Aims research centre, across the road from the Muizenberg institute. The centre will specialise in mathematical modelling, with an emphasis on applications relevant to Africa, like disease modelling. At the launch, physicist Stephen Hawking said: \"Science needs Africa's talent.\" </p><p>But combining a fruitful career in science with contributing to the development of their home countries won't be straightforward for the students coming out of Aims. After they graduate, most want to continue their studies. Finding funding could prove a stumbling block. </p><p>Even if they do obtain a master's degree or a PhD, suitable jobs at home may be in short supply. One Tanzanian alumnus, who took a master's in disease modelling in South Africa, found herself overqualified for jobs when she returned home.</p><p>Hahne says that while Aims encourages students to return and make a difference in their countries, it does not frown upon those who can leave the continent. \"It would hardly be fair to deny them such opportunities,\" he says.</p><p>But most Aims students want to return. Christine from Togo wants to go into computer science. \"In 10 years, I would like to be teaching in my country, and also working as a software engineer,\" she says. Tabitha from Kenya would like to work for a large organisation, perhaps the World Bank, but long-term she wants to enter the civil service. \"I have a heart for politics,\" she says. </p><p>Eric from Madagascar wants to go abroad, but points out, \"You can do important things for Madagascar from abroad.\"</p><p><strong>Contributing to Africa</strong></p><p>Meanwhile, Adetunji has his sights on the oil and gas industries. He wants to \"imbibe the skills\" and earn some money in a developed country, but not stay permanently. \"I would like to come back and contribute to the development of Africa,\" he says. Cyulinyana also wants to return home eventually. \"I want to do something applicable, for example, renewable energy, so that I can help my country in that field.\"</p><p>It says something that Aims flourishes on a continent that is littered with the husks of well-intended initiatives that failed as soon as the funding from the west dried up. The success of students in ploughing their skills back into Africa's fertile soil will be key to secure the political support needed to expand the franchise.</p><p>Of course, a hundred African Einsteins will not bring back the brilliant minds lost in the killing fields of Rwanda, in Ethiopia's famines or in the HIV-ridden villages of Swaziland. But they could save future generations from the same fate.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/3/16/1237206851644/Olubode-Bode-Adetunji-lef-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/mar/17/africa-international-students","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2009/mar/17/africa-international-students","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Rolls-Royce ordered to fix Heathrow crash engines","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-12T17:11:02Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2009/mar/12/heathrow-crash-fuel-icing-delta","fields":{"body":"<p>Air safety authorities have ordered Rolls-Royce to urgently modify the family of engines involved in the Heathrow crash last year after a second plane in the US experienced the same loss of power caused by fuel icing.</p><p>It emerged today that a Delta Airlines flight avoided disaster in November after encountering the same problems that forced a British Airways Boeing 777 to crash-land at Heathrow airport on 17 January.</p><p>Peter Burkill, the pilot, was hailed as a hero after steering flight BA38 into Heathrow after losing power in both engines on approach. Thirteen passengers were injured but there were no fatalities among the 152 people on board.</p><p>The Delta aeroplane, travelling from Shanghai to Atlanta, was flying over Montana on 26 November when it experienced a sudden \"rollback\", or decrease in power, in its righthand engine due to fuel icing. The pilots restored power using safety instructions issued by Boeing after the Heathrow crash.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US has warned there is a \"high probability\" of it happening again. This afternoon its UK counterpart, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, called for a probe into fuel icing after warning that industry guidance on the problem was based on 50-year-old research.</p><p>British Airways has 15 out of the 220 Boeing 777-200 planes worldwide that use the engine, known as the Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 800.</p><p>\"With two of these rollback events occurring within a year, we believe that there is a high probability of something similar happening again,\" said the NTSB acting chairman, Mark Rosenker.</p><p>Rolls-Royce has said it expects to have a redesigned engine component ready within 12 months. Rosenker said: \"We are encouraged to see that Rolls-Royce is already working on a redesign.\"</p><p>The AAIB report, which followed the NTSB's urgent safety recommendation, makes five recommendations, including:</p><p>• A study into using anti-icing liquids in fuel for passenger aircraft.</p><p>• An investigation by US and EU authorities into why ice forms in aviation fuel.</p><p>• A probe by the same bodies into why ice forms in the planes' fuel systems.</p><p>In a second interim report into the Heathrow crash published this afternoon, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said \"soft ice\" had accumulated in the pipes that feed fuel into the aircraft engines. The ice, possibly formed as the plane flew in low temperatures over Siberia, could have been dislodged as the pilots sought an increase in thrust shortly before landing. Turbulence, shift in the pitch of the aircraft and temperature changes in engine components were also singled out as possible contributors.</p><p>The AAIB said it was possible that the ice was then flushed into the fuel oil heat exchanger, which warms plane fuel before it is injected into the engines, and subsequently blocked the plane's fuel supply just as it required more thrust to land.</p><p>Anti-icing additives are used in fuel by the military and some business jet operators. The AAIB asked the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US and the European Aviation Safety Agency to carry out the tests. \"Much of the current industry guidance is based on research undertaken over 50 years ago and since that time civil aircraft have become larger, fly for longer periods and incorporate new technology and materials.</p><p>\"In order to improve guidelines for the design and testing of aircraft fuel systems it will be necessary for the aviation industry, led by the regulatory authorities, to undertake a number of co‑ordinated research projects.\"</p><p>A Rolls-Royce spokesman said the AAIB report on the BA accident clearly stated that the Rolls-Royce equipment met or exceeded all requirements.</p><p>\"The report also highlights the emerging issue of ice build-up in commercial 'long-cold-high' routes. This is an industry-wide issue which requires detailed research that is likely to shape future regulations and requirements.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for British Airways said: \"We will work closely with the relevant authorities and will comply with requirements issued to all operators of Boeing 777s powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines.\"</p><h2>Boeing 777s used by major airlines</h2><p>American Airlines 47</p><p>Singapore Airlines 45</p><p>Cathay Pacific 17</p><p>BA 15</p><p>Malaysia Airlines 15</p><p>Thai Airways 14</p><p>Emirates 9</p><p>Delta 8</p><p>BOC Aviation (Asian leasing company) 6</p><p>El Al 6</p><p>Air New Zealand 4</p><p>Kenya Airways 4</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/02/18/plane84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/12/heathrow-crash-fuel-icing-delta","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/mar/12/heathrow-crash-fuel-icing-delta","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Case study: Boniface Kamau, 37","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-03T00:01:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2009/mar/03/mobile-phones-africa","fields":{"body":"<p>Boniface Kamau's bank is fast, efficient, and only shuts when it is out of power.

Vodafone's M-Pesa money transfer service was launched in Kenya in 2007 and now has 5 million users.</p><p>The ITU report points to the Gambia, where mobile subscriptions have rocketed amid stiff competition among mobile operators. Out of almost a million telephone subscribers, there are more than 800,000 mobile subscriptions but only about 50,000 fixed telephone lines in service.</p><p>Developing countries now account for about two-thirds of the mobile phones in use, compared with less than half of subscriptions in 2002.</p><p>The adoption of mobile technology has outstripped the growth of fixed-line connections, which rose from 1bn to 1.3bn over the same period, with market penetration stuck just below 20% for some years.</p><p>The figures demonstrate that many people in the developing world are bypassing the older technology altogether.</p><p>In the developed world, many people use more than one mobile device, with subscriptions exceeding population by 11% in Europe.</p><p>On the other hand, a single mobile phone may have several users in poorer countries, where handsets are sometimes shared or rented out by their owners.</p><p>\"There has been a clear shift to mobile cellular telephony,\" the ITU said. \"In contrast to the growth in the mobile sector, fixed telephony has experienced nearly no growth in the last decade.\" </p><p>The agency painted a positive picture of a world being opened up and given fresh opportunities by improved communications: \"The spread of mobile cellular services and technologies has made great strides towards connecting the previously unconnected.\" </p><p>The report also recorded a marked increase in internet use, which more than doubled from 11% of people using the net in 2002 to 23% last year. </p><p>Here the report identified a clear gap between the rich and poor world: fewer than one in 20 Africans went online in 2007, for instance, and less than 15% in Asia, whereas Europe and the Americas recorded penetration of 43% and 44% respectively. </p><p>Across the world just 5% of people have broadband internet at home, although this rises to 20% in the developed world.</p><p>In Africa, fixed broadband penetration stood at a mere 0.2% in 2007. But the report highlighted the potential of mobile broadband to expand the availability of high-speed internet access.</p><p>By the end of 2008, there were close to 335 million mobile broadband subscribers across the world, although not all of these would be users, the report conceded.</p><p>At the moment the developed world is far ahead, with 14% penetration in mobile broadband, compared with less than 1% in the developing world. The report found that there was a persistent \"digital divide\" between rich and poor countries in the use of communications technology. </p><p>Sweden was the world's most advanced country in the use of information and communications technology, in an index of 154 countries that took various factors into account such as access to computers and literacy levels.</p><p>South Korea and Denmark were placed second and third in the list, while the UK was ranked 10th.</p><p>\"Despite significant improvements in the developing world, the gap between the ICT [information and communication technology] haves and have-nots remains,\" the report said.</p><p>One problem it identified was that the cost of mobile and internet services in developing countries was relatively high  as a proportion of average income. The global economic downturn could also affect the development of communications technology if cash-strapped consumers cut their spending, the report said.</p><p>But its prognosis was relatively sanguine: \"Despite the economic downturn, current global ICT developments are unlikely to change drastically, given the pervasive nature of information and communication technologies.\"</p><h2>Calling Everest</h2><p>Then you hear your mobile. Being 29,198ft above sea level is no longer an excuse for not answering. In 2007 China Telecom installed a mast near the Everest base camp. </p><p>With 100,000 phone masts erected each year, the number of places with \"no signal\" is dwindling fast. \"More than 90% of the global population now has access,\" said Gabriel Solomon of mobile trade body GSMA. Even <strong>North Korea </strong>has lifted a ban, though access to handsets and international lines are heavily restricted.</p><p>Remote spots like <strong>Bhutan</strong> or <strong>Tibet</strong> are increasingly in reach. Networks are also covering Africa, with a $50bn investment in the sub-Sahara region alone. Only unpopulated areas like Antarctica or Chile's Atacama desert will remain off the hook.

His mobile money platform, <a href=\"http://www.beemme.co.uk\">Beem</a>, went live just two weeks ago; 1,500 people have signed up so far.</p><p>In Kenya, the M-Pesa service has attracted more than 4 million users in 18 months. This success has prompted similar launches in Uganda, Tanzania and Afghanistan. M-Pesa is separate from the banks, although it's possible to transfer money from one to the other. Many rural Kenyans do not have bank accounts, but they do have phones.</p><p>Edward Obiko, a 23-year-old engineering student at the University of Nairobi, uses M-Pesa about once a week. While it's not quite possible to stop using cash completely, he can see that time coming.</p><p>\"Just yesterday I paid for a course at Strathmore University in Nairobi using M-Pesa. And last month I paid to register a domain name with it,\" he said. \"It has also become popular as an online payment platform for Kenyan websites. Utility companies are encouraging people to pay bills through M-Pesa. Kenyans living in urban regions can send money to family members who live in rural areas with no bank or even no electricity. This, I think, is its most typical use.\"</p><p>M-Pesa operates through a network of agents who handle cash transactions linked to M-Pesa accounts. Anyone can register as an agent, and thousands of businesses and shops have done so.</p><p>Transactions are simple. All you need to know is the recipient's phone number and your own pin (which isn't stored on the phone). The network operator, Safaricom, takes a small variable fee for most transactions.</p><p>The UK version, Beem, is being promoted by Kerl Haslam. A veteran of the mobile phone industry and a former strategist at Orange, Haslam spent many years pondering the nature of mobile banking before starting his own business in 2002.</p><p>Although the bank payments organisation Apacs forecasts that by 2015 cash payments will have been overtaken by other forms, many challenges remain. And one key problem for the mobile network operators, Haslam says, is constant change. \"It's hard enough to get two networks to agree what colour the sky is, let alone standards for payments,\" he says.</p><p>Richard Martin, a business security consultant at the Payments Council, the body that oversees these standards, agrees. \"It's not the technology that's the problem,\" he says. \"There was an attempt to set something like this up a few years ago, called Simpay. All the big mobile companies backed it, but it fell apart because they couldn't make it stack up from a business point of view.\"</p><p>Haslam was against Simpay from the start, precisely because he knew how hard it was to get networks to agree. And this is why he thinks Beem will work: because it is independent. \"With us, it doesn't matter which bank, which network, which handset you use,\" he says. \"If you can send and receive text messages, you can use Beem. It's open to everyone.\"</p><p>Independence and simplicity sounds like an ideal combination, and the instructions for new users on Beem's website are impressively brief. But can it succeed without backing from the banks?</p><p>Beem's simplicity also exposes a weakness. To complete a Beem transaction, you must send a text with your Beem password in it. And to keep that password secret, you must remember to delete those sent messages. Every single time. If your phone is stolen with the password stored on it, the thief has access to your account.</p><p>Beem makes money by charging merchants a small fee per transaction, just as the banks do, but there's no fee for person-to-person transfers. Interest has been strong from taxi and pizza-delivery firms keen to avoid their drivers carrying cash. Haslam himself makes a habit of sending small sums, or phone credit top-ups, to his teenage children.</p><p>Simpay failed for the network operators, but the banks - despite their wider worries about the global economy - are watching with a close eye. There's not the demand for direct person-to-person payments here that there is in Kenya; but perhaps, given the right tools to make such payments easy, there may be.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/feb/19/m-pesa-mobile-money-transfer","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/feb/19/m-pesa-mobile-money-transfer","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"India to launch credit crunch £7 laptop, world's cheapest computer","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-02T16:37:00Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2009/feb/02/india-computer-cheapest","fields":{"body":"<p><strong></strong>The credit crunch computer is set to  arrive tomorrow  in India when officials unveil the 500 rupee (£7.25) laptop.

This envisages a network of laptops from which students can access lectures, coursework and specialist help from anywhere in India, triggering a revolution in education. A number of publishers have reportedly agreed to upload portions of their textbooks on to the system.</p><p>Prabhakar Rao, vice-chancellor of the university in Andhra Pradesh from where the Sakshat will be launched, said that India was \"looking to get the hardware and software cheaper. In a developing country, costs have to be kept low so that the maximum number of students will benefit. That means cheap computers and cheap broadband access, so that students get access to ebooks and ejournals.\"</p><p>Although half of India's 1 billion people are aged below 25, the country has fallen behind in terms of university places, with only 11% of students enrolled, compared with double that in China. India's bigger northern neighbour already has 180 million internet users, five times India's total.</p><p>Designed by scientists at the Vellore Institute of Technology, the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras and the state-controlled Semiconductor Complex, the laptop has 2Gb of Ram and wireless connectivity. In an attempt to keep costs low, experts say it is unlikely to use familiar Microsoft Windows software.</p><p>Officials are confident that the Rs500 price tag can be met. RP Agarwal, the top civil servant for Indian higher education, told newspapers last week that \"at this stage, the price is working out to be $20 [Rs1,000] but with mass production it is bound to come down.\"</p><p>The Indian machine would also be considerably cheaper than the \"$100 laptop\", the lime-green computer known as the Children's Machine or XO that was designed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US.</p><p>Launched in 2005 in a flurry of praise by Nicholas Negroponte, the former director of MIT's Media Lab, the XO has failed to take off, partly because it costs $200 (£141) to make. However it has given rise to low-cost computers that save money by getting rid of hard drives and using cheap screens. The Classmate PC made by Intel, the world's biggest microchip manufacturer, can be bought for $400. Taiwan's Eee PC costs as little as $200.</p><p>However, some experts doubt that a laptop at $20 or $10 is commercially sustainable. Rajesh Jain, managing director of Netcore Solutions and a pioneer of low-cost computing in India, said: \"You cannot even [make] a computer screen for $20. And India does not build much computer hardware. So where will the savings come from?\"</p><p>Some bloggers today saw the new laptop as nothing more than a \"souped up calculator\". The scepticism was summed up by Atanu Dey, whose blog read: \"If the government could pull-off a near-impossible technological miracle, does it not imply that the entire global computer industry is either totally incompetent or else it is a huge scam which produces stuff at very little cost and sells them at exorbitant prices.\"</p><p>Officials have been reluctant to talk about the project ahead of the launch, however, one did say that costs have been kept low by using students and researchers to do much of the designing.

The NGOs are implementing the work in the rural sub-county, while the Guardian reports on progress on its dedicated website and encourages donations from readers, which are being matchfunded by Barclays.</p><p>So would it? Possibly not at the Guardian – at least not in the same way – but  perhaps in a different form, elsewhere.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine\">Katine</a> project has thrown up various issues for the Guardian, crucially the  potential conflict involved in reporting on it. The project was part of the Guardian's Christmas appeal, so coverage had to encourage people to donate, but reporters had to write about its shortcomings – and that of development - honestly.</p><p>This potential conflict, and indeed the Katine project as a whole, points to the rapid change in coverage of humanitarian stories over the past few years as a result of new technology.</p><p>The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami revealed the potential of user-generated content (UGC) in quick-onset disasters – where for the first time key images came from the public rather than journalists. The mainstream media realised they did not necessarily need aid agencies as gatekeepers in such circumstances: the first-hand accounts, pictures and video were being supplied for free by ordinary people.</p><p>The aid agencies reacted by turning their press offices into pseudo-newsrooms and their press officers into reporters, generating their own films and stories, which they gave to the media. An example of this was a report from inside Burma during Cyclone Nargis that was filmed by the aid agency Merlin and led the BBC 10pm news programme on 18 May 2008.</p><p>Both approaches had problems. Despite the rise in mobile phone ownership in Africa, for example (one in three owns a mobile now compared to one in 50 in 2000), and the creation  of crowdsourcing sites such as <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a> that monitored post-election unrest in Kenya, UGC is still in its infancy. Verification is often difficult, hoaxing is an ever-present threat and for those hoping it would transform our understanding of development issues, the truth is UGC usually lends itself to the dramatic rather than the chronic, the earthquake over the famine.</p><p>Meanwhile, when aid agencies dabble in reporting themselves, as Dan Gillmor, the author of <a href=\"http://wethemedia.oreilly.com/\">We, The Media</a>, points out, they often end up producing \"almost journalism\"; they are, after all, not there to report, but to do an advocate's job, of which the mainstream media is still (rightly) suspicious.</p><p>In many ways, Katine sought to deal with both these problems: using the best of new media to illustrate people's lives, utilising both NGOs and the local community, while also keeping a sense of journalistic rigour.  Other NGOs have since adopted new technology to promote their work.</p><p>Using multimedia to focus on a particular village or  explain a topic opens the possibilities of telling more diverse stories and hearing more diverse voices using video, audio, visuals and interactive maps.</p><p>Save the Children UK says it started developing its <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/kroobay/\">Kroo Bay project</a> in Sierra Leone as far back as December 2006, before Katine started. Last year, the charity used a similar idea when it teamed up with the Sunday Times to launch its  <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/specials/sunday_times_appeal/\">Christmas appeal </a>for Kingsville, Liberia.<br /> <br />Other NGOs are using similar ideas for campaigning rather than overt fundraising. Late last year, the British Red Cross ventured into the world of alternative reality games (ARGs) with <a href=\"http://www.tracesofhope.com/\">Traces of Hope</a>,  written by the writer of Bebo's KateModern. Aimed at 15 to 18-year-olds in the UK, it attempted to engage players and introduce them to the consequences of the trauma of war, and how the Red Cross helps victims of conflict.</p><p>Meanwhile, Oxfam is considering how to best use new technology to campaign on climate change – its big focus for this year.  The organisation is looking to move from its interactive site <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/get_involved/campaign/climateorb/index.html\">Climate Orb</a> to focus on particular villages around the world and the subtle affects of climate change.</p><p>Lucy Brinicombe, of Oxfam, said the project was only at the planning stage and no final decision had been made, but that the organisation saw \"online communications as crucial to reaching people. We're not going to repeat Katine… but it's about explaining the human impact.\"</p><p>Rachel Palmer, of Save the Children, who helped set up both Kroo Bay and Kingsville, said that while numbers of those visiting the sites remained relatively small, those who did click on spent on average of four and a half minutes on both. The main aim of the sites, says Palmer, was not explaining development but to \"bear witness… to show people the similarity between their own children and an eight-year-old in Sierra Leone\".</p><p>What this demonstrates is that any successful descendants of Katine will be used not for objective journalism, but for appeals (as with Kingsville) or for campaigning (as with Traces of Hope). Trying to combine fundraising and campaigning with in-depth analyses of how successful projects are, as in the case of Katine, ends up with tension that cannot easily be resolved. Perhaps aid agencies should be left to \"do\" development, while the media  just continues to report on the work - good or bad.  </p><p>&#149; Glenda Cooper is a journalist and academic.

Now I have moved on and reached back 50,000 years thanks to the Genographic project, now in its fourth year, organised by National Geographic. The project is collecting data about us that not even Google can reach. A team from NG is scouring the Earth to collect more than 100,000 DNA samples to which are added many more from members of the public such as me. A few weeks ago I dispatched two samples of saliva, in phials from a kit NG provided, to a laboratory in Houston, Texas.</p><p>I was able to follow the progress of the analysis week by week on the web. The results, in the form of 10 pages of fascinating explanation and a map of my ancestors' long journey to Europe, have just appeared on my screen. My line has been traced back to 10,000 fellow members of Homo sapiens living in or about the Rift Valley in north Africa (roughly, modern Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania). It seems I am nothing special. About 70% of men in the south of England are fellow members of my \"haplogroup\", R1b, rising to more than 90% in parts of Spain and Ireland (95% in the north). A haplogroup is a series of \"markers\" shared by men carrying the same random mutations in their Y chromosome, only found in males. R1b is a kind of communal marker for men in the UK.</p><p>My journey, according to NG, began around 50,000 years ago, when melting ice in northern Europe prompted 10,000 or so of my ancestors - and probably yours - to travel northwards to warmer, moister climates. The first migrants from Africa took a coastal route that ended in Australia. Others later went from Siberia across what was then a land bridge to Alaska, to what is now Canada and the US. My lot, part of the second migration from Africa, followed grasslands and animals to the Middle East.</p><p>Another key ancestor born 40,000 years ago somewhere around modern Iran triggered a mutation marking a new lineage that spent the next 30,000 years populating much of the planet, with splinter groups moving into central Asia, Pakistan and India. NG points out that the descendants of my Iranian, or southern-central Asian ancestors, known as the Eurasian clan, include most people in the northern hemisphere, nearly all north Americans and east Asians and many Indians.</p><p>To cut a long story short, about 30,000 years ago our clan, by now numbering about 100,000 people, headed for Europe, marking the end of the 200,000-year era of the Neanderthals that had inhabited Europe and parts of western Asia previously. Some 20,000 years ago, expanding ice forced us to retreat to southern Spain, Italy and the Balkans before eventually moving back to the British Isles. The map of my genetic journey can be seen <a href=\"http://victorkeegan.com/iWeb/Victor%20Keegan%20shakespearesmonkey/iBlogs/iBlogs.html\">here</a> and I have to say that looking at a record of where you come from is a milestone moment. I did it thanks to a press kit from NG with its partner IBM, but anyone can participate <a href=\"https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/index.html\">online</a>. It costs &pound;68.94 plus delivery, with profits going to further scientific research. The project leader, Spencer Wells, told me that the internet was \"absolutely critical\" to the project, since it was the way people were recruited, the way they receive results and the way NG researchers operate around the world.</p><p>Sadly, the genetic traces of my ancestors' group ends between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago, though more details may be known as a result of extra information participants are invited to contribute about themselves. So there is still a gap between knowledge gained from genealogy and that from genetic searches. But that doesn't detract from the vital contribution the internet has made to resolving the most fascinating of problems - who we really are.</p><p>• This article was amended on 26 january 2009.

The intention is to change the entire system within a few years and raise a generation of Rwandans fluent in English.</p><p>Officially the move is intended to strengthen Rwanda's ties to its English-speaking east African neighbours, including Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, with which it does much of its trade. Kigali has also drawn closer to the US and Britain in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide. The UK is now the single largest donor to Rwanda, providing nearly half of its foreign aid, while Kigali has applied to join the Commonwealth though the country was never a British colony.</p><p>\"Really it is not choosing English for its own sake,\" said Claver Yisa, the director of policy planning at the education ministry. \"This is a way to make Rwanda to be equal, to use English. English is now a world language, especially in trade and commerce. Rwanda is trying to attract foreign investors — most of these people are speaking English.</p><p>\"It's choosing English as a medium of instruction so we Rwandans of today, and more importantly of tomorrow, will be able to benefit. If Spanish or any other language could get us to that, no problem. If Kinyarwanda could get us to that, that would be marvellous. It is not English for its own sake.\"</p><p>But there is little doubt that the decision to change the way a nation speaks has its roots in the still bitter legacy of Paris's role in the genocide of Rwanda's Tutsi population, which has seen the expulsion of the French ambassador and the closure of the French cultural centre, international school and radio station in Kigali.</p><p>At the heart of the dispute are attempts by each side to pin moral responsibility on the other for the murder of 800,000 Tutsis by extremist Hutus.</p><p>France's leading anti-terrorism judge, Jean-Louis Bruguière, has accused Rwanda's Tutsi president, Paul Kagame, and other leaders of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) that overthrew the genocidal regime, of prompting the slaughter by assassinating the Hutu president, Juvenal Habyarimana. A more widely accepted view is that Habyarimana was killed by Hutu extremists who then seized power.</p><p>Rwanda for its part has accused more than 30 French politicians, officials and military officers of supporting the genocidal regime, including the late president, François Mitterrand.</p><p>English was made an official language in Rwanda, alongside French and Kinyarwanda, after the RPF took power in 1994, because many of the RPF's leaders are Tutsis who grew up in exile in English-speaking Uganda and Tanzania. Among them is Rwanda's education minister, Daphrosa Gahakwa, who took O levels in Uganda and studied at the University of East Anglia in England.</p><p>But the switch to English dominance is a huge undertaking in a country where more than 95% of schools teach in French to pupils from about the age of nine.</p><p>\"The problem we are expecting is not with the children,\" said Yisa. \"The children can always learn. The problem is the teachers, but we have already started training some teachers with English.\"</p><p>Rwanda has 31,000 primary school teachers of whom about 4,700 have been trained in English. Of the 12,000 secondary school teachers — only about half of all Rwandan children move beyond primary education — just 600 have been taught the language they will soon be expected to teach in.</p><p>\"That's not a big number but we are now working on an accelerated programme to train teachers in a mass. Where do we find the people to train them? We are looking around in neighbouring countries, even beyond. We have the British Council ready to come in. Having all the world speaking English, I think it is not difficult to get people to come and teach us,\" said Yisa.</p><p>Schools will become bilingual and will teach some subjects in English and others in French as capacity is built up. \"We are starting with those subjects which are really not that difficult in terms of language — mathematics, sciences. We will wait for history or arts subjects that need a lot of language for explanation and description,\" said Yisa.</p><p>\"The intention is to do it as fast as possible. In the first year it will be a bit of a problem but as people get trained, as teachers graduate from the college of education having started in English, and they go to school conversant in English, things will be moving faster.\"</p><p>Instruction at Kigali's elite Institute of Science and Technology is already in English and it is increasingly the language of the national university.</p><p>Yisa, who grew up in Tanzania, denies there is any political element to the subordination of French. He also denies that the move will leave franco-phone Hutus at a disadvantage to anglophone Tutsis.</p><p>\"We have a common language: Kinyarwanda. This is really a rare benefit.

There's been endless debate on the wisdom of this. Detractors say that the developing world needs food, literacy training and mobile phones – not laptops. These sceptics are sure to see the OLPC's woes as confirmation that the project was doomed from the start.</p><p>But I disagree, on both counts. I believe that the world's poor will derive lasting, meaningful benefit from widespread access to technology and networks. And I believe that laptop computers will eventually find their way into the hands of practically every child in the developing world, even if the OLPC project shuts its doors tomorrow.</p><p>First, the case for laptops as tools for sustainable, appropriate, community-driven development: the original, audacious OLPC plan envisioned its laptops as pedagogical and development wonder-boxes. They were to be wide open and trivially modifiable by their owners, ensuring that inspired young programmers could develop any and all software and hardware add-ons that suited their needs. Their networking stacks were built on the idea of forming ad-hoc meshes that made it easy to connect any OLPC units to one another, and to share Internet connections among them.</p><p>In short, the OLPC vision is to deliver to children in the developing world the capacity to play and work together to produce tools and networks and communities at the lowest possible cost, with the highest possible flexibility. Poverty and its associated problems – hunger, poor health, lack of education and disenfranchisement – are fundamentally information problems. Poverty is exacerbated by the high cost of discovering how your peers have solved their agricultural problems, of accessing government services, of communicating with distant relations who have gone to the city to earn on behalf of the family. Poverty and oppression thrive in situations where people can't communicate cheaply and widely with one another about corruption, injustice and violence.</p><p>The success of mobile phones in defraying these co-ordination costs shows just how profoundly technology can change the cycle of poverty. Whether it's electoral monitors armed with mobile phones who watch the ballots move from the polls to the counting houses in Kenya, the citizen reporters who exposed the brutality in Myanmar, or the fishermen and farmers in Africa and Asia who use networks to find the best market for their goods. A mobile phone network can multiply the food, education, health and democracy that  is already there, and be used to bring new resources besides.</p><p>But mobile phones are necessarily an interim step. Adding software to most mobile phones is difficult or impossible without the permission of a central carrier, which makes life very hard for local technologists who have a very particular, local itch that needs scratching (and forget about collectively improving the solutions that do get approved – when was the last time you heard of someone downloading an app for her phone, improving it, and republishing it?). Mobile phone use is always metered, limiting their use and exacting a toll on people who can least afford to pay it. Worst of all, the centralised nature of mobile networks means that in times of extremis, governments and natural disasters will wreak havoc on our systems, just as we need them most.</p><p>By contrast, an open laptop with mesh networking is designed to be locally customised, to have its lessons broadcast to others who can use them, and to avoid centralised control and vulnerability to bad weather and bad governments. It is designed to be nearly free from operating costs, so that once the initial investment is made, all subsequent use is free, encouraging experimentation and play, from which all manner of innovations may spring.</p><p>It may be that OLPC won't be the entity that puts a laptop into the hands of every child on the planet. Certainly, they've disappointed me more than once along the way: for example, the decision to add remote kill-switches to the machines to deter thieves (incidentally creating a situation where a thuggish state or despot could shut down the network), and the decision to emphasise running Microsoft's proprietary, non-customisable, toll-bearing operating systems at the expense of the free, locally modifiable GNU/Linux systems they started with.</p><p>But so what? I remember the decades during which I (and others of my bent) went around telling people that PCs and the internet were destined to change their lives for ever, no matter who they were, no matter what they did. Over those years, we had many failures, mostly due to bad preconceptions of why and how our loved ones and co-workers would benefit from our beloved systems. We told our grandmothers that the PC would be the ultimate cookbook, told our bosses that the internet would let them field better sales brochures, told our kids that educational CD-Roms would teach them to read faster. From Sinclair to Commodore to Acorn, computing platforms rose and fell, breaking up on the cliffs of the unguessable public taste.</p><p>Slowly and surely, though, IT infiltrated every social group. Whether you're looking for an underground dance party on Friday or help coping with your terminal cancer or a way to feed your compulsive need to acquire plush stuffed animals, the internet is where you live. Each new group came online when one key person within it figured out what all this technology was for, as far as his social circle was concerned. My grandparents steadfastly ignored PCs until they worked out that all their friends were getting scads of email from their grandchildren, while they were stuck with a few paltry letters and cards. In record time, a PC and internet connection were purchased, installed, and mastered – at least, far enough to tackle the key task for which the machine was purchased.</p><p>The protean nature of IT is its greatest weakness – it's impossible to say what it's for – and its greatest strength – it's for anything you can think of. The OLPC detractors who say that the rich, northern minority can't know what the world's majority need are right. And that's why giving the world's poor access to the tools that they can use in any way they can imagine is so powerful. It's a break from the centuries-old model of development and aid. It's an invitation for the world's majority to simultaneously access all of human knowledge as equal participants in the global conversation, all the while having the power to modify their systems to match their needs.</p><p>Early PCs such as the 1975 Altair were unrelentingly hostile to their users<br />and functionally useless except as systems for occupying the spare time of their owners. And yet, these early efforts led inexorably to the continuous refinement of technology, as larger and larger populations of users were captured by the promise of these systems. The eventual failure of the Altair (discontinued in 1978) did not invalidate the promise of computing. It would have been a visionary entrepreneur indeed who invented the perfect system the first time out.</p><p>Likewise, the OLPC may falter and vanish. But the vision of a world where we can all talk to one another, where we can all modify our tools to suit our needs, where we are not charged a toll for our access to democracy, communities and ideas – that will live on forever.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2009/1/13/1231843390436/OLPC-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jan/13/one-laptop-per-child-cory-doctorow","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/jan/13/one-laptop-per-child-cory-doctorow","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Meet the bright young stars of travel","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-04T00:01:00Z","sectionId":"travel","id":"travel/2009/jan/04/young-stars-travel-future-innovation","fields":{"body":"<h2>Alex Calderwood</h2><p><strong>Founder: Ace Hotels</strong><br /><strong>Age: 38 </strong><br /><strong>Shaking up the hotel trade by blending luxury and budget</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-341369422'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2009/01/05/AlexPR.jpg' alt='Alex Calderwood, founder of Ace Hotels' width='220' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Calderwood is a leading creative force behind the Ace hotel group, one of the the most innovative in North America.

So it's all the more impressive that Austick, one of the most innovative guides working in Europe today, grew up in Newcastle and started out working for his dad's electrical engineering firm. \"After a while it was a case of 'Son, you ain't going to fit in here',\" he says. \"I spent every possible spare minute skiing, so pretty soon I decided I had to make it my career.\" </p><p>After parting company with his dad, aged 19, Austick moved to St Anton, Austria, and by 2000 had become the first Briton to have both the top British skiing-instruction qualification and the highest-level mountain guiding certificate. The same year, he set up Piste to Powder, a ski school specifically catering to the growing number of people who wanted to ski off-piste. Rather than hiring a private guide for at least &pound;250 a day, it meant individuals could turn up, pay a flat fee (this winter &pound;71) and join a group of a similar standard. A simple idea, but traditional Alpine ski schools have always been slow to innovate, and copycat operations are only now starting to pop up in the Alps. </p><p>But Austick didn't stop there. Recognising that more and more skiers were looking for adventures away from crowded resorts, he started running trips to ever more remote slopes - from Greenland to Alaska, Russia, the Himalayas and South America. Austick pushed into the least visited areas, until clients were skiing down mountains that had never been climbed, let alone skied before. In Alaska, the group travelled into the wilderness on a ski-equipped light aircraft then set up camp, in Greenland they arrived by dogsled. </p><p>Now Austick has a new focus - the Lyngen Alps in arctic Norway. \"When I first went I'd never seen anywhere like it for skiing - super mountains, great snow, and your final turns finish on the beach where the waves are breaking.\" He started ski trips in the area based on a chartered sail boat, but has now built his own wilderness lodge, from which skiers are ferried by speed boat to different mountains each day. \"For your average alpine skier, the concept of skiing untracked powder, and ending up on the beach, is just bananas really.\" </p><p>• <strong>Top tip: </strong>\"Ski touring [using sticky skins attached to skis to climb uphill, rather than ski lifts] is coming into its own. Heliskiing is fun, but there's a level of stress that you don't get with ski touring.

They had both worked overseas on eco-projects in the developing world, but felt that no one was offering that type of holiday back in Scotland. The idea was to combine their experience of working in ecology, with their expert knowledge of the local area.\"</p><p>Alongside traditional hiking and mountain-biking holidays, Wilderness Scotland offers more unusual trips - kayaking, photography and family exploratory holidays - and has expanded its brand of eco-friendly holidays overseas. \"We set up a sister company about three years ago, Wilderness Journeys, which runs trips to remoter parts of Kenya, South America and Bhutan.

We decided on a yurt and in 2007, we took just one yurt around the country, offering treatments,\" says Dawes. </p><p>While at the festivals, they realised that although there were companies offering \"comfortable accommodation\", a gap in the market remained. </p><p>\"There was nothing particularly luxurious, and we felt yurts could offer that, so we went back to the guy in Devon where we had bought our first one and ordered 12 more. We then set up a mobile hotel: each yurt has a kingsized bed and fresh flowers, and we still offer the spa treatments. At some festivals we offer a B&amp;B service - fresh croissants and coffee.\" </p><p>Yurtel's clients tend to be older people who might not go to festivals if it meant toughing it out under canvas, and they intend to up the luxury factor. </p><p>\"We're looking to add five more yurts and also a shower and toilet trailer.\" But Dawe admits that their long-term goal is a touch more glamorous: \"Our ultimate dream is a health retreat somewhere overseas.

Now our planet's few remaining undeveloped expanses are accessible only to well-funded expeditions protected by mobile phones and helicopters - enterprises unattractive to the temperamental descendents of Mungo Park, Mary Kingsley et al. Happily, it's still possible for such individuals to embark on solo journeys through little-known regions where they can imagine how real explorers used to feel. </p><p>Reviewers tend to describe my most exhilarating journeys as \"adventures\", though to me they are a form of escapism - a concept unfairly tainted with negative connotations. If journeys are designed as alternatives to one's everyday routine, why shouldn't they be escapist? Why not move in time as well as space, and live for a few weeks or months at the slow pace enjoyed by our ancestors? In recent decades everything has become quicker and easier: transport, communications, heating, cooking, cleaning, dressing, shopping, entertaining. \"S&amp;T\" have reduced physical effort to the minimum - but are we genetically equipped to cope with our effortless new world?

Dervla Murphy</figcaption></figure><p>There is, of course, a certain irony here: technology has rendered the traditional simple journey somewhat artificial. Previously, those who roamed far and wide had to be isolated for long periods; now isolation is a deliberately chosen luxury. Had I died of a burst appendix in the Hindu Kush or the Simiens or the Andes, it would have been my own fault (no two-way radio) rather than a sad misfortune. Therefore, in one sense, escapist travelling has become a game - but only in one sense. The actual journey is for real: whatever happens, you can't chicken out. You're alone where you've chosen to be, and must take the consequences. (I prefer to forget that nowadays one is never quite alone. With all those satellites, the solitary traveller may be observed picking her nose in the middle of the Great Karoo.)</p><p>To facilitate escapism, I offer the following tips ...</p><p><strong>1. Choose your country, use guidebooks to identify the areas most frequented by foreigners - and then go in the opposite direction.</strong></p><p>This advice reeks of political incorrectness; it's \"snobbish\" to draw a clear distinction between travellers and tourists. Yet it's also realistic. The escapist traveller needs space, solitude, silence. Tragically, during my lifetime, roads have drastically depleted that natural habitat. Adverts for phoney \"adventure tours\" make me grind my few remaining teeth. For example, \"England to Kenya by truck! Overland adventure! See five countries in six weeks!\" Who in their right mind wants to see five countries in six weeks? How not to escape . . . I always try to get off the beaten track. One favourite place where I did so was a trek from Asmara to Addis Ababa. Things are different now, but most people I encountered then had never seen a white person before. Even on more recent trips in Russia and Romania - where I took fairly obvious routes that certainly weren't unchartered land - I always stayed away from the tourist trails.</p><p><strong>2. Mug up on history.</strong></p><p>To travel in ignorance of a region's history leaves you unable to understand the \"why\" of anything or anyone. For instance, Castro's Cuba (the subject of my latest book) must baffle visitors uninformed about the 500-year lead-up to Fidel's revolution. But heavy sociological or political research is unnecessary - although if you happen to fancy that sort of thing it will add an extra dimension to your journey. Otherwise, enough of current politics will be revealed as you go along, and in those happy lands where domestic politics don't matter to the locals you can forget about them.  </p><p>Learn as much as possible about religious and social taboos, and then scrupulously respect them. Where gifts of money are inappropriate, find out what substitutes to carry. In Muslim countries, such as Afghanistan, a code of conduct towards travellers prevents acceptance of money from guests, so I often buy gifts for the children from the local bazaars.</p><p><strong>3. Travel alone, or with just one prepubescent child.</strong></p><p>In some countries even two adults may be perceived as providing mutual support, making acceptability by the locals less spontaneous and complete. Au contraire, a child's presence emphasises your trust in the community's goodwill. And because children pay little attention to racial or cultural differences, junior companions rapidly demolish barriers of shyness or apprehension often raised when foreigners unexpectedly approach a remote village. I found this to be the case in all my travels with my young daughter, especially when we travelled through Kodagu in southern India. </p><p><strong>4. Don't overplan.</strong></p><p>At sunrise it's not necessary - nor even desirable - to know where you are going to be at sunset. In sparsely inhabited areas carry a lightweight tent and sleeping bag. Elsewhere, rely on fate to provide shelter: dependence on those met en route greatly enhances escapism, and villagers are unfailingly hospitable to those who trust them. I have been welcomed into villagers' homes everywhere I've cycled or walked, and was always grateful for what was typically a space on the floor. \"Trust\" is a key word for relaxed travelling among people whose different way of life may demand adaptability but should prompt no unease or suspicion.</p><p><strong>5. Be self-propelling: walk or cycle. </strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-341279286'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2009/01/02/dervla2.jpg' alt='Dervla Murphy' width='130' height='220' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Dervla's trusty steed</figcaption></figure><p>For long treks, far from roads and towns, buy a pack animal to carry food, camping gear, kerosene for your stove if firewood is scarce - and of course your child, should he or she be too small to walk all day. </p><p>When organising such a trek, allow for spending a week or 10 days at your starting point, enquiring about the best source of pack animals. Take care to find a reliable advisor as well as a horse trader - preferably someone unconnected to the trader. In Ethiopia, in 1966, I was lucky enough to be advised by Princess Aida, granddaughter of the then-emperor, Haile Selassie, and half a dozen mules were paraded around the courtyard of a royal palace for my inspection. A decade or so later, in Baltistan, I bought a retired polo pony to carry Rachel, my six-year-old daughter, and our camping gear and supplies, including two sacks of flour because in mid-winter in the Karakorum, the villagers have no spare food. In Peru, as a nine-year-old, Rachel rode a mule named Juana for the first 600 miles from Cajamarca, but a fodder shortage necessitated her walking the remaining 900 miles to Cuzco: poor Juana had become so debilitated that she could carry only our gear. </p><p>It's important to travel light. At least 75% of the equipment sold nowadays in camping shops - travel clotheslines, rolled-up camping mats, lightweight hairdryers - is superfluous. My primary basics, although it depends on the journey, are a lightweight tent, a sleeping bag suitable for the country's temperature, and a stove.</p><p><strong>6. If assisted by a pack animal, take detailed local advice about the terrain ahead.</strong></p><p>And remember, campsites suitable for you may be disaster areas for a hungry horse or mule. Then you must press on, often to a site hardly fit for humans, but providing adequate grazing. We can do the mind-over-matter bit, while resolving never again to let supplies run so low, but an equine helper doesn't have that sort of mind. If there's no fodder at 6.30pm, the mule cannot have consoling thoughts about stuffing it in at 6.30pm the next day. And there is nothing more guilt-provoking than seeing a pack animal who has worked hard for you all day denied sustenance. </p><p><strong>7. Cyberspace intercourse vitiates genuine escapism.</strong></p><p>Abandon your mobile phone, laptop, i-Pod and all such links to family, friends and work colleagues. Concentrate on where you are, deriving your entertainment from immediate stimuli, the tangible world around you. Increasingly, in hostels and guesthouses, one sees \"independent\" travellers eagerly settling down in front of computers instead of conversing with fellow travellers. They seem only partially \"abroad\", unable to cut their links with home. Evidently the nanny state - and the concomitant trend among parents to over-protect offspring - has alarmingly diminished the younger generation's self-reliance. And who is to blame for this entrapment in cyberspace? Who but the fussy folk back at base, awaiting the daily (even twice daily) email of reassurance. </p><p><strong>8. Don't be inhibited by the language barrier.</strong></p><p>Although it thwarts exchanges of ideas, it's unimportant on a practical level. I've wandered around four continents using only English and a few courtesy phrases of Tibetan, Amharic, Quechua, Albanian or whatever. Our basic needs - sleeping, eating, drinking - can always be indicated by signs or globally understood noises.  </p><p>Even on the emotional level, the language barrier is quite porous. People's features - particularly their eyes - are wonderfully eloquent. In our everyday lives, the extent to which we wordlessly communicate is taken for granted. In \"far-flungery\", where nobody within 100 miles speaks a word of any European language, one fully appreciates the range of moods and subtle feelings that may be conveyed visually rather than aurally. </p><p><strong>9. Be cautious - cautious as distinct from timid.</strong></p><p>The assumption that only brave or reckless people undertake solo journeys off the beaten track is without foundation. In fact, escapists are ultra cautious: that's one of their hallmarks, and an essential component of their survival mechanisms. Before departure, they suss out likely dangers and either change their route - should these seem excessive - or prepare to deal with any reasonable hazards. </p><p>Granted, there's a temperamental issue here: is a bottle half-empty or half-full? Why should your bones break abroad rather than at home? Optimists don't believe in disasters until they happen and therefore are not fearful - which is the opposite of being brave.</p><p><strong>10. Invest in the best-available maps. </strong></p><p>And whatever you do, don't forget your compass.</p><p>• The Island That Dared: Journeys in Cuba, by Dervla Murphy (Eland, &pound;16.99)</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2009/01/02/peru1.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jan/03/dervla-murphy-travel-tips","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2009/jan/03/dervla-murphy-travel-tips","sectionName":"Travel"},{"webTitle":"What not to miss in 2009: world and folk music events","webPublicationDate":"2008-12-30T00:50:42Z","sectionId":"music","id":"music/2008/dec/30/best-world-folk-music-2009","fields":{"body":"<h2>Richard Thompson: 1000 Years of Popular Music</h2><p>He may be a remarkable guitarist and one of Britain's finest and bleakest songwriters, but Richard Thompson also has a quirky sense of humour.

He said: \"Using GM technology, there are now varieties of major crops, rice, wheat and maize being produced that are drought resistant, flood resistant, saline resistant and disease resistant, which could transform Africa's ability to feed its people ... Some products have emerged, for example, from South Africa. They are now planting drought resistant crops that have increased the yield by 30% ... So you can actually save millions of people from starvation by these techniques – nothing to do with the private sector ... Americans are perfectly happy to eat [unlabelled GM food] and I don't know of anyone who has ever suffered from eating a GM product.\"  </p><p>There is nothing wrong with this – similar claims are made all the time by people working for GM companies. Except that this was not <a href=\"http://www.monsanto.co.uk/\">Monsanto</a>'s press officer, it was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/nov/27/gmcrops.food\">Professor Sir David King</a>, recently retired as the UK government's chief scientist.</p><p>The first claim, if read carefully, is not inaccurate. GM companies are trying to produce crops that are drought, flood and saline resistant, and although none are available for commercial use, in theory such crops could increase food production in Africa and elsewhere – if you make a number of assumptions.</p><p>These assumptions are not scientific, they are political, subjective and highly contested. This particular point of view assumes that the key cause of hunger and starvation is lack of food, rather than problems with distribution, access to land, wars, corruption and poverty. It also assumes that in future poor farmers will have no problems with buying expensive seeds, fertiliser and pesticides, all of which are required by GM crops. I know many people assume GM crops must somehow be needed to feed the world. But the <a href=\"http://www.agassessment.org/\">IAASTD</a> (the food and farming equivalent to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report by 400 international scientists – led by Professor Robert Watson, now chief scientist at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – said GM crops were not essential to feed the world.</p><p>David King was wrong to say that drought-resistant GM products that increase yield by 30% are now being planted in South Africa. In fact, Monsanto is carrying out trials of GM drought-resistant maize in South Africa. The process of trialling the crops has only just begun (a permit was issued a year ago), and these crops are probably about eight years away from commercial use if they prove to be successful. No drought-resistant GM crops are currently grown commercially in South Africa. King has been wrong before about new crops in Africa, claiming that a successful project near Lake Victoria was benefiting from GM technology, before having to admit the crops involved were not GM at all.</p><p>In the BBC programme, David King referred to crops like rice that are \"flood resistant\". In fact the submergence tolerant (flood resistant) rice that is on the market is not GM, but instead marker assisted selection (MAS), normal breeding informed by knowledge of the genome and supported by environmentalists and organic organisations, was used to develop it. This is an example of the kind innovative non-GM plant breeding that is making a lot of progress in a number of areas that the GM companies are only just beginning to tackle – with unknown results. Marker-assisted breeding (usually called marker assisted selection) uses the genetic diversity found in crops or their wild relatives, combined with genomic data (genomic markers) to speed up what are otherwise essentially conventional breeding methods.<br /> <br />Two years ago, the scientists at the University of California Davis responsible for developing submergence tolerant rice initially tried to develop the rice using both MAS and GM techniques. While the MAS worked well and quickly, GM failed initially, for unknown reasons. The scientists were moving a rice gene into another type of rice, so this failure simply underlines the inherent uncertainty and lack of precision in GM technology. Finally, a couple months ago, the scientists did get the GM process to work, but this version is not being bred for sale to farmers. To get the GM process to work, the scientists had to attach the gene they wanted to transfer to a very powerful promoter – the part of the gene that determines in what parts of the plant, when, and how much, the gene functions (called \"expression\"). The promoter they used is from an ubiquitin gene and it is turned on at a high level in many tissues of the plant, most of the time.  </p><p>This contrasts with the normal (native) promoter of the sub1A gene, which is turned on only when needed in the plants and at the correct levels. Therefore, while the sub1A gene, run by the ubi promoter may nominally function, it is much more likely to have negative side effects in the plant because of its incorrect expression (called ectopic expression). These effects could be harmful to health or the environment, or just have adverse effects on the agronomic properties of the crop (for example, it could cause the crop to grow poorly under some conditions, as has happened in practice with some other GM crops). Normal breeding using MAS worked better and faster, and is less likely to have negative side effects.</p><p>David King also mentioned GM crops that \"have not been produced in the private sector, they've all been produced by government and international research laboratories\" when he spoke about crops being developed for farming in South Africa. I assume that he was actually talking about the Water Efficient Maize for Africa project (WEMA), which involves several African countries – Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and South Africa. The WEMA project was only announced in 2008, so no crops have yet been grown even experimentally. The projections for yield increases from this project are that \"the maize products developed over the next 10 years could increase yields by 20-35% under moderate drought, compared to current varieties\".  But this applies to non-GM as well as possible GM varieties, and the first conventional varieties developed by WEMA could be available after six to seven years of research and development. The project <a href=\"http://www.monsanto.com/droughttolerantcorn/WEMA.asp\">says</a> that GM drought-tolerant maize hybrids \"will be available in about ten years\". </p><p>David King was also wrong to say that Americans are happy consuming GM food: in fact, there is no labelling in the US and many Americans don't even know they are eating GM. When limited labelling was introduced on alternatives to Monsanto's GM-hormone milk, sales of the GM product collapsed and Monsanto sold the business.  </p><p>Finally, of course, no one has carried out any scientific experiments to see whether eating GM crops in America has caused any \"suffering\". There is no evidence to say that they have caused suffering, just as there's no evidence to show that they have not. We simply do not know. There have only been a small handful of studies looking at the long-term safety of eating GM food, using properly conducted animal trials, some covering possible inter-generational effects. </p><p>All of these show some grounds for concern. Most recently, a study funded by the Austrian government and carried out by two of the leading research institutes in Austria, found that Monsanto's GM maize \"severely impairs reproduction in mice\" and the scientists involved said that there is an \"urgent need for further studies\". These safety doubts confirm earlier research findings, and they have in turn been confirmed by other recently published research. In the light of the published science, it is now impossible to say that GM is safe to eat.</p><p>David King's pro-GM views have been clear for many years, equally, he has been in the forefront of the battle to get the science about climate change accepted and acted on. On climate change, he supports international scientific opinion (the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\">IPCC</a>), and the honourable role he and other scientists play is to disseminate the science that explains what climate change is, why it is happening, and what cuts in greenhouse gases are needed to avoid the worst impacts. Scientists should talk to the public about their work, and scientists working for the government should be open about the scientific advice they give, and the basis for it.  </p><p>But King has entered into the political realm, making assumptions about how societies will be organised in future, which current trends will continue and which will change, and which type of development (for example, largely controlled by multi-national companies and international institutions) we will pursue. He is just as entitled as anyone else to have personal views on these issues. So why do his pronouncements anger many people, including me? The answer was provided by a member of the public who King talked to on the BBC programme. After listening to the ex-chief scientist's views, they said, \"Naturally a personal chat with somebody is very reassuring – somebody who knows the facts, which of course I don't. I'm relying on you.\"</p><p>It seems to me that King is expressing personal and political views under the assumption that they are science. In trying to expand the sales of GM crops, he reminds me of the men in white coats who sold toothpaste in TV ads when I was a child. I think this is why people do not trust scientists working for governments much more than they trust scientists working for corporations.  It is not, as these scientists always claim, because people do not trust or understand science – surveys show that people trust scientists working for non-governmental organisations far more than government or industry scientists. People are sceptical about scientists who pronounce not on science but on politics and products such as GM crops – and particularly about those who fail to make clear the personal or organisational views that colour the assumptions they make. Sadly, King shows that we are right to be sceptical.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/09/david-king-gm-crops","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/09/david-king-gm-crops","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"@ Social Innovation Camp: The final presentations, and the winners...","webPublicationDate":"2008-12-07T18:27:15Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/pda/2008/dec/07/socialinnovationcamp-events","fields":{"body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.sicamp.org/\"><img src=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/digitalcontent/sic3oct2008.jpg\" width=\"162\" height=\"162\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right\" alt=\"sic3oct2008.jpg\" /></a>It's crunch time at <strong>Social Innovation Camp</strong>, where the seven teams are about to present their projects so far.

Users enter their name, address and a password, and when they enter they state which company has been spamming them. The site does the rest, sending a polite letter to the firm asking them to remove your details. It sends a follow up asking for confirmation the company to confirm it has complied: \"Would you confirm that I have been removed from your mail list, which is a legal obligation?\"</p><p>It also suggested alternative ways users could get information from that firm (a gesture to keep the companies sweeter, perhaps?) like their company blog, <strong>Facebook</strong> group, podcasts and <strong>Twitter</strong> feeds. Using <strong><a href=\"http://www.amee.cc\">Amee's</a></strong> carbon information, the site works out how much carbon has been saved according to the mail you were being sent, and how often it was being posted to you.

The <a href=\"http://github.org/metade/weneed\">technical teams</a> had thought about the <a href=\"http://metade.org/code/weneed\">interface</a>, and how a visual menu would be easier for this user group. Eventually the results could be plotted on a national map that will give a localised picture of regional need across the country.</p><p>Project leader <strong>Craig Griffin</strong> is convinced that this is a powerful and long-overdue initiative and he's hungry for money to take it further. A senior executive in a care fir told him that \"if you can create a smart interface with a set of rules that maps the requirements into an indicative budget allocation, I have half a dozen authorities who will have your hand off.\" What next? Griffin: \"This is what we have done in just one weekend with people we've never met before. We need funding to take this to the next stage of a business road map, and we need data artists, web interface specialists.\"</p><p><strong>Useful Visitors</strong></p><p>How many of us went abroad this year and had some spare time? Trying to ingratiate themselves with the judges, the Useful Visitors team suggested it would be great to integrate the service with <strong>Dopplr</strong>. The site is fairly well advanced (at least they actually have one) - a rough prototype that took about 18 hours. The next version should be able to use the APIs from <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and <strong>Dopplr</strong>, mobile entry, multiple languages and an automatic update to users after their trip to gather feedback. They want the project to be underwritten by corporations and have private-label versions for big organisations, and they would focus on <strong>Nigeria</strong>, <strong>South Africa</strong> and <strong>Kenya</strong> for launch.</p><p>The challenges? Getting to a critical mass of volunteers, quality control and security, and scaling up to new countries. Rather like the sofa surfing network, this seems like a great idea but there are complex logistical and practical problems in settings this up. It's a fabulous idea but, like many of the SICamp ideas, I wonder if it isn't just a bit too big to try and tackle here? Matt Biddulph of Dopplr asked: \"How do you keep people in that virtuous cycle of using the site and recommending it?\" The team said they envision developing a set of APIs so this could be incorporated into existing services.</p><p><strong>Good Gym</strong></p><p>\"My Name's Iva, and I don't really like gyms.\" This is a lovely and simple idea; athletes run useful errands instead of pounding a useless treadmill in the gym, and 'coaches' get the benefit of human interaction and a newspaper, or fruit or their <strong>National Lottery</strong> numbers done. Feedback from runners and public on the street was very positive; most would want to do it if it was nearby and felt it would give them motivation to exercise.</p><p>The web interface is simple; athletes say how far they want to run, where they live and what kind of errands they can fulfill. A map shows where the coaches are and using pictures pulled from <strong>Flickr</strong> based on tags they show the needs of each person - what they need help with, what time of day and their interests. Great presentation, simple idea. GPs, daycare centres and social services would all link into the service, and after a period of testing the concept it would cost £1.79 for each errand.</p><p><strong>OwnGrown</strong></p><p>The project formerly known as <strong>Vegsy</strong> now describes itself an \"an online community for people who want to eat and grow ultra local, real food\". It's another alternative to the ethical black hole of supermarkets and the worthy but overpriced farmers' markets. The case: Half the vegetables and 95% of fruit eaten in the UK comes from overseas. There's a ten-year waiting list for some allotments. Sales of edible plants and seeds is up 70%. £1.7bn of fruit and vegetables i thrown away each year. One million people grow produce at home - and how much surplus do they have? That's the Owngrown market.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-340459013'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/12/7/1228676192759/veg7dec2008.jpg' alt='Owngrown's first delivery...' width='460' height='303' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Owngrown's first delivery...</figcaption></figure><p>Congratulations on this team for actually building something; <a href=\"http://owngrown.sicamp.org\">the site</a> lets growers list their produce and matches them with people who want to buy it.

The first incarnation of the site is quite charming, but I have some doubts that this is the best way to sell vegetables - even if you can reserve 2lbs of Mrs Miggins' carrots two weeks before they are harvested.

To many people, though, it is something even more important: a turning-point that will either prove that government doesn't always have to bow to a corporate version of the inevitable, or sorely test thousands of people's limited faith in politics. Bizarrely, the frontline is the nondescript Middlesex village of Sipson, a clump of postwar suburban housing that was famously visited last year by the Camp For Climate Action. A ruling in favour of a third runway at Heathrow airport will mean that Sipson will be concreted over. If - by some 11th-hour miracle - it survives, it will be transformed from a very noisy corner of west London into a byword for against-the-odds optimism.</p><p>The final decision was yesterday postponed until the new year. Though the Tories' recent manoeuvrings have suggested a bonfire of David Cameron's early progressive poses, his party is opposed. Since 2003, by contrast, the government line has been fervent support for the plan, with limp caveats on noise and pollution - though, according to a steady trickle of stories, a loose group of cabinet ministers have been expressing a mixture of unease and outright opposition, from the energised new climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, through his brother David, on to Harriet Harman, Hilary Benn and John Denham. Ranged against them, unfortunately, is a truly titanic alliance: among other ministers, the PM and the transport secretary Geoff Hoon, along with BAA, the airlines, the CBI, at least two of the big unions, and the relevant parts of the civil service.</p><p>Lower down the Labour food chain, plenty of MPs are terrified of the damage a pro-expansion decision will do to the party's atrophying vote in the home counties. Others cleave to that residual old Labour position whereby the promise of jobs - British jobs, to use the vernacular - trumps just about everything. </p><p>Some people claim that, despite predictions of serial loopholes, the inclusion of aviation in EU emissions trading from 2012 might somehow lessen a third runway's environmental impact. Maybe, they argue, the air industry can be treated with kid gloves as long as there is huge movement on low-carbon electricity generation and car technology. But much clearer arguments surely point in the opposite direction. What with the Climate Change Committee chaired by Adair Turner urging as much as a 42% cut in Britain's greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and the younger Miliband pledged to an 80% drop by 2050, how is the case for expansion credible?</p><p>A third runway will increase the number of Heathrow flights by almost a half. Every year, its CO2 emissions will equal those of Kenya. It would be completed just as the effects of climate change start to blitz the developing world, which will couch the story in a horrible poetry: Europeans blithely securing even easier global travel, while millions cope with food shortages, water scarcity, and a rather more nightmarish kind of population movement.</p><p>Though only a fool would be optimistic, some rumblings from Westminster and Whitehall suggest that the delayed decision might denote at least a tiny shred of hope, and a belated realisation of how massively symbolic this story is. As with a proposed revival of coal-fired electricity, the third runway represents something truly era-defining: it may not have the iconic ring of your Caracases or Porto Alegres, but if we're going to have an even halfway progressive future, Sipson would be a great place to start.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/05/comment-runway-heathrow-sipson-third","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/05/comment-runway-heathrow-sipson-third","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"TV soap 'way in'  to difficult topics","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-18T00:01:00Z","sectionId":"education","id":"worldwise/tv-soap","fields":{"body":"<p>Red has a problem. She is in love with PP but her mum has forbidden her to see him and wants her daughter to concentrate on exams.</p><p>It's a classic love dilemma that every UK teenager would recognise. But this plotline is taken from Makutano Junction, the east African soap opera now in its fourth series. The show was originally funded by the Department for International Development (DfID) to convey serious issues through an entertaining medium.</p><p>\"TV ownership has risen significantly in Kenya with 50% of TV owners living in rural areas. So the soap was a way of reaching these isolated audiences,\" says Kate Lloyd Morgan, from Mediae, the soap's production company.</p><p>It is set in the fictional village of Makutano and follows the lives and loves of a dynamic cast. All the usual ingredients are there - romance, tragedy and corruption, set alongside critical issues such as malaria and HIV.</p><p>The show had been running for two years when Mediae decided it could have wider use. \"We spotted a gap for a resource that would teach British students about global issues through an attractive medium,\" Lloyd Morgan says.</p><p>With DfID funding, a pilot started in September 2007 with development education centres in the south-west. The pilot involved 20 schools and a number of activities were developed.</p><p>\"Schools varied hugely in how they used the material,\" says Lloyd Morgan. \"We provided episodes on DVD along with activities on certain issues. Some schools just wanted the episodes while others used our activities.\"</p><p>The pilot finished in July 2008 and is now rolling out nationally. A website has been launched that features downloadable activities and all episodes from the four series.</p><p>Feedback from the pilot episodes suggests that Makutano Junction has been a hit with both students and teachers. Lynn Cutler, from Somerset's development education centre, says the soap has helped them promote global issues in schools.</p><p>\"Our challenge is to show teachers that development education is not something extra - it's part and parcel of what they're already doing,\" says Cutler. \"Secondary schoolteachers have a lot of specialist expertise, but sometimes they need a way in. Makutano Junction provides this link between the global dimension and subject areas.\"</p><p>Ruth Newman, an English teacher from Clyst Vale community college in Devon, took part in the pilot and used the soap in work with year 8 and 10 students. Their reactions were very different.</p><p>\"While year 8 enjoyed it straight away, year 10 was more challenging,\" she says. \"They wanted to watch a British soap like EastEnders and found it more difficult to adapt to the different setting and humour.\"</p><p>Year 10s were also more judgmental in their views of other cultures, she says. \"But for that reason, it was the most productive year to work with.\"</p><p>The year 10 group eventually used the soap to support the speaking and listening elements of their GCSE English coursework. Now Newman is looking to establish Makutano Junction across all age groups. \"The danger is that it gets forgotten - we need to sustain the ideas. I'd like to use it in stages across the school so there is no repetition of content.\"</p><p><strong>Bigger picture</strong></p><p>Miranda Liardet, from Whitstone technology college in Somerset, was also involved in the pilot. She feels the resource has helped her pupils to see the bigger global picture. \"We're a small school in the west country and some pupils don't even get to Bristol, which is only 45 minutes away. The challenge for us is to help them look beyond their immediate surroundings and see themselves as global citizens.\"</p><p>Liardet used Makutano Junction on a cross-curriculum day with year 8. They explored the medium of soap operas and linked it with English, drama and PSHE. \"The day was so successful, we're going to use it every year,\" Liardet says.</p><p>But is the soap changing students' perceptions and not just entertaining them?</p><p>\"Students took part in surveys before and after using the resources,\" says Mediae's Lloyd Morgan. \"These findings clearly show that students have increased accurate knowledge and perceptions about Kenya after watching Makutano Junction.\"</p><p>\"My students were very surprised at how similar Kenyans' lives were to ours,\" says Liardet. \"They thought men wore dresses and were surprised to see them in jeans. They were also shocked to see skyscrapers and mobile phones.\"</p><p>Newman reports a similar change in students' perceptions: \"It's sad but you are often challenged by students' prejudices. But this is one of the most important parts of our job - to challenge and hopefully change these preconceptions.\"</p><h2><strong>Weblink</strong></h2><p><strong>Makutano Junction</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.makutanojunction.org.uk\">www.makutanojunction.org.uk</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/worldwise/tv-soap","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/worldwise/tv-soap","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Problems or opportunities","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-14T16:18:22Z","sectionId":"inspire-innovate","id":"inspire-innovate/problems-opportunities","fields":{"body":"<p>It is easy to assume that Africa is a continent of despair, disaster and disarray. But those who live and work there say that there is another story to be told — one of resilience, entrepreneurialism and resourcefulness. Experience shows that out of difficult circumstances can emerge the best kind of innovation — simple yet life-changing for those who embrace it. </p><p>One of the most notable recent examples has been Vodafone's launch of the M-Pesa payment system. M-Pesa started out in Kenya, and is a method of transferring cash that bypasses the need for banks and specialist money transfer services. Users register and then receive a Sim card, which features an application that acts as a virtual wallet. They can put money into their M-Pesa account via agents. This can be transferred via mobile phone to another person, who can then withdraw the cash at another agent. </p><p>None of this might seem innovative to a reader who is used to electronic banking and instant access to their funds, but M-Pesa was initially designed to help Kenyans overcome the problem of the huge distances some people had to travel to money transfer agencies. Initially it was aimed at workers who had moved to city areas wanting to send money back to family and dependants in rural areas. But the scheme has taken off in ways that Vodafone had not anticipated. Customers have been using the service to pay bills, and employers sometimes pay their staff wages via the system. </p><p>Nick Hughes, head of international mobile payment solutions at Vodafone, has been involved in developing M-Pesa since a conference on development issues gave life to the idea of Vodafone using its existing expertise and infrastructure to launch the service. The design has largely been driven by focusing on the needs of customers. </p><p>\"We deliberately spent a long time talking to individuals about what they wanted,\" Hughes says. \"The technology is easy to use and saves people time and money. It really has caught the imagination.\"</p><p>The service has been extended to Tanzania and Afghanistan, and Vodafone is looking at extending the principle to other applications, such as education and health. </p><p>But M-Pesa is by no means a charitable project, with Hughes pointing out that if it weren't a feasible business proposition the company would not be extending it to other markets. In 18 months, four million users have signed up to the service, and 10,000 a day are joining.</p><p><strong>Kicking against poverty</strong></p><p>Also using Kenya as the starting point for its economic development projects is Kickstart, an NGO founded in 1991. Kickstart has become well known in the country for using innovative designs to help bring, according to its slogan, \"the tools to end poverty\". </p><p>It has had success with a seed oil press, but in the mid 1990s it switched its focus to irrigation — an obvious issue in a continent with vast numbers of subsistence farmers, and a barrier to overcoming poverty. The resulting design, the Money Maker pump, has been a huge success in transforming the lives of farmers who previously relied on rainfall to water their crops. The design is radical because it is cheap, easy to install, can be repaired easily and can even be operated by children.</p><p>\"Any useful piece of design is an iterative process,\" says Nick Moon, cofounder of Kickstart. \"And not only does the product have to work functionally, but it has to be something that people feel comfortable with on a cultural level.\" </p><p>He gives the example of one design with pedals that were quite high. When this was trialled, users not only felt that it might be somewhat perilous to be so high off the ground, but in one area of Kenya men said that they felt that, when women used it, it made their buttocks move in a way that was unbecoming. The new design used pedals much closer to the ground.</p><p>Now Kickstart is finalising the design of a new pump that can help farmers with land lies over water reserves more than seven metres below ground level, which is beyond the reach of the current Money Maker pump. </p><p>Mat Hunter, partner at innovation and design consultancy Ideo, thinks other corporations can learn from the experiences of Vodafone and Kickstart in looking far afield for innovation. \"We don't know where the best ideas will come from. The ideas are out there, but you've got to believe that ideas don't just exist in the developed world.\" </p><p>It's an opinion that is echoed in Moon's experiences; \"The image presented of Africa often enough is one of poverty, corruption, Aids and disaster,\" he says. \"Those things are there, but dig deeper and you find it's a place of enormous energy, optimism and resilience. Europe could learn a lot from that attitude.\" </p><h2>Weblinks</h2><p><strong>M-Pesa:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/index.php?id=228\">safaricom.co.ke/index</a><br /><strong>Kickstart:</strong><a href=\"http://www.kickstart.org\"> kickstart.org</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/inspire-innovate/problems-opportunities","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/inspire-innovate/problems-opportunities","sectionName":"Inspire and innovate"},{"webTitle":"Follow the US election coverage live with Anna Pickard","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-04T23:01:45Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"global/cifamerica/2008/nov/04/uselections2008","fields":{"body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p><strong>6pm:</strong> At 7pm ET, all eyes will be on the news channels as the results start to come in, the pundits sing for their supper and the graphics machines go into such overdrive that small puffs of graphic smoke start puffing out the top.</p><p>I'll be here, flicking through the channels, trying to decide who's got the sharpest coverage, the flashiest maps, the choicest quotes, the biggest hair and, most importantly, who's going to claim to call the whole election first.  </p><p>If you're watching the coverage on TV, listening on the radio or following on the internet, join me to cover the coverage and democratise the punditry with any choice observances you happen to witness as, try as I might, I can't watch twelve channels at once.

Seriously, I take back what I ever said about CNN's coverage.  The seven-foot screens were only the beginning.  </p><p>Jessica, you see, was in Chicago, and appeared not by satellite, But By Hologram right there in the middle of the CNN Election Centre.  Perhaps a little smaller than she might be in real life, but just as 3D, she talked directly about what was going on there (nothing, but that's not the point, she was a sodding hologram) and how the technology worked (magic)  and then she suddenly leant forward and whispered urgently: <em>Help me CNN Election Centre, you're my only hope</em> reached out, and the picture flickered to nothing.</p><p>I have no idea what it all means, but it's great to see the advances of technology aren't being wasted.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>7:33pm:</strong> According to my local news - as if any of you care - Frank my friendly local anchor is ruling over a lot of really over-excitable local reporters jabbering faster than they ever have in their life. </p><p>Key points of the election coverage in San Francisco so far, then, include trying to top the queue length of the last correspondent (lines here have been more than TWENTY FIVE minutes long!), saying 'ahhhhhh?' a lot between sentences, and staring into the camera like a startled rabbit.</p><p>However, I will be keeping an eye on it, if you don't mind, because the possible passing of Proposition 8 - which will ban gay marriage only six months after it became legal; a big talking point here.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>7:43pm:</strong> Back on CNN, one of my IM correspondents (I promise you, I have more laptop screens open than CNN here) Mark C, has observed that Brit Hume looks like a man who hasn't got around to taking off his halloween costume yet - and went to the party dressed as the undead.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we've just had a brilliant snafu on Fox - David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager, appeared live via satellite to talk to the immaculately coiffured semi-plasticated Shepherd Smith.  </p><p>\"So David, you've been very busy, and your second child was due yesterday.  Any news yet David?\" Said Shepherd<br/>\"Well, Charlie, it's too early to be exuberant yet, so I'm cautious\"  Said David.</p><p>What? Well, I mean, childbirth is always a nervous time, but come on, it's your second child! What?</p><p>After only a couple more questions, it became clear that while Shepherd was talking to David, David was talking to Charlie on ABC and had no idea that Shepherd and Fox had got the feed all wrong. The possibility of people answering questions entirely inappropriately was tantalising, but never quite lived up to the promise, damnit.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>7:50pm:</strong> My sister is reporting a man with a magnificent rug on the BBC coverage, can anyone confirm?</p><p>On CNBC, a table of four pundits (two laptops) keeps splitting into a siz-way shouting match.  The fact that some of them are actually sitting next to each other in real life means that they're looking left and right when they shout and, when in splitscreen mode, look like the Brady Bunch. It's brilliant.  Quite makes up for the fact that they're shouting \"I think it's WRANG to be a deficit hawk!\" which out of context makes absolutely no sense at all (and doesn't sound like anything the Brady Bunch would say).</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>8:02pm:</strong> With the news from Asta in the comments that NBC is not only making great use of the Rockerfeller Centre Ice Rink for their red/blue map, but also is talking to Ann Curry (\"The same Ann Curry who was once voted America's dumbest TV journalist.\" says Asta) I immediately turn to MSNBC to find stirring horns and many many stars and stripes fluttering in front of the Rockerfeller centre. </p><p>Nothing interesting happens there, though. Lots of graphics reading 'TOO EARLY TO CALL!' - they're all being very cautious, on every channel, in fact - and really don't want to say anything until they're sure. And probably a very good plan.  Does make for slightly less pleasing viewing, though, if we know we're going to have to wait all the way down to the wire to know for sure. <br/>I mean, come <em>on</em>; I'm missing a rerun of Gilmore Girls for this.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>8:10pm:</strong> Incidentally, as the second wave of polls close - I should have mentioned earlier: if you're looking for numbers, stats and hard news on the results as they come in, this blog is totally not the one where you'll find those things.

Hopefully.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>8:21pm:</strong> On CNN, we're cutting by satellite to the places where one loser and one winner will later speak.</p><p>At Camp Obama, Suzanne Malveaux is shouting into a microphone that they've basically had to stick right inside her mouth to be heard.  The last two times they cut to her, they couldn't hear a single word.  This time we can hear, at least, the kind of words you can always hear when people have those rock-star microphones, you can hear someone shouting '<em>FUZZ YOFFLE JZUJZ AN OBAMA SCHZH!</em>\" like they're trying to land a fighter plane. The people in Grant Park behind her are yelling and excited. Very VERY excited.</p><p>Dana Bash is in a ballroom in Phoenix, where a the Phoenix Boy's choir is singing a quiet, mournful number while people stand around and sip wine in a  totally plumberesque, unelitist fashion.  What's the mood there, she's asked by Wolf Blitzer?  Oh, quiet, she says.  Realistic. Stoic. </p><p>Stoic. Interesting word.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>8:42pm:</strong> On Fox, the state is called by a graphic of the faces of McCain and Obama flipping on individual cards like that Victorian optical illusion with a bird on one side and a cage on the other where a spinning thread puts the bird inside the cage.  There is therefore a lot more that could be done with this graphic. McCain on one side of the spinning graphic, a beautiful bouncing baby on the other: spin the graphic, McCain kisses the baby.  Obama on one side of the spinning card, Bill Ayers on the other, spin the card, 'Bama cavorts with terrorists!  Come ON, Fox, you just weren't working hard enough with those now, were you.</p><p>Meanwhile, they're showing the massive swell of supporters who have turned up to Grant Park in hope of seeing a new president speak later on. \"That's a great turn out\" the anchor and correspondent agree. \"Barack Obama; lucky with the weather. AGAIN.\"</p><p>Yes. That's why those people are there. It's not raining.</p><p>Anyone curious about the BBC toupee question, meanwhile, can enter the debate on a more informed level by looking at the screengrab someone's helpfully uploaded for me <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrbiggs/3003525421/\">here</a>.  I say it IS.  What do you say?</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>9:18pm:</strong> If I'm informed one more time on one more channel that 270 is a magic number, I may take 270 pencils, and stick one up a single nostril on 270 news anchors. </p><p>At the moment, as the polls close but remain too close to call and the map fills up with 'Dunno Yet Yellow', the battle of the touchscreen against the CGI is on.  On CNN, voter analysis with crazy hands on a touch-sensitive whiteboard reveals things that people either knew already or can't analyse  - apparently 52% of people said that race was a motivating factor and, in a seperate question, 53% race made no difference to their vote at all.  </p><p>MSNBC, meanwhile, presents the staes so far from entirely within a virtual sentate.  Virtual columns and a virtual whiteboard (that's almost exactly the same size and shape as CNN's REAL whiteboard, but weirdly higher-tech because it's completely non-physical) surround the man who stands by a real podium  - one real laptop in front of him - pointing at the whiteboard behind him that isn't there.</p><p>And yet none of them is saying anything wildly different.  And most of them, with great anticipation and breathless portent, are barely saying anything at all.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>9:35pm:</strong> Katie Couric - and I can't believe we've neglected her so far, apologies to all her fans - is being more strident on CBS than anyone I've so far seen. \"Obama's on 190 votes, on his way to 270\" (270? Really? Is that an important number, then?) \"and the presidency; John  McCain's running out of ways to win.  This is election night in USA\"  she says, sounding a little bit like she's called it already.</p><p>She also has great hair.</p><p>ABC's on the streets of New York, amid the crowds in Times square, shouting happy shouts to keep themselves warm. At least I <em>think</em> that's why they're doing it, unless they've secretly been listening to Katie Couric.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>9:48pm:</strong> You know what's an important number, as well as 270?  3.  Three is, as De La Soul once said, a magic number.  Because the channels don't want to call things until they feel completely sure ...  but then most of them seem to feel sure enough to call it once 3% of precincts in any particular state have declared.</p><p>On ABC, they're going further than Times Square.  Correspondent for the Continent of Africa (I think that's her official title) Dana is in Kenya, in Kogelo, in fact, the ancestral home of the Obama family.  </p><p>We're told, before we speak to her, that the world's press have descended on this tiny, rural community, and we can see the towns people gathered behind Dana on plastic chairs wearing colourful baseball caps, faces lit by something just off screen.</p><p>Before we cut to Dana (by live satellite link), the studio has a question: \"Just how accurate are the results they're getting there?  Are they getting results at all yet? Are they at all up to date?\"</p><p>And how are they getting those?  Is it by smoke signal? Or by carrier pigeon?  Or perhaps - call me crazy - by Live Satellite Link?</p><p>Sadly Dana cannot hear us, ABC's feed keeps cutting out.</p><p>\"In this tiny village, where there are usually only less than 500 people, there is actually a LARGE SCREEN where they are actually watching INTERNATIONAL TELEVISION and the results are actually coming in, as quickly as they are over there, and they're actually CHEERING as the results come in from each state!\"</p><p>Are they?  Actually? In AFRICA? Madness!<br/>Well, they can't be watching it on ABC, then, their feed is shonky. They're probably tuned to the CNN - or someone else with the 3% rule.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>9:56pm:</strong> \"We're going to take a break, while we eat cookies, and then we'll be right back\"</p><p>CNN may have holograms, ABC definitely has a Correspondent  for the Continent of Africa: Fox has biscuits someone's brought in, decorated to look like a high-def widescreen TV tuned immovably to Fox News.</p><p>I can't help but wonder if, as I flick through the channels, I'm always <em>just</em> missing the really awesome technological advances in television graphics.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>10.05pm:</strong> Ok, it's 10pm on the East Coast, Silly AM in the UK and almost Pizza O'Clock at my house, and on twitter I'm seeing lots of people calling it already.  Iowa for Obama, they say, and with California and other big blue states yet to be called, the internet is starting to buzz with early calls.</p><p>\"Every time they call it for Barack, we take a shot\" says <a href=\"http://twitter.com/TinaFey/status/990699933\">Tina Fey on Twitter</a>.  I like the woman's style, but I hope someone else is driving her home, because she's going to be HAMMERED in a minute.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>10:39pm:</strong> It's remarkable when you flick over and see the local channels who don't have the big network billions to throw at fancy graphics.  It feels like you're travelling back in time, like suddenly they'll cut to the weather and someone will start placing large magnetic clouds on gaudy-coloured maps. These flat 2D images of a giant USA, states coloured a stark RED or a BLUE with no sense of sensitive aesthetic judgement involved. </p><p>Hell, on ABC the maps may be flat but they're shaded, county by county throughout the state, redder where the vote is stronger, fading to a  gentle pastel pink blush where the Rebulicans won but only barely.  It's a mottled, marbled view of the major election on a macro scale, and as the analysts take their magic pens and scrawl illustrative circles and arrows and marks on the screen, it somewhat feels like someone's taking a felt tip to a Georges Seurat painting.</p><p>Well, kinda.</p><p>Anyway, as they're moving through, rushing from delicately shaded red state to delicately blushing blue one, it means very little at all - would be great if you could stop and look in depth, but there is not time, for depth, just impressive graphics, my friends. So it basically, at this speed, means feck-all.</p><p>Looks purdy, though.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>10:49pm:</strong> I'd be doing some more channel-flicking if I hadn't got rather stuck staring at Katie Couric.  She really is remarkable.  Looking, I mean.  There's just something ethereal about her.  And I'm trying to decide what that is, so I'm having to watch correspondent after correspondent in split screen interviews until I can see someone next to her in real life to decide.</p><p>Because if she's always in soft focus, that's one thing, and all very well. So then whoever sat next to her would also be in soft focus, and we would know.</p><p>But it's almost more than that.  It's almost as if she looks like she's <strong>always</strong> in soft focus. So if you met her in person, you'd just be overwhelmed by the fact her features are all slightly blurred.  <br/>Perhaps she has a soft downy fur covering her that diffuses the light from the cameras?<br/>Or perhaps, like a beautiful pumpkin lantern, she has some kind of softly flickering internal light source?<br/>Or maybe she releases a fine mist of steam into the air around her, to create a more flattering focus for her face at any angle they might catch?</p><p>Whatever it is, it's remarkable. Please, let's drink to Katie Couric.</p><p>Or, perhaps, to Obama.  Who, from the returns starting to dribble in ever faster, seems to be pulling off a pretty crushing win.  The people in Grant Park in Chicago seem to be feeling it, though.  A million of them, standing and waiting.  A million?  Really? Wow.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>10:56pm:</strong> The internet is buzzing with the rumour that all the networks will call it officially at 11pm ET. That's four minutes from now.</p><p>I'm excitedly waiting, and desperately trying to decide quickly which channel to watch it on.  They're all much of a muchness, but Fox may be sweetest, I suppose...</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>11:02pm:</strong> AND THEY'VE CALLED IT.  </p><p>Every single network, has it on big screens BARACK OBAMA ELECTED PRESIDENT.</p><p>CNN with shots of a cheering Grant Park, Fox with glasses tipped to the end of the nose and a mournful face. MSNBC has college students cheering and children jumping up and down in Times Square, on ANC the noise is deafening.</p><p>This is, frankly, a very exciting thing to watch.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>11:13pm:</strong> \"There's always celebration on one side or the other\" says ABC, with great analytical flair \"but I've never seen anything like this\"</p><p>On CNN, they're quoting from Martin Luth King Jr and from the constitution.</p><p>On Fox they're talking about Bill Ayers ... but then moving on to say what a promising figure Obama is and how they've thought so all along.</p><p>MSNBC are doing a marathon voiceover over crowds of cheering people in Grant Park (\"<em> ... And the remarkable thing about the fact that the analysis will prove that the crowds came out in numbers like were never before imagined when they thought about what kind of numbers might possibly be imaginable at such a time and in such an occasion when ...</em>\" Oh, God Bless rolling news)</p><p>And on the comedy network Stephen Colbert has a parrot on his shoulder.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>11:24pm:</strong> The camera has been lingering on The Reverend Jesse Jackson having a cry in the crowd at grant park for around four minutes now.</p><p>In fact, the only thing that could possibly make them cut away, makes them cut: </p><p><strong>A concession speech by John McCain.</strong></p><p>\"A few minutes ago, I had the honour of calling Senator Obama ...\"</p><p><em>BOOOOO, BOOOOOO!</em> says the crowd, quietened only slightly by the soft padding hands of John McCain.</p><p>\"... and congratulating him\"</p><p><em>Booooo! BOOOOO!</em><br/>Pad pad.  </p><p>He talks about Booker T Washington and the importance of bridging differences, moving on, and supporting the new president whoever they may have supported up till now.</p><p>\"We have failed. And those we fell short, the failure was mine, not yours\" he says, voice cracking.  Before thanking Cindy, the children, and his mother.  HIS MOTHER?  Seriously?</p><p>He thanks Sarah Palin, and the crowd goes absolutely wild.  Palin 2012 it is, then?  She stands next to him, and cries a little.  She's going to speak too, right?</p><p>\"Thank you, and God Bless you and God Bless America\" he ends a gracious and diplomatic and delicate concession speech before leaving and hugging a lady we can only assume to be his mother (as she is about 238)</p><p><strong><em>U! S! A! U! S! A!</em></strong>  Chants the crowd, as crowds will on these kinds of occasions. Will Sarah speak now?  I hope she will. I'll miss her so very, very much.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>11:46pm:</strong> Anderson Cooper, whose name sounds like a firm of accountants, and Wolf Blitzer, whose name sounds like a helicopter hunting trip holiday company from Alaska, are filling time before the President Elect - and that would be Mr Barack Obama (who sounds like a piece of designer wooden furniture) - comes on stage and makes his victory speech.  <br/>There's very little rolling news can add to this moment now.  <br/>It's momentous without any help.</p><p>And so that's where I should leave you, and point you over to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\">Oliver's main liveblog</a>, as unless the graphics start exploding or the hologram comes back (I'm not sure they can afford for the hologram to come back, otherwise they'd all have just done it via hologram all evening, it was that cool) there's not much more I can say.</p><p><strong>Thank you, and good night.</strong></p><p><em>Thanks for reading, and for your comments.

Its founder, Dr Nathan Wolfe, said that the development could have a huge impact.</p><p>\"Every hour, on every continent, viruses move from animals into people,\" he said. \"Working in animal markets, with restaurant workers and with hunters at the end of the road, we sort through this traffic to stop deadly diseases before they spread.\"</p><p>Google will also be contributing $2.5m to a scheme run by the Mailman School of Public Health, based at Columbia University in New York, which aims to speed up its programme to discover new pathogens.</p><p>The other organisations receiving grants as part of the announcement include the <a href=\"http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/portal/server.pt\">International Research Institute for Climate and Society</a> – also at Columbia – and the <a href=\"http://www.ucar.edu/\">University Corporation for Atmospheric Research</a>, which will both receive $900,000 to improve weather prediction and forecasting.</p><p>Although it may not appear that the weather has a strong influence on the spread of diseases, Google.org programme director Frank Rijsberman said it was crucial to improve forecasting in conjunction with the identification of disease \"hot spots\" across Africa and south-east Asia.</p><p>\"We think it has a critical role to play,\" he said. \"For example, the last major outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Kenya – which affects cattle and spills over into people – was actually predicted several months in advance through a weather forecast. It was going to be wet, and that meant there were going to be a lot more mosquitos, and the mosquitos – if they reach a certain threshold – were likely to pass on the disease.\"</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.whrc.org/\">Woods Hole Research Center</a>, based in Massachusetts, will receive $2m to produce satellite images of forests in the developing world to help understand how the environment affects the spread of diseases.</p><p>Google has pledged to contribute 1% of all its profits to charity, as well as giving Google.org 3m shares in the parent company – currently valued at more than $1bn.</p><p>As part of its wide-ranging mission to develop new ideas in energy, the environment and global poverty, the organisation has already made significant investments in geothermal energy, solar technologies and wind power.</p><p>Rijsberman said that how much more was put into these schemes would depend on how successful they become.</p><p>\"In renewable energy we have started with large investments, while in this initiative we have started with grants but expect to move into investments in diagnostics companies later.

As in, if you give a celebrity the chance to interact directly with all the people who are interested in communicating with them, can they do it without losing their integrity or mind?</p><p>The question about scaling is the one that venture capitalists used to ask of would-be flourishing companies. \"Will it scale?\" they would ask. Meaning, if your internet-based business grows exponentially, will you need an exponentially growing number of people to handle new code, customer problems and so on? (The question they ask now is \"where's the profit?\")</p><p>But what about celebrities? Our Petri dish for this intriguing question is the microblogging service Twitter, and two of Britain's top achievers: Andy Murray, our best tennis player, and Stephen Fry - actor, writer, presenter, geek and regular columnist for this paper.</p><p>First, the 21-year-old Murray, whose style could best be described as gnomic: \"going to bed - get some rest. couldn't get the win today. jamie flying back tomorrow morning, training at ntc in afternoon. catch you later,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andy_murray/statuses/958147145\">he wrote</a>. Translation: lost doubles match with brother. Leaving Spain and will be at Britain's National Tennis Centre (the NTC) on Tuesday.</p><p>His visibility on Twitter is not high. He's got nearly 500 people following what he does out of a million-plus using it, and follows (the Twitter comments of) fewer than 30. Plus, he doesn't respond to anyone; to him, Twitter is a write-only forum.</p><p>In contrast let's look at that self-confessed gadget freak, 51-year-old Stephen Fry. Not only is he on our TV screens travelling across the US, he's also now on our computer screens, travelling through Kenya with his iPhone, watching rhinos being tranquillised and posting pictures. He only joined Twitter on October 9, yet over the course of a weekend acquired an incredible 4,500+ followers - and is also \"following\", or (notionally) reading the updates of almost the same number.</p><p>And he does: he responds to messages aimed at him that are worth answering. It's a real, two-way conversation, intermediated by the internet, visible to everyone.</p><p>It's interesting that it's the older person who turns out to have more time for his fans. You might think Murray's schedule - involving lots of training, long tennis matches and hours on a plane - doesn't allow for a lot of online interaction. But Fry is busy too: columns to write, TV shows to compere, documentaries to record. I wonder if Fry wouldn't envy Murray's long periods in between matches and training schedules during which he has the chance to read and to interact with people. I suspect Fry may be the busier.</p><p>Of course, Murray's fame isn't directly dependent on his interaction with his public; it's about what he does on a tennis court. But for sports stars, the big money is in endorsements, from clothes to washing powder. If they can use services like Twitter to persuade us they're human, they'll be more saleable.</p><p>Interacting individually with thousands of people isn't feasible. But Fry gives us an interesting insight into how to fake it: he skims through the comments on his pictures or tweets, and provides portmanteau answers (\" You're all sick! Sick you hear? Eating a [rhino] ear notch! They're notched for identification, btw.\"). It's interaction; the sort Murray, who like most tennis players dislikes answering repetitive questions from the press, might actually enjoy.</p><p>All this shows that celebrity can scale in this connected world; you just have to be the right sort of person.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/16/blogging-stephen-fry-andy-murray","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2008/oct/16/blogging-stephen-fry-andy-murray","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"Rwanda to switch from French to English in schools","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-13T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2008/oct/14/rwanda-france","fields":{"body":"<p>The Rwandan government is to switch the country's entire education system from French to English in one of the most dramatic steps to date in its move away from Francophone influence. </p><p>Officially the change is to reposition Rwanda as a member of the East African Community, an organisation made up mostly of English-speaking countries such as neighbours Uganda and Tanzania.</p><p>However, the shift to education solely in English is part of a wholesale realignment away from French influence that includes applying to join the Commonwealth - if accepted Rwanda would be only the second member, after Mozambique, that has not been a British colony - and establishing a cricket board.</p><p>Underpinning the move is a long and bitter dispute with France born of its support for the Hutu regime that oversaw the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis, which has seen the French ambassador expelled and the closure of the French cultural centre, international school and radio station. </p><p>However, what amounts to an attempt to expel the French language too, consigning it to a few hours a week in schools and increasingly forcing it out of the workings of government, will be badly received in Paris where protection of the language is at the heart of what critics describe as the French obsession with maintaining influence in Africa and which led it to back the Hutu extremist government.</p><p>No timetable has been set to implement the policy, which will face a number of challenges, including finding sufficient teachers who speak English. The cabinet also decided that all public service workers will receive English instruction.</p><p>English was made an official language in Rwanda, alongside French and the indigenous Kinyarwanda, after the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) overthrew the Hutu regime and took power in 1994.</p><p>The RPF leadership, dominated by Tutsis raised in exile in Anglophone countries, generally speaks English and not French. Rwanda's minister of education, Daphrosa Gahakwa, grew up in Uganda where she took her O levels. She studied her PhD in genetic engineering at the University of East Anglia.</p><p>English has also become fashionable even among French-speaking young people in the cities, particularly Tutsis, as a means of rejecting Francophone influence and its association with the Hutu regime responsible for the genocide.</p><p>At present the first three years of primary school is in Kinyarwanda after which pupils may choose English or French. The French option is to be dropped. </p><p>Instruction at Kigali's elite Institute of Science and Technology is already in English and it is increasingly the language of instruction in the national university. </p><p>The drive towards English is in part financial. Close trading ties not only with other east African nations such as Uganda and Kenya but also with South Africa, which has provided investment for luxury hotels and shopping malls, have helped drive an economic boom in Rwanda. </p><p>The Rwandan trade and industry minister, Vincent Karega, told Kigali's New Times newspaper that the country is looking beyond the Francophone world. </p><p>\"French is spoken only in France, some parts of west Africa, parts of Canada and Switzerland,\" he said. \"English has emerged as a backbone for growth and development not only in the region but around the globe.\"</p><p>There is little doubt that a deep loathing of all things French is also an important factor for some of Rwanda's leaders. </p><p>The latest salvo against French influence comes weeks after the Rwandan government accused more than 30 French politicians, officials and military officers of complicity in the genocide, including the late president, Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand, and called for their prosecution. </p><p>A two-year investigation by an official commission alleged that French forces in Rwanda committed crimes against humanity and protected those who organised the genocide, helping them to flee the country and escape justice. </p><p>The Rwandan inquiry followed allegations by France's leading anti-terrorism judge, Jean-Louis Brugui&egrave;re, that in effect accused Rwanda's Tutsi president, Paul Kagame, of bringing mass murder on his own people by allegedly ordering the 1994 assassination of the then president, Juvenal Habyarimana, which marked the start of the genocide. </p><p>The judge could not indict Kagame as head of state but he issued international arrest warrants for nine of his closest aides and advised the tribunal trying those behind the genocide to pursue Kagame.</p><h2>Backstory</h2><p>France's claim that Rwanda was a French-speaking nation was always somewhat disingenuous given that 80% of the population spoke only Kinyarwanda fluently. But there was no doubt about France's influence over the former Belgian colony. </p><p>It remains strong in other Francophone countries in Africa from the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west and central African nations where the national currencies are underpinned by French financial support. </p><p>French remains an important language of commerce and diplomacy in west and central Africa, so much so Ghana recently decided its officials should learn it so as not to be marginalised by the likes of Senegal. </p><p>There is little doubt English is encroaching on French influence, not only because it is the language of business in Europe but because of the economic power of South Africa.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/13/rwanda140x84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/rwanda-france","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/oct/14/rwanda-france","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Farmers will grow drought resistant crops 'in four years'","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-07T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2008/oct/07/gmcrops.food","fields":{"body":"<p>Genetically modified crops that are drought resistant will be grown by farmers within four to five years, according to scientists developing the technology.</p><p>Dr David Dennis, the chief executive of Performance Plants Incorporated in Kingston, Ontario, said varieties of drought-tolerant oilseed rape and maize were already being tested in field trials in the US. He claimed the new varieties can increase yield by 40% when the plants are most water-stressed.</p><p>Climate scientists predict that global warming will make arable land in many developing countries less productive or unusable. Advocates of GM crops often defend the technology by arguing that drought and salt-tolerant varieties can play an important role in adapting to global warming.</p><p>Last month, the then UK science minister Dr Ian Pearson told the Guardian he thought the British public would support GM if the industry demonstrated environmental benefits. </p><p>\"I think that the public want to see benefits for GM technology for the consumer, not just for the fertiliser company or the farmer. If GM can demonstrably provide benefits for people living in sub-Saharan Africa then I think the public will want to support those as products and want to see them commercialised,\" he said.</p><p>But GM's opponents counter that drought and salt tolerance always seems to be just out of reach. \"We would take any claims that these crops are just around the corner with a large pinch of salt because we have heard it all before,\" said Claire Oxborrow of Friends of the Earth. So far, almost all GM varieties available commercially are either tolerant of herbicides or produce their own pesticide.</p><p>She said that companies are using the food crisis and the threat of climate change as a PR opportunity. \"We are seeing a lot more promises, especially now connected with the food crisis,\" she said.</p><p>Dennis said his company is developing several crops with modifications to existing genes which result in a variety of different effects. The company plans to license its technology to major crop companies such as Syngenta and Pioneer.</p><p>Drought-tolerant oilseed rape plants, which have been in field trials in the American Mid-West, Colorado and California for four years, are at the most advanced stage. A drought tolerant variety of maize has been tested in field trials for two years. The company is also working on modifications for more efficient water use, larger seeds, heat tolerance and increased biomass. The latter modification is aimed at producing fast-growing material for the nascent biofuel industry.</p><p>Dennis predicted that it would take four to five years of field testing and clearing regulatory hurdles before the plants can be sold. \"You've got to show that it will work in situ in the field over several years,\" he said. </p><p>One concern is that the plants may cross with wild relatives, potentially creating a drought-resistant super-weed that becomes impossible to eradicate. Dennis said that this was a remote possibility because hybrids between his crop varieties and wild species do not survive well.</p><p>\"Is there a risk in it? There's risk in everything we do,\" he said. \"I think the risk is so small I'm not worried about it. But I am worried about what we do if we don't develop these technologies.\" </p><p>He said the world needed a 21st century version of the \"green revolution\" to increase crop yields to feed the projected world population of 9 billion by 2050.</p><p>Dennis said his company would also make the technology freely available to farmers in the developing world. Performance Plants signed an agreement with Africa Harvest Biotech Foundation International — an NGO based in Kenya that has previously collaborated with Monsanto — which allows them to distribute the technology without paying licence fees. </p><p>\"If the technology is used by small farmers we will forgo any royalties. It will be available to them free of charge,\" said Dennis. The group is also beginning work on pursuing similar genetic modifications in local crops such as sorghum and cassava. </p><p>The company identified its target genes by inducing genetic changes in up to 100,000 plants — for example by blasting them with x-rays — and screening them for desirable characteristics. Dennis's researchers then select those plants with the desired characteristics. The drought tolerant varieties have a mutation that changes the activity of an enzyme called farnesyltransferase. The modification leads to changes in the way the plant reacts to a hormone that is involved in its response to low water levels. \"The plant responds to drought a lot faster and more effectively than other plants,\" said Dennis.</p><p>Oxborrow said she was sceptical that significant drought tolerance could be achieved with a single gene change. \"The reason we haven't seen drought tolerant crops come to commercial reality so far is because the plant physiology is much more complicated than the relatively simple technology around herbicide tolerance and insect resistance,\" she said. \"Plant scientists are still working out how plants cope with water shortage.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/02/maize84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/gmcrops.food","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/oct/07/gmcrops.food","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Athletics: the next Everest","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-04T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/2008/oct/05/sportfeatures.athletics","fields":{"body":"<p>One of the mighty unscaled peaks of athletics lost a little more of its once presumed invincibility last Sunday when Haile Gebrselassie gave the world a glimpse of the first sub two-hour marathon. More than four decades since the sport's last great conquests - Roger Bannister's destruction of the four-minute-mile barrier in 1954 and Jim Hines' breaking 10 seconds for the 100 metres in 1968 - the same lasting legacy achieved by these two men now beckons a long-distance runner. </p><p>A week ago, Gebrselassie, the Ethiopian runner who would be precious little use in a pub brawl but with a bird-like frame, long stride and voracious oxygen uptake that make him a super-efficient distance runner, surpassed even the high expectations that preceded his run over the fast, flat course in Berlin. His time of two hours three minutes 59 seconds sliced 27 seconds off his own world marathon record and, by breaking through the 2:04 barrier, scattered the clouds that had obscured the sub-two-hour peak. </p><p>Expert opinion is deeply divided over how long it will take before the summit is reached, and some even remain doubtful whether it ever will be. Plenty of authoritative voices say otherwise, though, none with greater conviction than David Bedford, the former world-record holder for 10,000 metres and now race director of the London Marathon. 'Without doubt I will see a two-hour marathon in my lifetime,' Bedford, who is 58, says. 'It might be towards the end of my life. It might be another 20 years. But, yes, it will definitely happen.' </p><p>Bud Baldaro, who has been UK Athletics' marathon coach, agrees with Bedford. 'I think it will happen now,' he says. 'They have been getting significantly closer for the past four or five years and I think that in the next 20 years someone who has the running economy and track-running pedigree of Gebrselassie or Kenenisa Bekele [the world 10,000m record holder] will do it.' </p><p>The doubters include Ron Hill, who in 1970 was probably the first runner to go under the 2hr 10min mark, the only other sub 2:10 time having been over a course now reckoned to have been short of the full distance. He maintains his position despite having once said 2:05 could not be beaten. 'I said that would be the limit before the altitude runners began to show their potential,' Hill says. He also cites pre-race diet, in-race fuel supplies and pacemakers, unheard of in his time, as reasons for the record now being faster than he previously thought possible. </p><p>Hill might have thrown in the considerable incentive provided by financial rewards. Gebrselassie earned &pound;102,000 plus an undisclosed appearance fee for his third win in Berlin.</p><p>Glenn Latimer, one of the world's leading marathon authorities who oversees long-distance running in the United States, is as sceptical as Hill about the likelihood of anyone breaking through the two-hour barrier, describing it as 'a far-off dream'. He was in a lead vehicle watching Gebrselassie run in Berlin last weekend, and says: 'You could tell from Haile's face over the last four or five kilometres that it was hard work. Although his form remained brilliant and he was very smooth, he was showing stress. </p><p>'If you look at what his splits were, averaging around 14 minutes 45 seconds for each five kilometres, they're amazing. You're talking something else altogether to go down significantly below this.' </p><p>Latimer says he would be staggered if a time of under two hours were ever recorded. Ever? 'They'd have to invent some very good drugs for it to happen because we know what happens to the body after 30 kilometres. It really starts to suffer and break down.' </p><p>Gebrselassie, 35, himself a believer in the two-hour marathon - 'Maybe in 20 years, maybe 40 years. The more technology develops, the more athletes will run faster' - reeled off kilometres at between 2min 53.8sec and 2:58.2 as he broke the record he set a year ago in the same race. There have been seven world records in the event - four men's, three women's - whose date in late September more or less guarantees a perfect temperature (this year between 10C at the start and 14C at the finish). 'The course is fast, the weather was perfect and the rain the day before made everything fresh,' Gebrselassie said. 'And the pacemakers were good. You don't often get all these things together.' </p><p>The luxury of pacemakers referred to enviously by Hill and the unexpectedly strong run by Kenya's James Kwambai, who lowered his personal best by nearly five minutes in finishing second in 2:05:36, were important factors in Gebrselassie's run.</p><p>Although only one of four pacemakers who were there to ensure a world-record tempo, the Kenyan Abel Kirui, survived the relentlessly high pace beyond 30km, before being dropped at 32km, Kwambai clung on and appeared briefly to be capable of staying with Gebrselassie until the finish. 'Haile looked over and you could see him wondering, \"Who is this guy?\",' Latimer says. Eventually, though, even Kwambai was burned off with just over 5km to go, which had the positive effect of relieving Gebrselassie of having to engage in a tactical battle over the closing stages.</p><p>With just the clock to beat as the finishing line approached, Gebrselassie wound up the pace to produce his fastest 5km split between the 35km and 40km marker - a savagely quick 14min 29sec - which carried him to his 26th world best, over distances ranging from two miles to the marathon, in 14 years. </p><p>Put in terms of seconds per kilometre, the task of raising the pace from the one Gebrselassie ran last Sunday to the one that would be needed to complete a two-hour marathon does not seem especially daunting: 2min 55sec pace would have to come down to 2:51. Expressed in terms of distance, though, and a mere four seconds seems very different. It is around 24 metres per kilometre, which would be regarded as a substantial winning margin in a 1,000m race. </p><p>It is a figure that places Alan Storey, the UK Athletics' senior performance manager, on the side of those who believe two hours for the marathon is, as he puts it, 'somewhere between very unlikely and impossible'. </p><p>Storey alludes to the old brain-teaser about how many jumps it would take to reach a tree if every time you leapt forward you covered half the distance of your previous jump. The answer is you would never reach the tree. For tree read two-hour marathon and the same answer applies, Storey reasons, to the question of how many attempts it would take to gain those 24 metres per kilometre. </p><p>'Given all of the science that we have available now, I have seen nothing to suggest another huge improvement could be made,' Storey says. 'If some exercise physiologist discovers something new and exciting then anything could be possible, but given all of the information we know about I don't expect to see two hours broken in my lifetime - and I'm a youthful 63.' </p><p>Asked about what new and exciting things might be out there, Storey says: 'If I had any idea what they were I'd have people working on them now - under wraps so that we could use them in 2012. No doubt these physiologists are trying to find ways to cope with the stresses of running marathons, but I don't know anybody from a science background who thinks two hours is likely.' </p><p>David Bedford might not claim to be from a scientific background, but he was an extraordinary runner who lowered the world 10,000m record by 7.6sec in 1973 when he ran 27min 30.80sec, a time that only three British runners have beaten in the 35 years since. He became so addicted to training that he covered more than 200 miles per week. 'It made me incredibly strong,' he says, 'but it also kept me injured a lot of the time.' This is the experience on which he draws to make the argument, contrary to Storey's and others, that it is not whether but when the 120 minutes for the marathon will be breached. </p><p>Bedford believes it will be achieved simply through what he calls a continuing evolution of times. 'For example,' he says, 'if you take Kenenisa Bekele as the No1 10,000-metre runner at the moment, he is significantly faster than Haile Gebrselassie over the distance - so therefore I believe that when he and his generation move up to the marathon we will start to see times like two hours two-and-a-half minutes or even two hours two minutes. And this will continue. So what I think we are talking about is maybe three generations from now athletes getting it into their heads that it is possible. </p><p>'You need to look back to the previous most famous barrier, the four-minute mile. For a long time people didn't think it was possible and then all of a sudden one whole generation started to believe it could happen and started to work towards it. But that generation had to be near enough to it to sense that it was possible. </p><p>'Although Gebrselassie and Bekele are amazing, I don't think their generation of distance runners is close enough to two hours for the marathon to see it as possible. However, they will continue the erosion of times and a future generation, two or three down the line - so you're talking 10 to 15 years - will be the first to run two hours one-and-a-half minutes, or something like that, and will start believing that two hours can be done.' </p><p>Believing you can break a record as a necessary prerequisite to actually breaking it is something that Tim Noakes, the South African doctor and long-distance runner, has spoken about. In reference to Bannister's four-minute mile, Noakes has said: 'He was able to convince his brain that it could achieve what none had done before.'</p><p>Bedford backs up his argument by citing the one-hour barrier for the half marathon, which withstood all attempts at it until Moses Tanui of Kenya ran 59min 47sec in Milan on 3 April 1993. Since then Tanui has been joined by 34 others who between them have gone under 60 minutes on a further 69 occasions. 'That again was something that was viewed as not possible,' Bedford says. 'As soon as people start running 55 minutes for a half marathon [the record stands at 58:33], the world will be ready for the first two-hour marathon.' </p><p>The assumption that a man will be the first to run two hours is not necessarily safe. Bedford, though, forthrightly declares that a woman will not do it for at least 250 years, while Bud Baldaro believes that it will be done by 'someone with a very simple lifestyle'. </p><p>'Ethiopian and Kenyan runners have shown over the past three decades what can be achieved and I wonder what might come out of Asia and South America when the world changes even more,' Baldaro says. He doubts US or European runners will be involved. 'The Western lifestyle is so complicated and complex now that the guys find it very difficult to sacrifice everything to run 150, 160 miles a week.' </p><p>As to where the first sub two-hour marathon might be run, Berlin in the autumn is the obvious answer, although Bedford has not given up on London staging the historic event.</p><p>'Remember that Paula Radcliffe's two-fifteen-twenty-five, which stands above and beyond what anyone else has done in the women's marathon, was done in London,' he says, 'and also Khalid Kannouchi did two-five-thirty-eight in the men's event in 2002. So on the right day London is certainly able to have a world record again.' </p><p>And could it be that in 20 years' time David Bedford will still be the race director who secures the runner who makes history through the streets of London? 'I think in 20 years' time I will have spent the morning of the marathon in the hospitality tent and the afternoon sound asleep,' Bedford says.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2008/10/04/HaileGebrselassie84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/05/sportfeatures.athletics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2008/oct/05/sportfeatures.athletics","sectionName":"Sport"},{"webTitle":"Barney Ronay: Kenyan trailblazers turn their talents to cycling","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-17T11:31:12Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/blog/2008/sep/16/tourdefrance.cycling1","fields":{"body":"<p>Here's an interesting fact: despite being recognised through their distance running as among the finest endurance athletes on the planet, no Kenyan or Ethiopian has ever ridden the Tour de France. In fact, no Kenyan, Ethiopian or black African of any nation has ever become a professional cyclist. </p><p>Team GB's prodigious success in the saddle in Beijing drew a degree of rather measly sniping along these lines. It seems unfair to disparage the achievements of individual athletes, who can only beat the field in front of them. But the fact remains. Africans don't cycle - and for a variety of reasons, mainly to do with habit and tradition, but also things like start-up costs and prohibitively expensive racing technology.</p><p>For the first time, however, there is a suggestion this might not always be the case. Last month two amateur Kenyan cyclists, Zakayo Nderi, a shoe-shiner by trade, and Samwel Myangi, a 24-year-old bicycle taxi rider, performed a time trial on the Alpe D'Huez, a blue chip Tour stage finish. This is a serious test: 13.8km at an average gradient of 7.9% with 21 hairpin bends. </p><p>Zakayo and Myangi rode in a traditional Thursday morning mass time-trial. After a hugely promising 46-minute opening stab, they emerged with best times of 42 minutes for Zackary and 43 minutes for Myangi. These would have placed the riders comfortably within the top 50 in the 2004 Tour de France time trial, five minutes down on Lance Armstrong's winning mark that year. </p><p>At this point it's worth stressing a few things about the two riders. Neither had ever been to Europe before. It had taken an exhausting 18-month struggle just to secure 20-day visas to enter the country. Neither has had any coaching - either in terms of physical conditioning or the technical business of the bike itself. These are complete amateurs. Their only previous cycling experience involved riding around pot-holed Kenyan roads on the infamous Black Mamba bike, a 20kg beast with no gears. </p><p>As novice first attempts, the times on the Alpe are stunning. Not to mention a huge fillip for the driving force behind getting them there, Nicholas Leong, a cycling enthusiast and long-time Tour de France follower. \"I'm doing this as a fan,\" he says of a project that has so far eaten up all his savings from his primary career as a commercial photographer. It's a process that has also involved a great deal of faith. </p><p>\"I'd seen the first black players turning up in English football and the first black African athletes winning marathons in the 1990s,\" he says. \"I always expected an African to turn up in cycling and it didn't happen.\"  </p><p>Leong's inspiration ultimately came from the Singapore marathon. The men's race has been won by a Kenyan runner for the past six years. In 2006 13 of the first 15 places were filled by Kenyans, who were in town as part of their annual tour of the global road-racing circuit. </p><p>The day after the race Leong bought an air ticket to Nairobi, gambling, correctly, that the runners he had seen would be leaving on the same plane: \"I said to them, 'wherever you're going, I'm coming with you'.\"</p><p>Fortunately, his companions on the flight were from Eldoret, a town that sits 2100 metres above sea level and has provided the rump of Kenya's recent distance running talent. It was there that Leong began trying to lure some of the town's amateur runners into the switch to cycling. \"I wasted a lot of time doing that,\" he says. 'They weren't interested.\"</p><p>In the end he came across a local cycling club whose members staged ad hoc races. Leong picked out the four most talented riders and offered to train them for a couple of months in Singapore (\"I just gave them a bike and said 'ride as fast as you can'\"). Eventually the two quickest, Zakayo and Myangi, were taken to France for their shot at the Alpe. </p><p>Zakayo's English is halting. He says training has been \"very difficult\" but \"exciting\" and that he \"would like to compete in the Tour de France, that is my dream\". </p><p>Dreams have been important in all this. Before meeting Leong Zakayo would get up at 5am and train on his own, cycling 50km before doing a full day's work as a shoe-shine. He had no clear purpose in mind. Shortly before Leong arrived his wife had had a dream that someone would come and take him away on a mission. And so it proved. </p><p>The brief spell in Singapore saw the Kenyans sit on a proper racing bike for the first time. \"It was much faster than a Black Mamba,\" Zakayo chuckles. \"It felt really good. At first I did have some crashes. It was just so fast.\"</p><p>Before the time trial Zakayo had another dream, one in which he killed a lion. If the lion wasn't exactly slain this time around, it certainly ought to be looking slightly warily over its shoulder. \"I can go faster, definitely, much faster,\" he says, matter-of-factly. \"Now I know the course I can go much faster. It was all new for me before. Next time I will be much better.\" </p><p>Leong's goal is to set up a permanent presence in Kenya, an academy with regular competitions, which might act as a feeder system for professional teams. For that to happen he needs sponsors, coaches, anybody with expertise who might be willing to take a punt on a stunning novice performance in France. </p><p>\"I started this because the people with the most potential have not been given the chance to cycle,\" he says.  \"There's so much talent there, even if it's not this generation of riders who manage to do something amazing, maybe the next will.\"</p><p>Leong is certainly a trailblazer. And one, perhaps, with the tide of history on his side. </p><p>By way of an example: the first ever Singapore marathon was won by Britain's Ray Crabbe in 1982. It was 15 years before Africans began to compete. In 2006 a Kenyan, Elijah Mbogo, won it in a time over 23 minutes quicker than Crabbe's.  </p><p>Cycling, you have been warned.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/Cyclists-84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/16/tourdefrance.cycling1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/16/tourdefrance.cycling1","sectionName":"Sport"},{"webTitle":"Children of the revolution","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-30T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2008/aug/31/secondaryschools.schools","fields":{"body":"<p>orbidding red-brick estates line the streets. Children choose their routes nervously round here, knowing that there are certain flats, families, corners of gang territory best avoided. Yet in front of me walk three girls, impeccably turned out in what appears to be the uniform of a posh private school: grey blazers with red piping, neat skirts and black tights. They look affluent and confident as they turn through the gates of their school, a low-rise palace of wood and glass, splashed with primary colours.</p><p>But this is not a posh private school, although it was designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership: 40 per cent of children here are on free school meals, 35 per cent are on the special needs register and 55 of those are statemented, meaning that they have the most severe problems. The surrounding area is so rough that teachers escort the children on to buses at the end of the day and patrol the streets in pairs.</p><p>The school is Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney, east London, one of the first of a new type of educational institution to open in Britain, and in the vanguard of a controversial attempt to galvanise state education by removing schools from local authority control. Forty-seven new academies will open their doors this week, bringing the total across the country to 130. The government intends that a further 100 will open in the next two years. </p><p>An academy is an independent school within the state system, backed by a sponsor who - if an individual or business, rather than a university or school - puts up &pound;2m towards the capital costs (almost all academies are in brand new buildings). The running costs are supplied by central government at the same level as for any state school, although they include the sum that a local authority would 'top-slice' to fund facilities shared between its schools. The sponsor has the power to appoint governors and oversee the curriculum.</p><p>The academies' many critics object that they are unaccountable locally. They say that they threaten to create a two-tier system of education, and that if the early versions have been successful it is mainly because they have had vast amounts of money and government attention lavished on them. They point to high rates of exclusion, which seem to suggest academies may only be prepared to teach certain pupils. And they worry about sponsors' jurisdiction over the curriculum: a couple of high-profile sponsors are evangelical Christians.</p><p>They should be worrying, although they have made much less of this, about sponsors' roles  in the design of school buildings. A number of academy backers are so in thrall to the idea of schools-like-businesses and, perhaps, to their starry architects (who include Zaha Hadid and Norman Foster as well as Rogers) that they have signed off buildings with no outdoor play space, inadequate dining halls and nowhere for the whole school to gather. </p><p>I visited one academy, designed by Foster and Partners, on a sunny day when all the walkways (the place is way too modern for corridors) were lit by electric light. The Thomas Deacon Academy in Peterborough has cost &pound;50m to date: the principal, Alan McMurdo, says the final bill still isn't in. Following protests from the children about the lack of play space, there are now benches outside, but the dining room is still too small. There are no bells, which McMurdo presents as a positive, educational choice, but he couldn't possibly have all 2,200 children moving around the school together. </p><p>Critics also object that the academy programme is intellectually incoherent: if independence over budgets, governance and curriculum is such a great thing, why not give it to all schools? And they question the motivation of sponsors, who, for an outlay of around &pound;1.2m when tax benefits are taken into account (against average new-build costs of between &pound;25m and &pound;30m, all supplied by the government) get their hands on a vanity project - a school they can name after themselves and run as they like. It did not help the academies' cause that in April 2006, Des Smith, a council member of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, was caught out telling a journalist that honours could be lined up for backers. Smith was promptly disowned by the SSAT.</p><p>But academies seem unstoppable. David Cameron launched his schools policy at Mossbourne. It is widely believed that Tony Blair exacted a promise from Gordon Brown that the manifesto commitment to 200 academies by 2010 and subsequent decision to enlarge that number to 400 would be honoured. Mossbourne is the school that is said to have persuaded Brown to agree.</p><p>Inside this school, apparently the most popular in Britain - at least with politicians - the atmosphere is not what you might expect of a state secondary school in a challenging area. Clearly, it's nothing like that of the school that once stood on this site, the notorious Hackney Downs, once branded the worst school in Britain and one of the first to be shut in the school closures programme. There is an air of calm purposefulness here, and palpable success.</p><p>Mossbourne is the top school in the country for value-added results. If the Key Stage 3 results at age 14 feed through into GCSEs, which the school's first cohort will take this year, 80 per cent of pupils should get 5 A*-Cs. The principal, Sir Michael Wilshaw, insists this is not because the school massages its intake. Children are banded according to ability and those who live closest to the school in each band are given priority.</p><p>Mossbourne does not exercise its right to select 10 per cent of its pupils on ability. Wilshaw introduces me in the corridor to a boy who scored nothing at all in his Sats at primary school and two years later is achieving level 4, the national average. 'My central purpose,' Wilshaw says, 'is to show you can take children from poor backgrounds, with low prior attainment, and make them succeed.'</p><p>At Mossbourne, teachers do this through intensive work with children who are lagging behind. In a 'nurture' group of Year 8s (aged 12-13), there is one teacher to 15 pupils, plus three teaching assistants. </p><p>Mossbourne pupils are on a tight leash. A teacher (they all seem mysteriously young and good-looking here) stands at the school gates in the morning, correcting minor infractions of uniform before pupils are allowed to enter. I have never seen a school where the uniform is worn so exactingly. Staff stand on the stairs between lessons, watching the pupils move up and down. Minor offences such as rudeness to a teacher mean staying behind until 6pm to be taught by one of the senior staff and then being collected by a parent. For worse offences, children come to school on Saturday.</p><p>A week after I first went to Mossbourne, I returned for a concert. The standard was high, but the event was also inclusive (some of the school's 19 autistic children were involved). The music was divided into pop, soul, world and swing, and there was dancing, including a conga in which the principal participated. So it's strict, but not stuffy. Wilshaw claims that once parents realise the methods are working they don't object to the discipline. The staff have no hours-contract, as they do in most state schools; they are, however, better paid. The day I visited, they'd just been told they were getting a 20 per cent results-linked bonus.</p><p>The government has invested a huge amount of hope in Mossbourne, and similar schools. When Unity City Academy in Middlesbrough went into special measures, not long after being formed by the amalgamation of two predecessor schools, central government gave it &pound;6m to sort itself out and parachuted in a proven management team. When I ask the principal at Unity City, Bob Dore, if this would have happened in any other kind of school, he says, 'It would depend on the local authority.' No, then.</p><p>So academies are getting more attention and, in some cases, more money. There's nothing to stop sponsors writing cheques beyond their &pound;2m initial outlay, and they're free to raise funds through their networks. When Wilshaw walks me through the theatre at Mossbourne, he says casually that his sponsor, Sir Clive Bourne, 'got a mate' to pay for the beautiful, retractable red-raked seating. An academy like Mossbourne would be an attractive proposition to donors, combining success with being seen to be doing something about deprivation.</p><p>Yet where new academies are proposed, there is often extreme hostility, not least from teaching unions. A few days after visiting Mossbourne I went to Barrow-in-Furness to witness a protest against the amalgamation of three existing schools into an academy. The demonstration was directed at the schools minister, Lord Adonis, who had been visiting.</p><p>As a young tyke at Tony Blair's Number 10 Policy Unit, Andrew Adonis was the architect of the academies programme. Now ennobled and a schools minister, he had earlier that day met two of the four Barrow borough councillors recently elected on the 'Our Schools Are Not For Sale' ticket. They told him 6,000 people in a town of 60,000 had signed a petition against the proposed academy. Some of the objectors are ideologically opposed to what they see as the privatisation of state education; others are worried more practically about an overflow of children who won't get into the new academy, fearing it will create a sink school nearby.</p><p>This gets to the heart of concerns about academies. They seem, so far, to be working - not all as spectacularly as Mossbourne, but much better than most of the struggling inner-city schools they replaced. The question is, at what cost? There are persistent stories of high rates of exclusion at academies; fears that, in  journalist and education campaigner Fiona Millar's words, 'the freedom they have been given is the freedom to engineer a more favourable context for education by taking the most easily educable and excluding the difficult'.</p><p>Academy enthusiasts insist education isn't a zero sum game; in showing how results and behaviour can be improved, they argue, academies establish a path for other schools to follow. Only time will tell whether they have this galvanising effect. As stand-alone schools, though, there doesn't seem to be much incentive for them to share their secrets with others in their area, especially as they are in competition with them for applications. (Mossbourne had 1,400 applications for 180 places last year; a lot of children in Hackney will be going to a school that was their second choice.)</p><p>When I put this concern about divisiveness to Adonis, he says Mossbourne and Hackney are a good example of his contention that academies can lead to a general improvement. Schools across Hackney have become more popular in the past five years: fewer children are leaving the borough for their secondary education, and the three academies that are now up and running (there are two more in development) have played an important part in that. (The other factor has been outsourcing the running of education in the borough to Cambridge Educational Associates, who should probably claim quite a lot of the credit.) 'I think I'm right in saying when I last looked at the statistics,' says Adonis, 'that the perception in Hackney is that secondary education has been transformed and the impact of the academies has been positive.'</p><p>The mistake that the anti-academies lobbyists often make is to treat all academies as if they were the same and, in particular, to imply that they are proto-grammar schools, offering a superior sort of education to a handful of children. What you quickly realise from visiting a few of them is that they are as individual and particular as any other schools. The circumstances they face, though generally difficult, are very different. The question then becomes whether their independence allows them to respond better.</p><p>Unity City Academy in Middlesbrough serves one of the areas of greatest deprivation in Europe: a white working-class area (very different from Mossbourne's multi-ethnic community) where it is now not unusual for families to have seen four generations of unemployment. There is little interest in education: when Ofsted sent out 1,100 questionnaires to Unity parents, it got eight back. More than a third of pupils have special needs, and principal Bob Dore claims many have never seen a beach, although they live only 10 miles from the sea. A substantial proportion have never made it into the town centre. At the age of five, the children on the local estate have the highest rate of fillings in Britain.</p><p>Unlike Mossbourne, Unity City Academy was formed out of two existing schools. The sponsors are Amey plc, project managers in public service; given their background, it is astonishing that the school - which even Adonis admits 'was not a well-managed building project' - is so poorly designed. Only 44 per cent of the building was originally given over to classrooms. The rest, Dore says, 'was for show'. </p><p>For some reason, the building was designed to resemble a Tuscan village - though, actually, you need to be told this. One side of the sports hall backs on to classrooms, which shudder when balls hit its walls; the other adjoins music rooms. There were high and treacherous balconies - very enticing to disaffected or bored pupils, especially ones, as here, with no outside play space. The original dining room was absurdly small. Nor does anything else seem to have been particularly well managed: the school had had three previous heads and was in special measures by the time the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) parachuted in David Triggs, the extremely successful principal of Greensward College in Essex, and now the executive head of five schools.</p><p>Triggs became CEO of Unity, and nine months later brought Dore in as principal. The two men had worked together on preparing two schools to amalgamate into the John Madejski Academy in Reading, and both live in Essex: Dore is a weekly commuter and Triggs works on Unity business three days a month. </p><p>Some of their &pound;6m windfall went on making the building fit for purpose, or fitter - a number of classrooms still have no windows. The rest went on turning a separate block of 17 classrooms into a new East Middlesbrough Technology Centre, which will this week start offering qualifications in hairdressing and beauty, car maintenance, construction, digital media, engineering, catering and horticulture to students from Unity and beyond.</p><p>The term before the new team arrived there were 4,000 exclusion days. The Technology Centre, with its emphasis on vocational education, has been designed to make education more appealing to those who might otherwise fail to see the point of it. The school has also employed dedicated pastoral staff with a background in social services (in some other schools, ex-police officers have filled this role) who go and find children when they don't turn up, and take parents to buy washing machines to keep uniforms clean.</p><p>In the two years since Dore arrived the school has changed a fair bit, although he would say not yet enough. The first thing he and his colleagues did after building a bigger dining hall was teach the children how to queue. There were previously no school trips: last year there were 54, including one to Kenya. The level of crime and the number of Asbos in the area have fallen. Triggs and Dore have permanently excluded three pupils, but 35 who might otherwise have gone are in a special unit down the road, where they don't wear uniform and follow personalised vocational training.</p><p>I talk to three girls who are leaving at 16 to go on to sixth-form college. One of them expects to get 13 good GCSEs and they're all intending to go to university. But they are exceptional. The pupils' scores when they arrive predict that only 17 per cent will have even a 37 per cent chance of getting five A*-Cs at GCSE. Improving results will be a struggle. But at least most pupils are getting out of bed to come in now and parents are gradually becoming interested. </p><p>Some of the anti-academies people like to sneer that schools such as Unity are simply recreating the old secondary moderns. They would, however, probably be the first to argue that education is about more than results. If vocational education offers children an alternative to persistent, apparently hopeless unemployment, then it has to be a good thing. </p><p>None of what Unity is doing is unique. Like other academies, and indeed other well-led schools, it cherry-picks good ideas from elsewhere. I ask Dore what it is about being an academy, aside from the &pound;6m, that has allowed him to get as far as he has, and he doesn't really have an answer. 'It would have taken much longer at a local authority school,' he says. 'There would have been a lot of forms to fill in.'</p><p>In fact, reading between the lines, the sponsors here seem to have been of limited help. They commissioned an unsuitable building and couldn't keep a head teacher. When Triggs was brought in by the DCSF, the Amey-appointed board of governors was also changed. Three Amey staff members, of whom Dore speaks highly, continued to represent the company, although when I visited the school one of them had left Amey and his place on the governing board had not yet been filled. This looks, at best, rather offhand. (No one from Amey would speak to me directly, although a month after I initially approached the company, the managing director supplied a rather general statement which spoke of 'challenges', 'four years of continuous improvements' and 'confidence in the board's ability to build on this good work', but didn't answer the key points about the terrible building, the succession of heads, or the delay in filling the board vacancy.)</p><p>The funding agreement between a sponsor and the DCSF is a seven-year rolling contract which could in theory be terminated at any time. But David Wolfe, a barrister at Matrix Chambers and an expert on academies, says the grounds for doing this are very limited. A sponsor couldn't, for example, be removed if an academy failed to meet Ed Balls's National Challenge of getting at least 30 per cent of pupils five A*-C GCSEs, including English and maths.</p><p>Sponsors are also a cause for concern insofar as they can dictate the curriculum. There have been persistent worries that evangelical Christians like Sir Peter Vardy, with his Emmanuel Schools Trust (three schools in the north of England), or Robert Edmiston, with one academy open and another in development in the Midlands, have too much control over what is taught and, in particular, that they promote creationism. The Royal Society was concerned enough about the Emmanuel Schools Trust to issue a rare protest. 'Creationism,' it pointed out crisply, 'is not consistent with the wealth of evidence for evolution, such as the fossil record. Similarly, a belief that the Earth was formed in 4004BC is not consistent with the evidence from geology, astronomy and physics.' </p><p>Gordon Brown and Ed Balls have now changed the rules to require academies to follow the national curriculum in the core subjects of maths, English and science. Adonis says independent control of the curriculum is in practice an ability to add on rather than reduce, and dismisses anxieties about the teaching of creationism: 'Ofsted has not found concerns about the teaching of science. The schools which have been most criticised by fundamentalist secularists have without exception been praised for the quality of education they are offering. And parents are queueing up to send their children to those schools.'</p><p>So how do the rest of the charges against academies stand up? Alasdair Smith of the Anti Academies Alliance objects that they lack democratic accountability. This is fair enough, but it's doubtful that many parents feel they have any democratic control over non-academy schools. Governors' meetings at council-run schools are often bogged down in bureaucracy, while local representation can mean little more than activists playing out politics at the level of the school. The objection also misses the point that academies usually replace local authority schools that were struggling and unpopular. </p><p>The programme does, though, seem to be intellectually inconsistent: if independence is so marvellous, why not give it to all schools? Adonis's response is that that's where he's heading: he envisages all 3,500 secondary schools 'moving towards greater autonomy and greater engagement with external partners ... The academies are at the leading edge of a trend that's been spreading across the whole state system. What do I expect to see happen? Progressively more schools having progressively more independence, and local authorities increasingly becoming commissioners of education, rather than providers.'</p><p>As far as exclusions are concerned, academy principals claim that the figures are skewed by the difficulties of amalgamating schools, but are not out of line with what might be expected in the first year, and that they quickly settle down. It remains to be seen whether the numbers do indeed settle. Much else about academies will also only be clear after some time. Thomas Deacon Academy, for example, has been formed from three schools, one of which - Deacon's - was highly desirable, while the others were less successful. Some 50 per cent of the pupils came from Deacon's and inevitably their dominance has affected the atmosphere. The new academy doesn't, for example, play football, because Deacon's had a fixture list against public schools and that, the director of sport says, grandly, 'lends itself to rugby and hockey'.</p><p>I am shown around by sixth-formers who enthuse about their International Baccalaureate courses, their spanking new building, the enormous numbers of computers, the amount of information that now comes to them by email, the extent of student representation and the range of activities on offer once school officially finishes at 2.30pm. They are charming, articulate and thoughtful. It turns out that they were all previously at Deacon's. Perhaps it will only be fair to judge the new academy when it's educating children from 11 to 18.</p><p>The only reasonable conclusion to draw from looking at a range of academies is that they're not homogeneous. They are affected by variables common to all schools - the quality of the management, the attitude and ability of the pupils and teachers - and by other things that don't apply elsewhere, like the involvement of their sponsor. At the moment, they are benefiting from new buildings and the feelings of specialness that the infrastructural investment implies. But the buildings won't be cutting-edge forever. Anyway, it is possible to have a brilliantly run school in scruffy buildings and a badly run one in a celebrity architect's dream. Relationships matter much more.</p><p>Some local authority schools have done radical things, such as setting up computers in thousands of pupils' homes, without troubling themselves to become academies. Taking on academy status may well allow heads and governors to move faster. Is that likely to have an adverse effect on other schools in the vicinity? Unless you think there is only so much success to go around (in which case you might as well give up on the education of all but a few) there's no necessity for it to do so, especially if academies are open about the secrets of their success. But the omens are not good: Britain has a grim history of divisiveness in education. </p><p>The government, it seems, sees academies partly as a means of jolting schools out of a torpid culture in which failure has become acceptable. 'It is an almost invariable rule,' Adonis tells me, 'that the greater the controversy over the setting up of an academy the more popular it is when it opens. That doesn't surprise me, because controversies are often driven by very strong local vested interests, and they tend to exist where educational standards are lowest and there's most to fear from the arrival of an academy.'</p><p>There are many dedicated and innovative teachers outside academies, and academies are far from being a universal panacea. To be really good they need, like any school, to offer inspiring leadership, to be efficiently managed, and to pay very close attention to all their pupils. Academy status can't guarantee those things, although it may make them more likely, not least because the government has too much at stake to let any academies fail. Adonis and Ed Balls cannot, though, be expected to pay the attention that the early academies have had to all 3,500 secondary schools, let alone the primary schools now increasingly being talked about as candidates for independence, perhaps as part of all-through academies. Sponsors - universities and federations of branded schools in particular - will become even more important. The message may well be to pick your sponsor carefully.</p><p>In the end, the positions of the pro- and anti-academy lobbyists were summed up for me by two teachers. The first, Carmel Totman, is an English teacher at Mossbourne. 'I have a lot of arguments with teacher friends about the fact I work here,' she says. 'They say it's elitist. But we take children of all backgrounds and abilities and have very high expectations of them. We don't make excuses on the basis of background or culture.'  </p><p>The other was David York, branch secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers and an organiser of the anti-academy protest in Barrow-in-Furness. I asked him whether he thought an academy might not boost the results of the children who currently attend the least successful school in the town. 'You have to ask yourself why some children aren't getting five A*-Cs at GCSE,' he said. 'Some are just not capable of doing that.' Regardless of who I was, or where I came from, I know who I'd rather have teaching my kids.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/08/30/acain140x84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/31/secondaryschools.schools","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2008/aug/31/secondaryschools.schools","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Full text of Barack Obama's acceptance of the Democratic nomination for president","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-29T04:08:44Z","sectionId":"us-news","id":"world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2","fields":{"body":"<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337065388\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1760479111_gdn-int-080829-cb-US-Obama-Speech-4x3.flv\"></source>\n      </video><p>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;</p><p>With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.</p><p>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours - Hillary Rodham Clinton. To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.</p><p>To the love of my life, our next first lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.</p><p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p><p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generationcan pursue their dreams as well.</p><p>That's why I stand here tonight. Because for 232 years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors - found the courage to keep it alive.</p><p>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p><p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay and tuition that's beyond your reach.</p><p>These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush.</p><p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p><p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p><p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for 20 years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p><p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p><p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\"</p><p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p><p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90% of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than 90% of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10% chance on change.</p><p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on healthcare and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this president.  He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisers - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners\".</p><p>A nation of whiners?  Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p><p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle class as someone making under $5m a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a healthcare plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatise social security and gamble your retirement?</p><p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p><p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No healthcare? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots.  You're on your own.</p><p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p><p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p><p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.  We measure progress in the 23m new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p><p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.</p><p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p><p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p><p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p><p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the south side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p><p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p><p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the United States.</p><p>What is that promise?</p><p>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p><p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p><p>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</p><p>Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p><p>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p><p>That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now.  So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am president.</p><p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p><p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p><p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p><p>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families.  Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</p><p>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as president: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p><p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years, and John McCain has been there for 26 of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p><p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p><p>As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest $150bn dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and 5m new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p><p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p><p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p><p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible healthcare for every single American. If you have healthcare, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p><p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p><p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect social security for future generations.</p><p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p><p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet 21st-century challenges with a 20th-century bureaucracy.</p><p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength\". Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programmes alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p><p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.</p><p>And just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next commander-in-chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p><p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p><p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79bn surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p><p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a president who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p><p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.</p><p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans - Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p><p>As commander-in-chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p><p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.  I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future.</p><p>These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p><p>But what I will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p><p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.</p><p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p><p>America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore.</p><p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the second amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort.</p><p>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.</p><p>You make a big election about small things.</p><p>And you know what - it's worked before. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.</p><p>I get it. I realise that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.</p><p>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me. It's been about you.</p><p>For 18 long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington. Change comes to Washington. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.</p><p>America, this is one of those moments.</p><p>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming. Because I've seen it. Because I've lived it. I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided healthcare to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.  I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.</p><p>And I've seen it in this campaign. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did. I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbours who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.</p><p>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.</p><p>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.</p><p>That promise is our greatest inheritance. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.</p><p>And it is that promise that 45 years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in Washington, before Lincoln's memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p><p>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. They could've heard words of anger and discord. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p><p>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and colour, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.</p><p>\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried. \"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\"</p><p>America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back.  We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p><p>Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/29/barry140x84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama2","sectionName":"US news"},{"webTitle":"Oliver Burkeman's Campaign Diary: Advance text of Obama's speech","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-29T01:29:13Z","sectionId":"us-news","id":"world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/1","fields":{"body":"<p>[I'm liveblogging tonight's events <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama\">here</a>.]</p><p>[I've replaced the excerpts that were here previously with the full advance text]</p><p>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;</p><p>With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.</p><p>.</p><p>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest \u0013 a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton. To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you. I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night.</p><p>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia \u0013 I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.</p><p>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story \u0013 of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.</p><p>It is that promise that has always set this country apart \u0013 that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.</p><p>That's why I stand here tonight. Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women \u0013 students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.</p><p>We meet at one of those defining moments \u0013 a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.</p><p>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.</p><p>These challenges are not all of government's making. But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.</p><p>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</p><p>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.</p><p>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.</p><p>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.</p><p>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land \u0013 enough! This moment \u0013 this election \u0013 is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\"</p><p>Now let there be no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect. And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.</p><p>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.</p><p>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives \u0013 on health care and education and the economy \u0013 Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He said that our economy has made \"great progress\" under this President. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisors \u0013 the man who wrote his economic plan \u0013 was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a \"mental recession,\" and that we've become, and I quote, \"a nation of whiners.\"</p><p>A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint. These are the Americans that I know.</p><p>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?</p><p>It's not because John McCain doesn't care. It's because John McCain doesn't get it.</p><p>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy \u0013 give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is \u0013 you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck. No health care? The market will fix it. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps \u0013 even if you don't have boots. You're on your own.</p><p>Well it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America.</p><p>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p><p>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President \u0013 when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.</p><p>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job \u0013 an economy that honors the dignity of work.</p><p>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great \u0013 a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.</p><p>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.</p><p>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.</p><p>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.</p><p>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.</p><p>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes. Theirs are the stories that shaped me. And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States.</p><p>What is that promise?</p><p>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p><p>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.</p><p>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves \u0013 protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.</p><p>Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.</p><p>That's the promise of America \u0013 the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.</p><p>That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President.</p><p>.</p><p>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.</p><p>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.</p><p>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.</p><p>I will cut taxes \u0013 cut taxes \u0013 for 95% of all working families. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.</p><p>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East.</p><p>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them. In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.</p><p>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close.</p><p>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy \u0013 wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.</p><p>America, now is not the time for small plans.</p><p>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American \u0013 if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.</p><p>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.</p><p>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.</p><p>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.</p><p>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.</p><p>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime \u0013 by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less \u0013 because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.</p><p>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our \"intellectual and moral strength.\" Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.</p><p>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility \u0013 that's the essence of America's promise.</p><p>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.</p><p>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face. When John McCain said we could just \"muddle through\" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell \u0013 but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.</p><p>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.</p><p>That's not the judgment we need. That won't keep America safe. We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.</p><p>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice \u0013 but it is not the change we need.</p><p>We are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans \u0013 have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.</p><p>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.</p><p>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.</p><p>These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.</p><p>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.</p><p>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a Red America or a Blue America \u0013 they have served the United States of America.</p><p>So I've got news for you, John McCain. We all put our country first.</p><p>America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose \u0013 our sense of higher purpose. And that's what we have to restore.</p><p>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.

It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours \u0013 a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.</p><p>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.</p><p>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.

They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.</p><p>But what the people heard instead \u0013 people of every creed and color, from every walk of life \u0013 is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked. That together, our dreams can be one.</p><p>\"We cannot walk alone,\" the preacher cried. \"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.\"</p><p>America, we cannot turn back. Not with so much work to be done. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend. America, we cannot turn back. We cannot walk alone. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Let us keep that promise \u0013 that American promise \u0013 and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.</p><p>Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.</p><p>[<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/uselections2008.barackobama\">Go back</a> to the liveblog]</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/29/1","sectionName":"US news"},{"webTitle":"Olympics: day 16 - live!","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-24T00:12:51Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/2008/aug/24/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3","fields":{"body":"<!-- Block 57 --><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYCEnVmNkpE\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYCEnVmNkpE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>8.10am: Basketball:</strong> Back-to-back three pointers from USA, including one from <em>way</em> downtown from LeBron James, gives USA a 14-point lead. Spain's Rudy Fernandez gets two back and then nails a huge three-pointer. Nothing but net; nothing but net.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>8.07am: </strong>What else is popular on the internet? (Except that.) Anyone got anything to sell? Poker anyone? YouTube clips? File-sharing? We've got a lot of space and a lot of time to fill it. It's 52-42 with five minutes left in the second quarter, incidentally.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>8.03am: Basketball: </strong>Some Globetrottering from Kobe Bryant, who gives the USA a 10-point lead with a near-ally-oop. Then some textbook diva behaviour from Dwight Howard, whose foul gives two free shots to Spain. They miss them both.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>8am: Basketball:</strong> Anyone interested in this mismatch? USA have gone 46-33 up against Spain in the second quarter, although a late comeback from Their Egos could prove the toughest opponents. Oh, it's 46-38 now.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>7.54am:</strong> I understand this morning's riff is on best Olympic performances, heroic and otherwise, and here's Gary Naylor to stir it up. He rates Bolt over Phelps, which is like saying salt and vinegar over cheese and onion, or the other way round. Here's how he justifies it: \"Fairly or not, we're used to multiple medal winning in the pool, so Bolt's series of performances on the biggest stage stand, like him, head and shoulders over everything else, including Phelps.\" </p><p>And at the other end, here's more Naylor: \"Elsewhere, Lolo Jones missed a certain gold when hitting the penultimate high hurdle. She stumbled to the finish line, distraught, and then showed great composure in her interviews, acknowledging her rivals' success and her own failure. She didn't get a lot of attention, but she didn't fit the media stereotype of the Team USA sprinter, so they couldn't be bothered reporting her.\"</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>7.52am: </strong>Good morning again, sniff, for the final time. I'm going to miss crawling into work in the early hours of the weekend mornings, sharing the streets with stragglers from the London booze and drug scene, to find handball on the telly and a bunch of weirdos in my inbox.</p><p>But please stay with me for one more day, weirdos. It's a pretty light morning on competition in Beijing, so we're going to need some of your emails. Before you get too excited, I'm not fielding anything about the GB/Autralia non-competition. Aussies: you got fewer medals (gold and total) than the Brits and I don't care how sizeable your population relative to Britain's. And Brits, let's just let it lie already, OK. By all means take to the streets of Brisbane with your gloating, but leave it out here, all right.</p><p>So, in the absence of that, what have we left? Well, there's the <strong>American basketball team</strong> on the court in the gold medal match: they're 22-22 against Spain in the first quarter as I type. I know some of the Americans -- <strong>Kobe</strong>, <strong>LeBron</strong>, <strong>Carmelo</strong>, they're all my bros; I know none of the Spanish, and for this reason I'm supporting the NBA divas and the wannabes.</p><p>Later on, there's the <strong>closing ceremony</strong> and the main event - Britain's 10-minute presentation as the Olympic mantle officially transfers to London. That's going to be a spectacular shambles and I can't wait. I fully expect it'll only be necessary to describe in the plainest of terms what's happening on the screen and it'll be a comedy masterpiece; no embellishment necessary.</p><p>That won't be for another few hours yet, so back to the basketball. It's 33-27 to USA.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>7.37am: </strong> The <strong>men's basketball gold medal match</strong> has just tipped-off. So there's no better time to hand you over to Howard Swains. Wow, that's it from me. See you in four years.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>7.28am: </strong>All those clips below are from past Olympics. So here are my top-five (admittedly Brit-focused) moments from Beijing 2008. In no particular order:</p><p>1) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.rowing\">GB's women's quadruple sculls are beaten into second place</a>, cue a John Inverdale interview with tears and wry smiles.<br/>2) Christine Ohuruogu looks down and out after the first half of the women's 400m. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/19/christineohuruogu.olympicsathletics\">But Sanya Richards tires, and the rest, as they say, is history</a>.<br/>3) Sport and politics are always destined to mix. So with conflict between the two countries raging, Russia took on Georgia (well two Brazilians really) in the women's beach volleyball. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics2008.olympicsvolleyball?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=sport\">And Georgia came out on top</a>.<br/>4) On paper it sounds boring, but the 10km swim is actually quite compelling. David Davies seemed to have it all wrapped up, but then he started swimming in the wrong direction. Eventually cancer survivor Maarten van der Weijden came through to take gold, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/21/swimming.britisholympicteam\">but Davies fought delirium to hang on for silver</a>.<br/>5) I suppose it's a tie between <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics\">Michael Phelps' remarkable achievement</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/17/olympicsathletics.olympics2008\">Usain Bolt's</a> startling brilliance. Both utterly amazing, in their own separate way.<br/>Agree, disagree? Let me know.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>7.09am: </strong>It's all over. I told you...GOLD FOR USA. Stanley is the man. What a final, way better than the football yesterday.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>7.07am: </strong>One match point saved by Brazil.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>7.06am: </strong>This volleyball malarkey isn't half bad. USA are on the verge of a shock victory. Brazil have gone to pieces.</p><!-- Block 45 --><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zi0_LjHHN4\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zi0_LjHHN4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p><strong>6.58am: </strong>Actually, this is it. I mentioned it earlier, and it is well-known, but it always sets my bottom lip aquiver.</p><!-- Block 44 --><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqi2bT_TqDs\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pqi2bT_TqDs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p><strong>6.51am: </strong>Permit me some self-indulgence readers. Above is one of my favourite Olympic moments. What are yours?</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>6.47am: </strong> The basketball bronze medal match is over, and argentina have the bronze. They beat Lithuania 87-75.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>6.44am: </strong>China have won another medal, Zou Shiming has claimed gold in the light-flyweight boxing.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>6.40am: </strong> If you're not as gripped with the volleyball as I am, Spain are taking on Croatia for the <strong>handball bronze medal</strong>. Plus there are a host of boxing finals going on, if you want some fist-flailing action.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>6.35am: </strong><strong>Volleyball </strong>Tactically the USA are playing this just right. They've now gone 2-1 up against the much fancied Brazilians.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>6.10am: </strong>Jeanne Perrett wants to know what time the closing ceremony starts. Well Jeanne, I'm here to serve. The festivities kick-off at 1300 BST or 2000 Beijing time. Apparently you can look forward to three hours of \"action\".</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>6.08am: </strong>U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A, My boys have leveled things up; it's one set apiece in the <strong>volleyball.</strong></p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>6.05am: </strong>Over on the <strong>basketball</strong> court Argentina are currently beating Lithuania 57-39 in the bronze medal match. hopefully it's whetting your appetite for the main course of the USA v Spain.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>5.58am: </strong>I make no apologies for missing the result of the rhythmic gymnastics all-around group competition. Apparently Russia took gold with a totally arbitrary score of 35.550. China were second and Belarus took the bronze. I, for one, can't wait 'til next time.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>5.50am: </strong>As i predicted the USA are fighting back in the <strong>volleyball</strong>. They lead 17-14 in the second set.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>5.28am: </strong>Pommie Barsteward has added to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics20082\">the 100 things that they have learned in Beijing</a>. He proposes two new entries. <br/>101. <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/24/2344788.htm?site=olympics/2008\">Aussie gold medals cost the tax payer $16.7m each</a>. <br/><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/24/2344844.htm?site=olympics/2008\">102. And Aussies aren't the world's most gracious losers</a>.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>5.20am: </strong>The Olympics is all about tear jerking tales (watch Derek Redmond hobbling down the finishing straight and I defy you not to blub). Anyway Josh in Cambodia has this to say (I'm not even going to edit it): \"I live in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, a country with 4 Olympians. Their most promising athlete is a marathon runner, Hem Bunting, who got a silver medal in the Asian games last year. Anyway, I don't know how he did today (remarkably tough to find out on the Olympics website), but the guy has no funding, can't afford to buy training shoes, and is sometimes even locked out of the Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh where he trains. He therefore trains by running around Phnom Penh, breathing diesel fumes and risking death by motorcycle.\" So if there are any representatives from large multinational sports corporations reading this, how about throwing some money his way!?</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>5.17am: </strong><strong>GB&amp;NI news</strong> Chris Hoy has been confirmed as the Great Britain flag bearer for the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>5.10am: </strong>USA player Lloy Ball is a massive Rage Against the Machine fan apparently. He really should have been at Reading Festival on Friday instead of galavanting  around at the Olympics.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>5.02am: </strong>Finally I've found out why there's one guy on each team with a different coloured shirt. I always assumed it was some kind of fashion statement. But it's because they are the 'libero', the ball control specialist. 4-1 to Brazil by the way</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>4.57am: </strong>Right is everyone rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrready for the men's gold medal match in the volleyball. It's a heavyweight clash: USA v Brazil. I'm excited. In the style of Two-Face I've flicked a coin and I can reveal that the USA are going to win. U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>4.46am: </strong>Oliver Pattenden sheds some light on why people may not be reading: \"Team GB is up for sod all today, so we're saving ourselves for the pageant of Britishness later on.\" <em>I'm cringing already at the thought of all the old clichés being wheeled out. However, it will be nice that Bozza Johnson will be there to show the world that nothing much has changed since GB last held the Olympics in 1948. </em></p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>4.32am: </strong><strong>READERS WHERE ARE YOU!?</strong> I need your witty, irreverent banter to help me through these awkward hours of non-sport. It's your last chance. After today I'll be disappearing into the ether never to be seen again.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>4.30am: </strong>I'm sorry, but I can't get into this rhythmic gymnastics guff. It's like one of those pretentious live art installations - boring, boring, boring. I wish there was some handball on, now that's a sport.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>4.26am: </strong>They think it's all over...it is now. Russia have claimed the bronze medal in the <strong>men's volleyball</strong>. Beating Italy 3-0.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>4.25am: </strong>Here's something I don't understand, why are sports like rhythmic gymnastics and synchronised swimming in the Olympics when cricket, golf and rugby not? Absolute nonsense if you ask me, oh and don't get me started on baseball and softball. Plus if you're going to have archery, you've got to allow darts. I'm sure you're all bored by these anglocentric arguments, but I'm getting quite emotional as end draws near.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p>4.20am: Right, where are we. Russia are two sets and 20-18 up over Italy in the <strong>men's bronze medal volleyball match</strong>. And as I promised, over in the Beijing University of Technology Gymnasium, there's some rather delightful choreography going on in the <strong>rhythmic gymnastics</strong>.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>4.11am: </strong>It's just after 4am, time for some subtle plugging. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/24/olympics2008.olympicsathletics\">Anna Kessel interviews Usain Bolt</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/24/games_for_all_as_britain_shine.html\">Kevin Mitchell blogs about the Games' unsung heroes</a> and our writers reveal <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics20082\">the 100 things that they have learned in Beijing</a>.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>3.45am: </strong> According to Pommie Barsteward in Queensland: \"Kate Ellis, the Aussie sports minister, has been consuming vast quantities of humble pie on Aussie TV this morning. You may recall she had a bet with her UK counterpart before the Games regarding which nation would be placed highest in the medal table and, as she's on the losing end of the wager, she now has to wear a GB-related t-shirt at her next media appearance. Maybe some MBM readers would like to contribute some suitable design suggestions for the aforementioned apparel?\"</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>3.42am: </strong>Shamini in Singapore has not been fully convinced by the Beijing Games: \"There's been too much sanctioned cheating and silly events - but Phelps and even more so Bolt have elevated sport to a new level - Bolt has restored my faith in the pure undiluted brilliance of the human spirit!\"</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>3.35am: </strong> One way traffic in the <strong>volleyball</strong>. Russia are one set up and leading 8-1 in the second.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>3.18am: </strong> Greg in Margaret River, Australia (which, by the way I've heard is a lovely place) reckons the Guardian's medal table is short changing our cousin over in Oz. Well, I did say we hadn't deliberately altered the USA's total, but I can't be so sure about Australia's. After all us Brits have had to endure years of sporting torment at the hands of the Wallabies. Maybe we'll let you win the Ashes next year to make you feel better.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>3.10am: </strong>So it appears that the real leader of Great Britain, David Beckham, is going to play a prominent role in the closing ceremony. \"It's going to be very different from the opening ceremony, which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show Chinese culture to the world,\" one of the directors, Miao Pei, told China's Southern Metropolis News.  Mind you I'd rather see Becks over in Beijing playing the diplomat than clogging up England's right side with his one-dimensional punting.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>3.07am: </strong> Right now that the marathon has been sorted out, there's some <strong>men's volleyball</strong> medals up for grabs. Russia take on Italy in the bronze medal match. It's currently 8-4 to Russia. Can they hang on? I have no idea.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>2.55am: </strong>Dan Robinson finishes 24th with a time of just over 2 hours 16 minutes. 24th may not sound great, but in the conditions it was a truly monumental effort.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>2.46am: </strong>Brendon Foster has added some much needed doom and gloom to the proceedings, pointing out that no British male distance runners have finished in the top eight for the first time since 1896. Good one Brendon, there's been way too much unadulterated joy for my liking too.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>2.44am: </strong>Merga looks absolutely knackered, as team-mate Kebede overtakes him to grab the bronze medal. Fourth place is the cruelest position. London Marathon winner Martin Lel finishes fifth.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>2.40am: </strong><strong>Marathon </strong>Samuel Wanjiru is greeted by thousands of fans in the Bird's Nest Stadium. He's run a great race, outlasting all the rest. It's GOLD for Kenya in a new Olympic record time. Gharib of Morocco gets the silver.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>2.35am: </strong>Tony Jarrett (possibly the famous hurdler, who knows) says: \"It has been really great to see so many Union Jacks waved by happy, often triumphant people, without listening to hatred and abuse of other countries.\"</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>2.30am: </strong>Back to the <strong>marathon</strong>. Wanjiru is sweating profusely as he makes a break. The gold medal is now his to lose.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>2.23am: </strong>Oh dear more 'issues' with the medal table Stephen Vaughn says: \"Could you please explain why the Guardian's medal count shows 103 medals for the United States, rather than the 107 that the U.S. has actually won? Are you docking us 4 medals for George W. Bush?\"<br/><em>I can assure you Stephen that it's not Guardian policy to alter results according to political leanings. Although if Obama was incharge.....</em></p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>2.18am: </strong>Having only just got into the office, I'm shocked to see the Russians have leap frogged GB&amp;NI. Well it was good while it lasted.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>2.10am: </strong>In the <strong>marathon</strong> it looks like we're down to three. Deriba Merga, Samuel Kamau Wanjiru and Jaouad Gharib will duke it out for gold, silver and bronze.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>2.02am: </strong>Don't you just love how sport gives politicians the opportunity to spout off. Scottish Sports minister Stewart Maxwell says that Scotland should compete in its own right at the 2012 Olympics and not as part of Team GB. \"\"This is an exceptionally brilliant nation - at the same time a small nation. Scotland can compete on the world stage - we proved that in the Olympics - and a Scottish team at the Olympics is the future,\" he said.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>2.00am: </strong><strong>Marathon </strong> drama. The relentless pace has forced out Luke Kibet. This is all getting a bit ridiculous now, Martin Lel is even struggling.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>1.55am: </strong>If we're to believe all the hyperbole this has been the greatest Olympics ever. Spitz's medal haul was smashed and Michael Johnson now looks like a Sunday morning jogger when compared to the Lightning Bolt. But has it really been that great? How many times have the hairs on the back of your neck stood up or tears flowed down your face? Let me know.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>1.50am: </strong>\"But what else is happening?\", I hear you ask. Well on my watch you can look forward to medal matches in <strong>men's basketball</strong>, <strong>men's water polo</strong>, <strong>men's handball</strong> and <strong>men's volleyball</strong>. Plus they'll be some prancing and dancing in the <strong>rhythmic gymnastics</strong>.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>1.44am: </strong>Morning all. Well it's the final day of competition and what better way to kick it off than the most grueling event of all - the marathon. On the BBC Crammy can't believe what his Mackem eyes are telling him, the leading five athletes are setting a blistering pace. Surely they won't be able to keep it up!?</p><!-- Block 1 --><p>Patrick will be at 1.40am</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/24/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2008/aug/24/olympics2008.olympicsathletics3","sectionName":"Sport"},{"webTitle":"Olympics: day 15 - as it happened","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-23T00:48:06Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.britisholympicteam2","fields":{"body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p>Alan will be here from 2.00am...</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Like a bumper sack of Christmas presents, Beijing has held us rapt for the best part of a fortnight now, but there's still some fun to be had at the 29th Olympiad. <strong>Wee Tom Daley</strong> will be showcasing the talent that British football missed out on in the diving; <strong>the good doctor Tim Brabants</strong> is off in the kayaking at 8.30am - prescription: more gold; there'll be a further chances to cover ourselves in relay glory with some <strong>4x400m baton juggling for both the men and the women</strong> in the Bird's Nest; and <strong>Lisa Dobriskey</strong> will attempt to add to <strong>Team GB's pot o'gold</strong> in the 1500m.

I know, you're on tenter hoo... yada, yada.</p><p>Still, handball, eh.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>2.15am:</strong> It's 1-1 in that crucial fight for 11th place in the hockey. China and South Africa are scrapping for the honour of finishing bottom and not-bottom. I'm not really sure about the handball, other than that Sweden and Romania are the nations doing the handling...</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>2.25am:</strong> Huzzahs! We've got some yelpin' 'n' kickin' over in the Beijing Science and Technology University Gymnasium (BSaTUG). Malaysia's Chew Chan Che has just bashed seven bells out of Uzbekistan's Evgeniya Karimova in the Taekwondo women's 67kg preliminary. The BSaTUG crowd loved that.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>2.30am:</strong> Thirty-two medals up for vending today, the second busiest of the Games. Not that you'd know it right now. Ecuador - Australia up next in kick-scream-dance-fall over. Taekwondo combatants look a bit like rappers about go head to head in a battle, to me, bouncing back and forth on the balls of their feet before ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK. Gangsta rap's probably less violent though.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>2.37am: Word from our BBC spies.</strong> \"The Beeb reports that the 'pageant of Britishness' we will be treated to tomorrow is set to feature none other than a Privet Hedge!\" says 'Grey Squirrel' Oliver Pattenden. \"What more appropriate way is there to welcome the entire world to enjoy our culture, than to present them with the staunchly vigilant and rather stoic shrub we employ to tell everyone else to mind their own business.\" Yes, a shrubbery, that's what we want. Will there be some curtain-twitching too? And maybe some lessons on the Empire - may its sun never set...</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>2.43am:</strong> The Taekwondo-ers (proper name, anyone?) are stalking each other like two ginormous, springy preying mantises (manti?). Aus have kicked ass, and the victorious girl is being led off by an attendant with a flag, presumably to her quarter-final fate. Cue some cheesy Europap in the stadium...</p><p>Brazil v Greece next.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>2.50am:</strong> Has anyone else noticed the egregious use of ear-bleed dance music in the various stadia in Beijing? It's as if the organisers got sent a crate load of Sash, DJ Otzi, et al, and told \"this is what Westerners like...\" 0-0 after the first round in the Taekwondo.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>2.53am: Wee Tom Daley's off in the Water Cube soon</strong>, although even he doesn't rate his chances: \"I don't think I'll get anywhere near a medal.\" Glad I'm up for this then. Moments of the Games, people? Daley throwing the evil eye Blake Aldridge's way after their synchronised bombing...?</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>2.58am:</strong> It's bright and sunny in the 'jing as Clare Balding kicks of the Beeb's coverage for the morning. \"If Taekwondo were a movie, it would be called 'Carry On Screaming'.\" Arf, arf. <strong>Team GB's Sarah Stevenson</strong> is your one to cheer for today. And, with all the fuss about Wee Tom Daley, I forgot to mention that <strong>Pete Waterfield actually qualified 4th for the diving semis</strong>... so maybe he is worth staying up for.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>3.03am:</strong> Daley says \"Brilliant!\" more often than the character called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/fastshow/characters/brilliant.shtml\">Brilliant from the Fast Show</a>. And Leon 'Holy Moly' Taylor - Waterfield medal-winning partner from Athens - has got a mic in his hand and, unfortunately, he's not afraid to use it.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>3.06am:</strong> I'll be relying on the steady hand of Bob Ballard to guide us through this, because I have absolutely no idea what the jings is going on - and Taylor is about as helpful as brail.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>3.11am:</strong> Now that's a question: commentator of the Games? Hugh Porter from the cycling? Gary Richardson for his stalwart interviewing/interrogating? Jackson and Johnson doubling teaming - in a nice, clean way - up in the athletics tower? This is one that could rumble on and on... (MBMer plants riff, shuts his eyes, and hopes it will grow)</p><p><strong>Team GB</strong> Tom Daley has just flipped his way into the pool like a young Jimminy Cricket to score 71.40 for his first dive.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>3.15am: Team GB</strong> Pete Waterfield's abs have just chucked themselves off the board. \"That's the best three and a half pike we've seen,\" gurgles Taylor. Three nines give Waterfield 81 points and second place... until some Russian geezer gets 88 one jump later and leapfrogs his way to the top.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>3.20am:</strong> Daley's in 15th, but there are five rounds still to go. Taylor reckons seventies won't cut it, though. Even if you \"look like an angel and dive like a swallow\". Not my words, Clare Balding's. Excuse me while I scratch my head for some time.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>3.23am:</strong> My tip here is to look for the splash on entry into the water (I lied earlier when I said I knew nothing - this is \"Britain's most popular newspaper website\"* after all). The bigger the splash, the lower the score. But then, as you're reading about the diving, rather than watching it, I guess such pithy wisdom is wasted on you. Gah.</p><p>*copyright: Big Paper</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>3.25am:</strong> A Belorussian nearly brains himself on the platform as he dives, and then Daley's up again. And I have to retract my mocking of Balding (surely not in the running in our broadcaster awards - nudge, nudge), because that was certainly swallow-like. Only 3.0 difficulty though, so those eights are only worth 72 to Wee Tom.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>3.30am:</strong> More sage advice for the ingenu diving-watcher: you don't want to get a bit \"banana man\" when you hit the water, says Taylor. Bending = bad, then. But if you throw up \"naff all\" splash, like the Chinese diver just did, then you're doing alright. See, solid Rebranded Website advice backed up by Chief Diving Wonk, Leon Taylor.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>3.33am: Team GB</strong> Wakefield, whose abs you could probably play skiffle on, is suffering with injections in his shoulder, but he manages a hand-stand before plunging pool-ward. Not so point-worthy this time - just 72 for Abs Waterfield.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>3.35am:</strong> Predictably the Chinese are first and second. Abs is 9th with Wee Tom down in 16th. Only the top twelve go through to the final later today.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>3.40am:</strong> Venezuala are getting another kicking over in the Taekwondo. <strong>Team GB's Stevenson</strong> will be getting her yell on in about 10 minutes. Plenty of splish-splosh back at the diving, with a Canadian athlete whirring like a Roman candle on his way down. The suicidal Belorussian makes too much splosh this time, so no big score for him.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>3.43am: Wee Tom goes with 3.2 difficulty this time...</strong> and it's good, coos Taylor. Apparently, even though Wee Tom didn't hit the water quite vertical, he used his skill to keep the splash down. What a champ.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>3.46am:</strong> China's Huo Liang is that good that Taylor's forced to bring out his chuckle. This kid is running away with it - and we're only in the semi.</p><p><strong>Sarah Stevenson, Britain's best-known Taekwondo athlete</strong> - truly some distinction - has trooped out onto the mat. She has a tough draw against Jordan's Nadin Dawani, though.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>3.50am: Team GB</strong> Waterfield notches a solid 70. He should be good for the final at this rate. Stevenson slaps a foot into the Jordanian, and she's 2-1 up after round one. She's been given one of those half penalty points though.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>3.51am:</strong> Having said that, Waterfield is only 12th... and he's keeping Wee Tom, who's 13th, out of the final currently.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>3.54am: Jingoism jingle.</strong> \"I'm sure when I went to bed at close of business last night the GB Super Team had just been overtaken in the medal table by those uber-scary, dark and menacing Ruskies,\" Jerusalems David Lloyd from Beijing. \"It's odd that 2 weeks ago we'd all have given anything to be doing as well as are now, and yet I now find myself even more urgently refreshing the Guardian blog just to ensure that we remain in 3rd ahead of those troublesome, lesser little sporting nations such as Russia. Anyway, any idea where this 18th Gold of ours suddenly materialise from?\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">This</a> should suffice, David.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>3.59am: Team GB</strong> Don't worry, those Russians have got no chance. \"Phenome-Tom\" has just bashed 86.40 out in the diving, and Sarah Stevenson has scrapped her way into the next round of the 67kg Taekwondo. TEAM GB! TEAM GB! TEAM GB!</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>4.03am:</strong> It certainly is noticeable how expectations have changed in the last week. As we've crept up the table, we've become less and less concerned with putting in a good effort, and more about beating those Aussie/Ruskie/German b*stards just below. In the interests of managing expectations, though, I should point out that Sarah Stevenson's reward for yelling louder than her opponent in the Taekwondo is a shout-off against the reigning Olympic champion.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>4.05am: Team GB diving</strong> Waterfield nails his effort as well, picking up a cool 90 points. Looking good for Abs, despite his being \"an old man\", according to motormouth Taylor.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>4.09am:</strong> Let's raise that bar, fellow Bulldogs. What's one more former colony between sporting rivals? Or, as Oliver Pattenden puts it: \"What do you mean we've become more concerned with beating the bastards below? USA's not that far away you know.\" Yes, yes... and Uncle Sam has been pretty feeble this time around. They'll be on their knees by 2012, surely...?</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>4.13am:</strong> Taylor and Ballard are prattling on like a pair of washerwomen. Abs and Wee Tom are 7th and 9th after the fourth set of dives - two more to go, I think. Taylor is definitely the most annoying speakbox the BBC have chosen to employ - even more so than Hyperactive Matt 'HOIME' Baker.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>4.14am:</strong> Daley picks up nines for a score of 89, and Taylor is getting all bombastic. He... thinks... if... he... speaks... slower... it... makes... him... sound... more... author-ta-tive.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>4.20am</strong> \"I never thought I'd say this but we have to be thankful for an Aussie gold - pole vaulter Steve Hooker beat Evgeny Lukyanenko and kept the Russians below us on the table.\" So says a Pommie Barsteward from northern Straya. And he's <a href=\"http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/INF/AT/C92A/ATM072000.shtml\">right</a> you know - the last medal of Friday. Abs has just made a RIGHT RICKETT of his dive!!! Taylor groans like it's enema time. Fours for our boy...</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>4.25am: Team GB diving</strong> Daley's in 6th now, but Waterfield has plummeted to 13th. He's just four points behind the guy in 12th, so all is not lost... but he's made a rod for his own back there.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>4.28am:</strong> It's 1-1 between Japan and the puny US - the only country to stand between us and China at the top of the medal table - in the baseball. You'd think with exclusive access to the 'World Series', the Yanks might do a bit better, really.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>4.31am: Wee Tom wrinkles his nose like a church mouse</strong>, but that dive should be good enough. Only 60-odd... but Ballard reports that the little tyke has a 'Q' by his name, so he's definitely qualified. Splendid.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>4.34am:</strong> We're getting to the crunch now, dear reader(s). Can baldy Pete 'Stock Aitken' Waterfield make it through...?</p><p>Football final soon. Argentina (current champeens) v Nigeria (who won it in 96). Grrrr</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>4.37am: Ballard reckons Waterfield needs mid-eighties...</strong> the 3.8 degree of difficulty results in a bit of a splash. He's scored 76, but this is the sharp end and that mightn't be good enough.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>4.40am:</strong> And do you know who the Super Eagles beat in Atlanta? Yup, twas the Albicelestes. Should be a good one, this. Things not looking good for Waterfield, meanwhile.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>4.42am:</strong> Tough break for Waterfield, he misses out by less than six points, finishing 13th. Wee Tom, the cheeky little blighter who's charmed us all*, finished eighth, and is through to this afternoon's final. He dived well, snide giggling aside, and kept his composure despite being right on the cusp going into that semi.</p><p>*If he hasn't charmed you in particular, kindly keep it you yourself, like a good patriot</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>4.50am: The Germans, another nation straggling in our glorious wake, have picked up gold in the women's cross country cycling.</strong> Russia collect a meaningless bronze. You need GOLDs now, Uncle Vanya, y'hear? We're back to the hinterland of obscure Olympic events now. It's a choice of Taekwondo, Table Tennis repeats, or... Team GB hockey's titanic struggle for 5th against Korea. I'm torn.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>4.55am: It's Chiles play over in the National Stadium.</strong> Time for the football, ladies and gents. GB 0-0 Korea, in the men's hockey, if you're in. Opinions on the man redefining ubiquitous, Adrian Chiles?</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>5.00am:</strong> Plenty of Premier League interest here, with Javier Mascherano in blue and white and Victor Anichebe, who missed an absolute sitter in the semi, on the bench for Nigeria. The Everton striker did <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zdm8tIgNXrY\">score in the group stage though</a>. Barca's Lionel Messi should be the star of today's show however.</p><p><strong>GB 2-1 Korea in the hockey.</strong> Whoop whoop!</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>5.05am:</strong> Decent penalty shout for Sergio Aguero, but that would have been harsh on Nigeria. Sublime ball from Messi to set the Atletico Madrid striker through.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>5.07am:</strong> Argentina have settled quickly, but Nigeria have a free-kick some 40 yards out. \"Has Chiles redefined 'ubiquitous' to mean 'underwhelmingly mediocre'?\" Ollie Pattenden with that poser. Keeper saves comfortably for Argentina.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>5.11am</strong> Nigeria aren't too shabby on the ball themselves, but Riquelme and Messi are seeing plenty of the play. Great run from Di Maria before he's brought down on the edge of the box... Riquelme drifts a disappointing effort over though.</p><p>It's now 3-1 in the hockey, by the way.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>5.14am:</strong> Nice interchange on the right of the area, but Okoronkwo can only blaze well over. Bit more composure required there, reckons Leroy Rosenior.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>5.17am:</strong> Gago and Mascherano are happy to break up play and look for their team-mates breaking ahead of them. Mad Masch plays a delightful dink into the right channel... only for it to bounce of the back of Riquelme's head. Doh</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>5.18am:</strong> Messi sidesteps on the edge of the 18-yard box, but the Nigerians close him down and he can't find Aguero. Seconds later, Aguero is denied by a brilliant sliding challenge as he attacks the box from the left.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>5.20am: Team GB hockey</strong> The Brit lads are tearing Korea apart, Jonty Clarke adding a fourth and his second. 4-1</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>5.22am:</strong> Okoronkwo almost finds the delightfully-named Promise Isaac in the box, but a position of more than a little promise comes to nothing. Argentina look menacing, but are yet to have a clear sight of goal.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>5.25am:</strong> As the sound of the brass band floats across the stadium Messi sidles his way into the area again... and is brought down, surely. The ref's having none of it though.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>5.27am:</strong> Looped cross from Ebenezer Ajilore and Odemwingie can only send his header onto the roof of the net. More good work from the African side, as Victor Obinna lashes one from distance. Straight at Romero between the Argentinian sticks.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>5.30am:</strong> I think it's 4-2 in the hockey at half time. And Nigeria were one well-executed back heel from playing Obinna through one-on-one. Odemwingie thens crashes a bit of a sighter wide of the right-hand upright.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>5.33am:</strong> They're all having a drink now, which seems a bit village green. And we're back...</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>5.36am:</strong> Aguero takes a superb touch in the area, but is adroitly ushered away from goal. Nigeria look pretty well-marshalled at the back to me.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>5.38am:</strong> Oh... Oooooh! Odemwingie powers past his man and drills a ball across the face of goal, which no one can get a touch on. The ball is cleared, but then returned to the goalmouth and Isaac is surprised to find it ricochet off his body and safely into Romero's arms. A simple tap-in, that's how Leroy Rosenior saw it.</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>5.41am:</strong> Nigeria are having their best passage of play and Argentina's superstars can't get a foot on the ball. But will they live to rue that miss from Isaac?</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>5.44am:</strong> Aguero's cross nearly finds Di Maria at the back post, but it's successfully, if a little streakily, cleared. Mascherano then booms a 30-yarder vaguely in the direction of the goal.</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>5.48am:</strong> We've got a bronze medal match between China and Cuba in the women's volleyball underway elsewhere, as well as plenty of Taekwondo. <strong>Team GB's Sarah Stevenson</strong> went through earlier, and you can read about it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.olympicstaekwondo\">here</a>. In the fussball, Ambruse Vanzekin just manages to tip Di Maria's drive around his post. Nearly caught out there, was the Nigerian keeper.</p><!-- Block 62 --><p><strong>5.50am:</strong> Bit of Argie-bargie between the sides as the half-time whistle goes. An excellent block from Dele Adeleye prevented Argentina getting near the goal moments beforehand. All square, 0-0.</p><!-- Block 63 --><p><strong>5.56am:</strong> Unnervingly media-savvy Tom Daley looks Bob Ballard in the eye, winks, and admits that he's \"brushed away some of the cobwebs\" with that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.britisholympicteam3\">semi-final performance</a>. Selected soundbites thereafter: \"Everything's been good [in Beijing] times ten...\"; \"Anything can happen in an Olympic final...\"; \"[Pete Wakefield] should have been in that final but it's unfortunate that he didn't dive that well...\" [pulling no punches there]; \"I'm going in hoping for a really good performance, but not expecting anything...\" Well, good luck to the wee bairn, of course. TEAM GB! and all that.</p><!-- Block 64 --><p><strong>6.06am:</strong> Still waiting for the lads to come out for the second half. 8-4 to the US in the baseball, the Americans homing in on the bronze.</p><!-- Block 65 --><p><strong>6.10am:</strong> Vanzekin bravely denies the onrushing Aguero as we get back underway. This could be decide by just the one score, as happened four years ago.</p><!-- Block 66 --><p><strong>6.14am:</strong> Messi drives left-footed across the goal from 25-yards, forcing Vanzekin to punch away. Obinna then becomes the first player in the referee's book for a clumsy challenge on right-back Ezequiel Garay.</p><!-- Block 67 --><p><strong>6.16am:</strong> There's a real African atmosphere inside the National Stadium, according to the boys from the Beeb. Argentina clearly have a bit more finesse about them, but Nigeria are hustling and harrying well.</p><!-- Block 68 --><p><strong>6.19am:</strong> Leroy Rosenior is stretching the impartiality a bit here. Still claiming he didn't see the Messi penalty from the first half. Argentina probe again, but there's a bit of a lull to proceedings currently.</p><!-- Block 69 --><p><strong>6.20am: GOAL! Nigeria 0-1 Argentina</strong> After all that, a wonderful finish breaks the deadlock. Messi splits the Nigerian back line and Angel Di Maria sprints through and then produces a sublime chip to defeat Vanzekin, who probably came off his line to early. Great strike still.</p><!-- Block 70 --><p><strong>6.25am:</strong> The Nigerians look a little stunned by that goal, and have retreated into their shell. Messi's twinkling around the danger area... but it's the Super Eagles who have the next effort, Obinna dribbling a shot straight at Romero. Time for Anichebe.</p><!-- Block 71 --><p><strong>6.27am:</strong> And Anichebe nearly makes a decisive first touch! Great low cross from the right, and the Everton striker's effort is bundled around the post from close range. The corner leads to nothing.</p><!-- Block 72 --><p><strong>6.30am:</strong> Yellow card for Onyekachi Apam as he clatters Di Maria. Riquleme's whipped strike from the dead ball is deflected off for a corner.</p><!-- Block 73 --><p><strong>6.34am:</strong> Just under 20 minutes for Nigeria to conjure something or it's going to be second-place silver. John Allen in Singapore is looking at Benfica's Angel Di Maria with his most optimistic hat on: \"Blimey, that was a delightful finish from the lad. I wonder if Leicester City have sent the scouts along. Here's hoping.\"</p><!-- Block 74 --><p><strong>6.36am:</strong> Di Maria's obviously heard that Leicester might be looking at him... he's just been booked for tugging back an opponent.</p><!-- Block 75 --><p><strong>6.38am:</strong> Drama in the Argentina penalty area as both Odemwingie and Ekpo fail to get a touch on the ball as it squirts in front of goal. Messi then does his thing at the other end and almost plays in Aguero... and Pablo's Zabaleta's cross is scrambled away by Vanzekin moments later.</p><!-- Block 76 --><p><strong>6.41am:</strong> Kaita's snap shot flies just over, but the keeper hasn't had to work for that. Jose Sosa replaces Aguero for the Albicelestes.</p><!-- Block 77 --><p><strong>6.45am:</strong> It's getting a little niggly, both Monzon and Riquelme booked for time wasting. Nigeria look like their luck's run out here.</p><!-- Block 78 --><p><strong>6.47am:</strong> Romero makes a crucial block from Anichebe, who's been a nuisance in the box since coming on.</p><!-- Block 79 --><p><strong>6.50am:</strong> Angel Di Maria has been stretchered off, apparently due to the heat. This one's winding down and the Argentinians are only too pleased. Both teams seem pretty drained.</p><!-- Block 80 --><p><strong>6.53am:</strong> Messi scoots off with the ball and then wins a free-kick deep in Nigeria's half. We're into added time... of which there will be five minutes! Where's that come from? Still hope for the Africans.</p><!-- Block 81 --><p><strong>6.58am:</strong> Okonkwo balloons one high and wide, but there was little on for the Nigerian. And Lavezzi wins a free-kick right in the corner for the South Americans... the ball's been pumped long though. To no avail. We're over 95 minutes now.</p><!-- Block 82 --><p><strong>7.00am: Argentina win the gold medal</strong> and they did enough to retain their Olympic title. Messi, whom everyone agrees was the difference between the sides, looks pretty chuffed - but Chilesy is not happy with the amount of Mexican waves going on in the stands. Tsk, lugubrious Baggies, eh...</p><!-- Block 83 --><p><strong>7.03am: We won the men's hockey 5-2 as it turned out.</strong> It was coming up to full time when I thought things were only halfway through. Fifth place and all the glory that comes with it to Team GB. Stunning.</p><!-- Block 84 --><p><strong>7.10am:</strong> Well folks, there's another day of BOUNDLESS GLORY ahead for Team GB.<strong> The good doctor Brabants is next on the card in the K1 500m</strong>, although he's not off for about an hour. <strong>Lucy Wainwright</strong> will be going for metal of some colour in the women's event. We've also got <strong>Oliver Beckingsale and Liam Killeen</strong> in the men's mountain biking. Some <strong>4x400m</strong> shenanigans later on too. Thoughts and digressions, guardianistas, please.</p><!-- Block 85 --><p><strong>7.20am:</strong> Hungary are 15-14 up against Korea in the women's handball bronze medal match. And China have snaffled another medal, bronze this time, in the volleyball, seeing off Cuba.</p><p>John Allen's still mulling the possibility of Argentinian match winner Angel Di Maria turning out for the Foxes, meanwhile: \"Di Maria better be back at the Walkers for our game against Tranmere this afternoon. And Singapore TV has gone back to ping pong, it doesn't get much worse than this.\"</p><!-- Block 86 --><p><strong>7.25am:</strong> Handball appears to a cross between American football, basketball, and rugby. I have no idea how the rules work. I can however watch instant replays of eveything by virtue of the fact that the BBC's web feed is a bit behind Eurosport's coverage. Double confusion. Hun 18-17 Kor</p><!-- Block 87 --><p><strong>7.28am:</strong> 18 apiece now. So far, I'd say it's not as fun to watch as volleyball, which can be brilliantly bananas, but a fair bit better than dressage, which seems an incomprehensible waste of a horse's good time. Lot's of running into each other... and then BAM!, the Koreans hit the post.</p><!-- Block 88 --><p><strong>7.30am:</strong> Korea whack one in off the crossbar, but the Hungarians pull things level... only to fall behind and then equalise again. Norway and Russia will contest the gold medal match at 8.45am. Go Norway!</p><!-- Block 89 --><p><strong>7.34am:</strong> John, our man in Singapore, has joined me in ignorance. \"We're onto the women's handball here now. I haven't a clue what is going on, mind you, but I just can't handle any more table tennis! Does anyone know the rules? All I can figure out for myself is that jumping is encouraged.\" Jumping does certainly seem to be encouraged. It's one of those sports where the teams continually trade the advantage, too, indicative of a fatal (boring) flaw in the scoring system, I say. Kor 22-22 Hun</p><!-- Block 90 --><p><strong>7.40am:</strong> Submissions for most baffling sport of the Games? Handball is vaguely confusing, but I think it can be beaten. I have no idea how a lot of the gymnastics is rated; judo seems fairly bewildering too. Korea have sneaked ahead 26-25... but Hungary have a penalty, which looks a lot like a free goal to me. 26-26. Hockey? That has some weird rules.</p><!-- Block 91 --><p><strong>7.44am:</strong> Apart from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/23/olympics2012.olympics20082\">army of buffoons doubtless preparing for tomorrow's caper</a>, there's sod all appears to be happening in Beijing. Well, there's probably some human rights being oppressed somewhere too*. One of the Koreans has just floated a deft lob over the keeper... but it's off the post. And there also appears to have been a couple of sending-offs. Kor 29-27 Hun</p><p>*This is mere idle speculation and not a statement of fact</p><!-- Block 92 --><p><strong>7.49am:</strong> Hungary are hurting from that double two-minute suspension I mentioned earlier - yes, I did - and they've slipped to a three-point deficit. The Koreans can smell that rusty third-place medal... 30-27</p><!-- Block 93 --><p><strong>7.52am: Bamboozled by Beijing.</strong> Welcome to the MBM Barry Hawthorne, who provides a welcome distraction from the handball. \"I know you Brits are really good at that Velodrome stuff, but what are the rules concerning that pursuit race? Why do they have to play a 'cat and mouse' race?\" Hmmm, well, I think it's mainly because if one of 'em goes charging off, they'll get knackered pronto, and lose, Bazza... Personally I found the Madison more difficult to work out. And we didn't come up with the goods in that one.</p><!-- Block 94 --><p><strong>8.00am:</strong> I think the Koreans won that 33-28. It became a bit of a blood bath at the end. <strong>Bronze goes to Korea, then.</strong> After such a MASSIVE, MASSIVE game, I am well and truly spent. Luckily, I can pass on the baton, in best Team GB style, to the one and only Mr Barry Glendenning. And be warned, <strong>don't get him started on nouns being used a verbs...</strong></p><!-- Block 95 --><p><strong>8.01am:</strong> [brief and unedifying scrabble on the floor for MBM schedule and preparatory notes ensues]</p><!-- Block 96 --><p><strong>8.09am:</strong> Good morning everyone. Alan's correct - you won't hear the word \"medal\" used as a verb on my watch. I think I saw my colleague Sean Ingle commit this crime against literacy in the newspaper yesterday or the day before and he'll be feeling the back of my hand when he gets home from Beijing, unless the Chinese government intern him and all the other journalists who've been committing it in \"re-education camps\" for a couple of years. The only Briton I can think of who's \"meddled\" in the Far East in recent years is Gary Glitter, and the less said about him, the better.</p><!-- Block 97 --><p><strong>8.27pm:</strong> Sorry about that. I've just been fielding a phone call from Sean Ingle. Imagine how much longer it would have been if he'd read that last entry.</p><!-- Block 98 --><p><strong>8.29am: Men's Kayak K1 500m final featuring Great Britain's Tim Brabant</strong> In Lane 1, Tim Brabants gets off to a flyer and is in second place at the halfway mark. Australia's Ken Wallace gets the gold medal, Adam van Somebodyorother from Canada gets second, despite having had a huge lead at the halfway stage and Tim Brabants gets the bronze for Great Britain. Dr Brabant has brought Great Britain's medal's tally to a whopping 45.</p><!-- Block 99 --><p><strong>8.37am:</strong> Officially, there's a photo-finish in the Kayak race, but I'm pretty sure it'll be as you were at 8.29am ... except I hope to find out the Canadian's surname at some point in the near future.</p><!-- Block 100 --><p><strong>8.42am:</strong> Still no sign of the official result of the Men's Kayak K1 500m final. They must have used one of those cameras you see in westerns, where an old bloke holds a flash in one hand before ducking under a cloth hanging down the back.</p><!-- Block 101 --><p><strong>8.44am:</strong> \"Brabant should know that bronzing for us isn't good enough, Team GB expects athletes to gold every time,\" writes Oliver Pattenden, committing further crimes against the English language. The old photographer has emerged from the dark room and the official result of the men's Kayaking K1 500m final is in: Gold: Ken Wallace (Australia). Silver: Adam van Koeverden (Canada). Bronze: Tim Brabants (Great Britain).</p><!-- Block 102 --><p><strong>8.50pm:</strong> It's the women's +67kg Taekwondo quarter-finals and Great Britain's Sarah Stevenson is up against the unbeaten double Olympic champion China's Chen Zong. With it being an event with judges featuring a Chinese athlete, it should go without saying that Stevenson is losing - she's 1-0 down in the third round and is getting increasingly frustrated with the judges.</p><!-- Block 103 --><p><strong>8.54am:</strong> For the second time in 24 hours, a Briton is <em>robbed</em> in the Taekwondo. With the last kick of the contest, Stevenson got a clean kick on Chen Zong's head, which would have earned her two points and victory. She appealed for the points, the judges had a pow-wow and then didn't give it to her. That is an unbelievable travesty.</p><!-- Block 104 --><p><strong>8.56am:</strong> Despite being a victim of an outrageous injustice,  Sarah Stevenson is fairly calm in her post-bout interview - that is to say, she's a lot calmer than I would be if I'd just come a cropper in a similar fashion. In the BBC studio, Clare Balding and Adrian Chiles are absolutely outraged. For reasons I don't understand, Stevenson still has a <em>slim</em> chance of getting to fight for bronze in the repechage. If she has to fight a Chinese in it, she might as well not turn up.</p><!-- Block 105 --><p><strong>9.09am:</strong> Tim Brabants is being interviewed after \"thirding\" in the Kayaking. He's thanking everyone at home for all the support and saying it'll be \"easy to go back home and be Dr Tim again because nobody ever recognises me.\" Meanwhile, this from Gary Naylor: \"Like JPR Wiliams stitching his own face at half-time, does Dr Brabants get to do his own drug test?\"</p><!-- Block 106 --><p><strong>9.12am:</strong> Bad news for Great Britain - Russia have just passed them in the medals table. The Brits need another gold quickly, but they're not going to get one in the men's mountain biking, where France's Julien Absalon, the defending champion and four times world champion,  is winning at his leisure. He's being followed by another Frenchman, Jean-Christophe Peraud, while Switzerland's Nino Schurter is coming third. For Great Britain, Liam Killeen and Oliver Beckingsale will be giving interviews afterwards in which they'll tell us what a great experience they've had and how much it'll stand to them for London 2012. Whatever ...</p><!-- Block 107 --><p><strong>9.20am: Women's Kayak K1 500m final featuring Great Britain's Lucy Wainwright.</strong> Wainwright in Lane 8 misses the jump badly and is well down at the halfway mark. She doesn't finish in the medals, but it's another photo finish which is won by Inna Osypenko-Rodomska from the Ukraine, with Italy finishing second and Germany third. Wainright was seventh, but I'm sure she enjoyed the experience and it'll stand to her in London 2012.</p><!-- Block 108 --><p><strong>9.30am:</strong> \"Just reading your excellent coverage of Olympics. Without being all 'Channel 4 News' about it, isn't Sarah Stevenson in danger of being sent to a Chinese Re-education Camp for her protests?\" asks Sam Williams. Well thank you very much for your kind words, Sam, but I think our Olympic coverage - this bit of it at least - was excellent until I took over. This is my Olympic Rolling Report debut and I'm struggling badly. The fact that I'm usually only going home at this time on a Saturday morning isn't helping. I thought Sarah Stevenson was remarkably stoic considering the robbery that was visited upon her. I mean, it's difficult to put into words how much of a travesty it was. She nearly kicked her Chinese opponent's head clean off her shoulders and at least two of the judges managed to miss it. Imagine of Padraig Harrington had holed his winning putt in the US PGA and the tournament officials had just ignored it and handed the trophy to Sergio Garcia instead - that's how bad it was.</p><!-- Block 109 --><p><strong>9.35am:</strong> The men's mountain-biking is still going on, with France's Julian Absalon looking home and hosed for France. His compatriot Peraud is still coming second, over a minute behind. Two Swiss riders are battling it out for third place, while the Brits are coming 11th and 15th respectively.</p><!-- Block 110 --><p><strong>9.41am: </strong> \"That taekwondo bout just about nails it for me with every sport that requires a judges score,\" harrumphs Tom Clarke. \"There have been numerous scandals in the boxing, why on earth did they bring another sport like that in? However, surely with 'home support' we must do better in 2012?\"</p><!-- Block 111 --><p><strong>9.42am:</strong> With just one lap of the circuit to go out of eight, France's Julien Absalon  leads his compatriot Jean-Christophe Peraud - barring an accident they'll finish first and second respectively. Swiss riders Nino Schurter and Christoph Sauser are almost certain to duke it out for the bronze medal, as they've opened a decent gap to Germany's Manuel Fumic.</p><!-- Block 112 --><p><strong>The shame of it - this is the result that put the Russians ahead of Great Britain in the medals table ...</strong></p><p>Olympic synchronised swimming team free routine.</p><p>1.

He crosses the line, jumps off his bike, taps the road and waves appreciatively to the cheering crowd. Soon after, Jean Christophe Peraud rolls home to bag silver, while Nino Schurter comfortably beats Christoph Sauser to take bronze for the Swiss. For Great Britain, Liam Killeen finishes in a very credita ... no, it's very creditable because he had a crash early doors, 7th place. His thunder is somewhat stolen, however, by Italy's Marco Fontana, who finished 5th in extravagant style by riding the last couple of hundred metres pulling a one-handed wheelie. Top class!</p><!-- Block 114 --><p><strong>10.14am:</strong> With nothing Olympic on at the moment, the BBC have handed over to Shirley \"Blonde in a boat\" Robertson, who is interviewing people at the Great Britain sailing party. They're all heroically drunk, including her. \"Sheesh my besht boson's mate!\" Meanwhile back at the Taekwondo, all hell os breaking lose, where the Great Britain team have lodged an official complaint about the ridiculous result of the Sarah Stevenson match. The competition supervisory board has looked into the matter and ... CHANGED THE RESULT!!!</p><!-- Block 115 --><p>VERY BRAVE TAEKWONDO OFFICIAL: \"In applying paragraph two on page 64 of the competition rules we have to change this result and to declare the British player as the winner. Justice is served.\"<br/>ANGRY CHINESE MOB: \"Boooooo! Boo!\"</p><p>Apparently this is unprecedented in Taekwondo - presumably the Chinese will appeal this decisions. Who'd have thunk a game of Lots Of Jumping But Not Much Kicking could be so exciting?</p><!-- Block 116 --><p><strong>10.26am:</strong> It's worth noting that the announcement that the result of the Sarah Stevenson bout hjas been overturned has not yet been made in mandarin - all hell could break loose when that happens. Stevenson is now in the semi-final against a Mexican. On the BBC, the <em>chef d'equipe</em> of the British taekwondo team is saying that the Chinese had no grumbles about their girl getting her \"win\" taken away from her.</p><!-- Block 117 --><p><strong>10.32am:</strong> Chen Zong, the Chinese girl who has now been eliminated from the taekwondo, had been going for her third consecutive Olympic gold medal, so Stevenson couldn't have taken a bigger scalp. However, there are thousands of Chinese fans in the hall waiting to see their hero Chen Zong fight a Mexican - they still haven't been told what's going on in their own language.</p><!-- Block 118 --><p><strong>10.37am:</strong> According to my man near the spot, Sean Ingle, the Chinese may have re-protested. The scoreboard currently reads: \"Beijing apologises for the delay. Competition will commence shortly.\" The word from the BBC's commentator is that Great Britain's Sarah Stevenson will take on Mexico's Maria Espinoza in the taekwondo semi-final in five minutes.</p><!-- Block 119 --><p><strong>10.46am:</strong> It's announced in Mandarin, to the rather partisan crowd, that their girl won't be fighting in the semi-final. To say they're not best pleased is putting it mildly. Espinoza and Stevenson emerge for their bout to the sound of much booing. The rules: one point for a kick to your opponent's body, two points for a kick upsides their head. They get underway and at the end of round one, much to the delight of the largely Chinese audience, Stevenson finds herself 2-0 down.</p><!-- Block 120 --><p><strong>10.49am:</strong> Round two: Sarah Stevenson goes 3-0 down after shipping another kick in the red protector around her torso. Moments later, she's 4-1 down and goes down with an injury to her right leg. At the end of round two, Stevenson finds herself 4-1 down and limping badly.</p><!-- Block 121 --><p><strong>10.53am:</strong> Thirty seconds into round three and Espinoza goes down injured, but she's OK. Bah! \"Sarah Stevenson needs the big head shot ... the money shot,\" says the BBC's Nick Mullins. Money shots? <em>Money shots?</em> That's a rule of Taekwondo I'm not familiar with, I have to confess. Anyway, the Mexican's chin remains blissfully splash- and foot-free, and she takes the win and goes on to fight for silver or gold, while Stevenson gets to fight for bronze. Despite getting her reprieve, Sarah Stevenson is saying that she didn't get enough time to prepare for her fight and wasn't ready for it. From where I'm sitting, it sounds suspiciously like a whinge.</p><!-- Block 122 --><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NfkH3Q4JOQ\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4NfkH3Q4JOQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p><strong>11.04am:</strong> Here's that Taekwondo fight to keep you amused while I go for a short break.</p><!-- Block 123 --><p><strong>11.21am:</strong> \"Dear Esteemed Guardian Journo,\" writes Rob Bloxham, beginning a mail I have a terrible feeling is going to be incredibly patronising. </p><p>\"I know it's a little late (being Day 15 of this glorious sporting and marketing extravaganza) but I feel it's about time I drew your attention to an error that may have profound consequences for the future of the British Union.

It's like a free gold for Team GB (and any people from the 6 counties who want in, too).\"</p><!-- Block 129 --><p><strong>12.09pm: Boxing:</strong> Scrap that chronology as it seems it's boxing up first, with the Hammersmith Hammer James DeGale going for gold in the ring. I say Hammersmith Hammer, although I've only got the word of Rebranded Website's and two-time Beer Writer of the Year's Ben MacFarland to go on, who claims to have grown up on the similar west London mean streets as DeGale.</p><!-- Block 130 --><p><strong>12.13pm: The Naylor report:</strong> \"I'm deeply disappointed that Team GB failed to impress in the synchronised swimming,\" laments Our Gary. \"Had it done so, it might have inspired a generation in the municipal pools around the country.

The Thai fighter is dumped on his rear during the third round, but has the last laugh as the BBC decides to end it right there and tell us that he won 8-2. Again, you heard it here second.</p><!-- Block 132 --><p><strong>12.17pm: Taekwondo:</strong> Here's Sarah Stevenson in the taekwondo repechage, against Noha Abd Rabo, of Egypt. \"This day has been full of shenanigans and drama,\" says the taekwondo commentator, and he's not wrong. Take a spin through Glendenning's work earlier to catch up.</p><!-- Block 133 --><p><strong>12.19pm: Taekwondo: </strong>There's a good deal of squeaking to add to the kicking, jumping and dancing preciously described by newcomers to taekwondo in this MBM report. As a veteran of this pursuit, having watched Aaron Cook yesterday, I can tell you that it's hardly going according to the script here: Stevenson is 3-0 up at the end of the second round, which is not how it works for Team GB!GB!GB!'s taekwondo fighters. This should be a nailed on glorious defeat.</p><!-- Block 134 --><p><strong>12.22pm: Taekwondo: </strong> The Egyptian gets a point back against Stevenson, to bring her within two.

From Africa, Asia or the Americas.</p><!-- Block 138 --><p><strong>12.37pm: Athletics:</strong> \"Two laps of intrigue and surely drama as well,\" says Steve Cram, bigging up the final of the 800m as though it's the new Inspector Morse.

In the bronze medal match of the men's over 80kg class, the Cuban player Angel Matos was timed out after going over the 60 seconds allowed for an on-mat injury. His Kazakh opponent celebrated the bronze and Matos got up and KICKED THE REFEREE IN THE HEAD. I kid you not. He's just KICKED THE REFEREE IN THE HEAD. \"There could be police involvement,\" says Nick Mullins in the commentary box. \"There could be war,\" adds Barry Glendenning in my ear.</p><!-- Block 142 --><p><strong>12.56pm: </strong>Britain's Lisa Dobriskey is running in the final of the 1500m at the Bird's Nest, but I can't keep my eyes off the taekwondo hall feed and the hope that we see that referee kick again. No luck as yet, but this is a global incident in the making.</p><!-- Block 143 --><p><strong>12.58pm: Athletics: </strong> The censors are out in the taekwondo hall and they're pretending that it never happened. But I saw it with my own eyes (fortuitously, I grant you), that guy kicked the referee. Anyway, Lisa Dobrisky finished in fourth - agonising fourth as it's now officially known - after, apparently, getting her tactics wrong. No kidding. Anyway, Nancy Langat, of Kenya, won gold ahead of two Ukrainians. \"It's just a shame they don't give medals for fourth,\" says Brendan Foster. Made of what, Brendan? Tin? You don't go to Beijing to fourth.</p><!-- Block 144 --><p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> USA are playing Brazil in the final of the women's volleyball.

Then it's three, and then one back for the Cuban, and then one more. And then ... what? ... DeGale gets two points after apparently being bitten by Correa. \"Hey, he bit me,\" DeGale says, and the ref agreed. The Brit leads 6-1 at the end of the first.</p><!-- Block 158 --><p><strong>1.54pm: Boxing: </strong> A thunderous right hand from DeGale takes him to 7-3 and then another couple of dabs gets him a 10-4 lead at the end of the round. The Cuban has lost his discipline already, in profound contrast to the \"Hammersmith Hammer\", who dances around a couple of haymakers from Correa and sneaks another quick point with a jab at the end.</p><!-- Block 159 --><p><strong>1.58pm:</strong> It's not pretty, but DeGale leads 12-10 at the end of the round, and is still looking for gold against a Cuban who seems keen just to hold on, drop back, and then charge messily forward. But that's a good end to the round for Correa, who connects with several swift combinations and might actually fancy his chances now. So don't read the top bit of this update, jut the bottom bit.</p><p>Something else that wasn't pretty was the Cuban taekwondo referee-fight earlier, and his full crimes have now been listed as punching a referee, kicking a judge and spat on the floor. A perfect hat-trick, that has now earned him a lifetime ban for him and his coach.</p><!-- Block 160 --><p><strong>2.01pm:</strong> Anther scrappy round, but DeGale shows more composure to time a couple of right-hands to go 15-12 ahead. But the Cuban gets it back to 15-13 with 30 seconds left and DeGale attempts to cling on, literally, to the victory. He gets another smart jab in with 20 seconds left to go 16-14 up, and that's it.

Bahamas take the silver and Russia the bronze.</p><!-- Block 166 --><p><strong>2.18pm: Diving: </strong>Tom Daley lies sixth after the fifth round of the diving. The Chinese diver Luxin Zhou is on course for a pillar-to-post gold. He leads with 458.35 judge's points. Daley has 398.95.</p><!-- Block 167 --><p><strong>2.23pm:</strong> I think there are 10 rounds in the diving; there were in the semis, but maybe the final is different, who knows. I think they go in reverse order in each round, which means the young chimney sweep Daley will be off soon-ish. South Korea will be the reigning Olympic baseball champions from here until the end of time, as they've just won the last ever final.</p><!-- Block 168 --><p><strong>2.26pm: Diving:</strong> OK, so there are six dives in the final round and Tom Daley has just had his last plummet. It wasn't six of the best for the whippersnapper, and he won't be taking home a medal unless all of the remaining four divers are killed in the next ten seconds.</p><!-- Block 169 --><p><strong>2.28pm: Athletics and Diving: </strong>Your licence fee is currently paying for television coverage of the women's high-jump final, where some very spindly women, including a bespectacled one from Belgium named Tia Hellebaut, are soaring over a bar set at about 2.05m. Blanca Vlasic, of Croatia, has also done that and gets silver at least, with the bronze going to someone else. In the diving, British suggestive wink Tom Daley is out of medal contention, but the Australian Matthew Mitcham takes gold with an amazing last dive.</p><!-- Block 170 --><p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> Australia win gold in the men's 10m diving after Mitchell scored an almost perfect 10 in the final round. The Chinese judge didn't think it was that great, but all the others did and the Australian pipped home favourite Luxin Zhou at the end. That's the only gold medal the Chinese were impartially judged not to have won.</p><!-- Block 171 --><p><strong>2.37pm:</strong> The bespectacled Belgian Tia Hellebaut wins gold in the women's high jump after both her and her better-sighted, or contact-lens wearing, Croatian opponent both clear 2.05m but can't go higher. Hellebaut took fewer previous jumps so wins.</p><!-- Block 172 --><p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> Tom Daley was seventh in the diving, which is creditable for the 14-year-old, I'll grudgingly concede. He's got a difficult late adolescence and unceasing hype to look forward to before he can be officially crowned \"medal prospect\" for London 2012.</p><p>That's that from another MBM day. It's the closing ceremony and hand-over to London tomorrow.

Stretching for tens of thousands of miles over the ocean beds, the vast web of intercontinental submarine cables have brought the possibility of cheap high-speed internet and clear long-distance telephone calls to all major parts of the globe. Except one. </p><p>East Africa remains the only large, inhabited coastline cut off from the global fibre-optic network. Reliant entirely on expensive satellite connections, people on the world's poorest continent pay some of the highest rates for logging on or phoning. Local universities are charged up to 50 times more for bandwidth than a typical American college, making online research slow or impossible. </p><p>\"Imagine you had all the students at Oxford trying to access the web through a single UK household connection,\" said Calestous Juma, a Kenyan professor who heads the Science, Technology and Globalisation Project at Harvard University. \"That's what it's like for most students in Africa.\"</p><p>But with the last piece of the global fibre-optic jigsaw about to fall into place, all that is set to change. In October, the first lengths of a new 9,300-mile submarine cable to serve east Africa will be loaded on to a ship and then unrolled into the Indian Ocean. </p><p><strong>On-ramp</strong></p><p>The &pound;322m Seacom cable, owned mainly by African investors, will stretch northwards from South Africa, making landfall at Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania and Kenya before splitting to tap into the international grid in France and India. Due to be operational by June 2009, it will be closely followed by two more finger-thin cables, including the ambitious Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSy), which will connect 21 countries on the eastern half of Africa to each other and to the world. </p><p>\"For the first time people in the region will have an on-ramp on to the global internet highway,\" said Alan Mauldin, of TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm in the US.</p><p>Indeed, for all the talk of a wireless era, it is physical infrastructure rather than satellite technology that enables cheap and fast communication. Intercontinental fibre-optic cables, which use light signals to transmit data, carry more than 95% of the world's internet and telephone traffic. Many of the existing undersea networks were installed in the telecoms boom of the late 1990s but a second undersea cable-laying spurt is now under way, with &pound;3.5bn-worth of new projects due for completion by 2010. </p><p>One reason is the increased use of video download sites and peer-to-peer applications such as YouTube, which is causing global bandwidth usage to more than double every 18 months. Another is the need for backup cables in case of accidents - earlier this year businesses in the Middle East and India were badly affected for several days when a ship's anchor sliced through two undersea cables off the Egyptian coast. And finally there is demand from places never before connected to the fibre-optic grid. Even sparsely populated areas such as Greenland, which has 56,000 inhabitants, are finding that satellite links can no longer do the job. The self-governing Danish territory is laying a 3,000-mile cable that will link to the global network via Canada and Iceland. </p><p>But it is in the eastern half of Africa where the cables are most keenly awaited. In Kenya a slow and often unreliable broadband internet connection with the main telecoms operator costs &pound;75 a month. In landlocked neighbouring countries the price can be twice as much. </p><p>\"What's stifled demand until now is not poverty,\" said Brian Herlihy, the president of Seacom. \"It's economics - the prices are simply far too high.\"</p><p>The International Financial Corporation, which together with 25 regional telecoms companies, is funding the &pound;170m EASSy undersea link, estimates that its cable alone will cause internet prices to fall by two-thirds in east Africa and the number of online subscribers to triple. </p><p>The cost of telephone calls made to other parts of the continent is also expected to drop once the new submarine and terrestrial links are in place. Many inter-African calls are now routed through Europe or the US. </p><p>The EASSy cable should go live in early 2010, ahead of the football World Cup that year. The host nation, South Africa, is linked to the single undersea cable that runs up the west African coast to Europe but the capacity is insufficient to handle the anticipated broadcast and internet traffic generated by the games. </p><p>Beyond the tournament, however, there are fears that there may be a large oversupply of bandwidth, especially as the Kenyan government has decided to build its own cable from Mombasa to the United Arab Emirates. But Herlihy, who points out that consumers will benefit from lower prices even if this occurs, says the new networks will unleash an \"African technological revolution\", which will quickly drive up demand.</p><p>And it is true that many countries are banking on IT to boost their economies. Rwanda is positioning itself as a regional telecoms hub, a \"Singapore of the Great Lakes\". Kenya has a vibrant community of smart, young programmers whose skills led Google to open a development office in Nairobi last year. It also has a growing outsourcing industry. </p><p><strong>Call centres</strong></p><p>Despite the poor connectivity, a local start-up, Kencall, has already proved it can compete with Indian call centres for US and European clients. In two years its staff has grown from 150 to 650. But Kencall's founder, Nicholas Nesbitt, believes his workforce could reach 5,000 within three years of fibre being installed. \"For a country to be without fibre-optic links today is like being without a harbour in the past - you are landlocked,\" he said. </p><p>Juma said the effect of cheap, fast connectivity on business in the region would be \"phenomenal\". But the biggest potential gains will be had in education, especially if schools and universities are given subsidised bandwidth. Instead of universities and students spending cash on building libraries and buying textbooks, they can access much of the same information for free online, he said. </p><p>\"The speed that knowledge currently moves in Africa is 5mph - walking pace. But with decent connectivity knowledge will travel at the speed of light,\" declared Juma.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/18/east.africa.internet","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2008/aug/18/east.africa.internet","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Eaten up","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-28T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2008/jul/29/food.climatechange","fields":{"body":"<p>There is a passage towards the end of Raj Patel's book, Stuffed and Starved, which elevates its author to the rank of soothsayer. He wrote it at the beginning of 2007, well before the roar of anger about rising food prices that resounded across the planet and that he so uncannily and accurately predicted.</p><p>The passage begins with Patel's summary of earlier sections of the book in which he depicts the wasteland, as he calls it, of the modern food system. It is a system that destroys rural communities, poisons poor city dwellers, is inhumane to animals, demands unsustainable levels of use of fossil fuels and water, contributes to global warming, spreads disease and limits our sensuousness and compassion. As if that litany wasn't enough, he then adds this: \"Perhaps most ironic, although it is controlled by some of the most powerful people on the planet, the food system is inherently weak. It has systemic and structural vulnerabilities that lie close to the surface of our daily lives. All it takes to expose them is a gentle jolt.\"</p><p>When he wrote that passage, Patel had in mind his native Britain and its occasional history of food crises. There was the oil crisis of 1973 that prompted panic-buying in the shops. Or 2000, when protesting truckers blockaded the oil refineries and the shelves again came close to emptying. Those events inspired Patel to contemplate a startling question: \"What would have happened,\" he wrote, \"had all the food on the shelves run out?\" </p><p>He left that question dangling in the book. But he got thinking about it again as he was on a tour of Australia last August promoting the book. As he travelled from Perth to Melbourne and then Sydney he kept being asked the same question: how did the drought that by then was already biting hard on Australian farmers as well as on consumers who were suffering rising prices, fit into his critique of modern food production? As he faced his audiences, it began to look to Patel, in a tentative, creeping way, that the gentle jolt he had written about was really happening. </p><p>\"What was weird was that the stories I was hearing about drought and farmers in desperation were very similar to the stories that had been told to me in India a couple of years before. They were all about small independent farmers up to their eyeballs in debt. They had borrowed hugely to make a go of it, and then there'd been a shock - in Australia it was drought, in India it might be harvest failure, in Britain foot-and-mouth. It only takes one small shock.\"</p><p>And then the agricultural slurry really hit the fan. The first intimations of something truly out of the ordinary came in Mexico in early 2007, before he had finished writing Stuffed and Starved. There were reports of unrest in some of the larger cities about rising food prices, partly related to the decision of the US government to divert huge quantities of corn to ethanol production, in an attempt to reduce dependence on foreign oil. Then early this year  some eight months after Patel had finished writing about the risk of gentle jolts - the so-called \"silent tsunami\" began. Food prices appeared to be out of control, spiralling up by 68% in the case of rice in the first four months of this year alone. Wheat and corn almost doubled in a year. </p><p>Such hikes on the costs of the basics of life hit the urban poor in the cities of the developing world hardest, and the misery was soon made manifest in the form of unrest. Impromptu protests grew into angry marches and then erupted into food riots. In Haiti six people died and the prime minister was ousted from power. Two days of rioting ensued in Egypt and 24 people died in Cameroon. The pattern repeated itself right across the developing world, from Guyana and Bolivia to Ivory Coast, Surinam and Senegal, Yemen, Uzbekistan, Bangladesh and South Korea. Wild events in turn prompted wild official responses. Vietnam introduced a night curfew on harvesting machines to stop illegal raiding of the fields; any Filipino caught hoarding rice was threatened with life in jail, Malaysia cancelled all public building works and switched instead to stockpiling food. Even the rich western world was hit. Food prices in the UK have risen almost 7% year on year, shaking the government's economic confidence. And if any doubts remained about the severity of this crisis, Wal-Mart, the supermarket goliath that stands at the pinnacle of the modern food system, announced it was imposing a four-bag limit for rice on its cash-and-carry customers to stop a run on supplies.</p><p>For millions of people around the world the soaring prices have spelt disaster - the World Bank has put the number of people who have been pushed into hunger at 100 million. But for one person, the impact has been strangely and paradoxically counter-factual. When Stuffed and Starved - Patel's first book - came out last August, he and his publishers imagined it would at best enjoy a specialist readership among globalisation activists attuned to issues of corporate greed and exploitation. But the food crisis has turned it from being a niche read into the literary equivalent of a crystal ball. As a result, the demand has in Patel's words \"gone bonkers\". Reprints have been ordered in Britain, the US and Spain, deals done for editions in Italy, China and South Korea and half a dozen translations are under discussion. \"If I had been this popular at school I'd be a different man today,\" he quips. His analysis of the crisis, as the author of the book that predicted it all, is now hotly sought after. Or as Patel, who has the savvy Londoner's gift for self-deprecation, puts it: \"Spank me, and call me Cassandra!\"</p><p>We meet for lunch in a restaurant within a Big Mac's throw from Capitol Hill in Washington. It's trivial I know, but it's impossible not to be curious - a little intimidated even - about what Patel will order from the menu. He points out in his book that the livestock industry is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than cars. So will he go for the hanger steak?</p><p>He asks for a pizza with goat's cheese and mushrooms, but when I ask whether his choice was politically or ethically motivated, he laughs. \"I haven't had a steak in my life. Growing up in a Hindu household, I clamoured for hamburgers like any other kid and my parents said: 'Oh, if you must.' But they drew the line at steak.\"</p><p>Patel sees in himself, and his eating habits, a tale in microcosm of the globalisation he writes about. His family on his mother's side were civil servants in Kenya, and tin miners in Fiji on his father's side. They both were drawn to the mother country, arriving in London in the 60s, where they met. It later became a cliche, but they were among the first to open up \"Mr Patel's corner shop\", working 18-hour days in an era before 24-hour supermarkets. The earliest memories of their son, who was born in 1972, are of playing among the fags, mags and sweets in the shop in Golders Green. It would be too neat, I hazard, to suggest that his parents were forced to close down the shop because of competition with the supermarkets? \"My dad did very well for himself,\" he replies, speaking with a high-velocity stammer. \"But they were certainly driven out. You can't compete any more, the corner shop is a dying industry.\"</p><p>Despite those difficulties, the Patels did proud by their son, sending him to a north London grammar school, then to Oxford where he studied PPE, and finally to Berkeley in California. Along the way, he became interested in, and engaged with, the anti-globalisation movement. He was among the thousands who protested in Seattle against the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1999, and it was there that he came face to face with what he calls the \"march of the farmers' movement\" in the form of arguably the world's largest network of independent organisations, La Via Campesina, which represents around 150 million farm workers and smallholders across the globe. \"I was struck by their sophisticated and detailed critique of the WTO. Seven years before Seattle they had already translated the draft text of the Dunkel report [on trade] into Kannada and were distributing it in the fields.\"</p><p>He began delving more deeply into the subject of trade, food policy and agricultural resistance as an analyst at Food First, a radical thinktank in Oakland, where an idea for a book emerged. It began life as a meditation on choice, or the lack of it - Coke v Pepsi, McDonald's v Wendy's. Its working title was Choice Cuts. Over the next three years he travelled to research the book from South Africa, Europe and South Korea to Brazil, Mexico and the US. In the process the thesis grew bigger in scope and more refined. Its focus was no longer just a lack of consumer choice, it embraced an entire world food system that can consign 800 million - more than one in 10 people on earth - to hunger while simultaneously inflicting obesity on an even greater number, 1 billion people. Hence the book's new, and in his opinion better, title.</p><p>His analysis shows how communities around the planet have been disempowered by a system that appears to offer an abundance of cheap food, but in reality dictates unhealthy and limited choices to an overworked and underpaid workforce that cannot afford any better. \"The figure that often stuns people outside the US when I tour with the book is that 20% of American fast-food meals are eaten in cars. People are incredulous and ask: is that because Americans so love their cars? But living here you see how hard people work, for a pittance, with no healthcare, no decent education, not even a hint of a pension - so it's not surprising that the one hot meal you eat a day you eat off your lap. That's where the food system becomes a lifestyle.\"</p><p>Much of the broad argument in Stuffed and Starved will be familiar to those who have followed the debate on globalisation - how the liberalisation of trade has created a vast global market for heavily subsidised American and European agricultural products at the expense of local growers in the developing world; how relentless pressure to drive down food prices over 30 years has seen rich ecosystems replaced by monocultures that rely on oil-powered machines, chemical fertilisers and pesticides to drive up yields; and how international corporations and supermarkets that control the flow of technologies and of food itself have been the beneficiaries. It is a portrait of the agro-economics of the madhouse. \"While we think our food is made for us, we are in fact being made for our food,\" he says.</p><p>Take India, which he describes as a storm of contradictions. \"India has the most people in the Forbes top 10 billionaires list, but in the past decade the average calorie intake of the poorest has fallen. There are levels of hunger we haven't seen since the British left, combined with the world's highest levels of type 2 diabetes from the pressure of eating too much of the wrong kinds of food.\"</p><p>Or take the UK, where food producers are now less than one per cent of the workforce. The government may be committed to reducing global warming emissions, but meanwhile a quarter of all trucks on UK roads are carrying food and the average British family is driving 136 miles a year to buy it.</p><p>Or America. This is the country whose farmers, food giants and supermarkets benefit most from the global system. Such is the might of US food corporations that the double arches of McDonald's are more widely recognised as a symbol than the cross. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer not only in the US, but also in Mexico where Walmex takes in three out of every 10 pesos Mexicans spend on food. Yet amid such largesse 35 million Americans don't know where their next meal is coming from. \"You are hearing these amazing stories of working American families adopting coping strategies that I learned about in development sociology - skipping meals, growing their own fruit and vegetables, giving up on meat. That's happening right here right now.\"</p><p>Which brings us back to the current food crisis. What surprised him, he says, is not that the food system felt a gentle jolt - after all, he predicted it - but that it has been pummelled all at once by a perfect storm of troubles. \"We could have seen it coming because of the biofuels policy, which has always struck me as absurd, or the rising price of oil, or increased consumption of meat, or weird things happening with climate. But all these things happened at once, and that sent food prices through the roof.\"</p><p>And this time, there were none of the safeguards of grain stores, strategic food reserves, or import barriers that used to protect vulnerable economies from the vagaries of world markets. They had all been removed in the liberalisation craze of the past few decades. </p><p>His prognosis is that in the short term at least the crisis will carry on biting. Major institutions such as the World Bank persist, he says, in responding to events with the same failed policies of liberalisation of markets. \"There's no reason why food prices should come down significantly. And if they don't, and there's no real impetus for governments to redistribute spending power, people will continue to take to the streets.\"</p><p>In the medium term, he's confident that change is in the air. He detects a growing seriousness and willingness to embrace new ideas in some unexpected quarters. The reason we are chatting in a DC restaurant is that Patel has just that morning been giving testimony before a Congressional committee investigating the World Bank's approach to food and development. With representatives from the World Bank, UN, Monsanto and other monoliths listening in, he told the committee that industrial agriculture could no longer be relied upon to feed the world and that we need a shift towards less fossil-fuel dependent farming and a return to rich ecosystems based on natural crop rotations and organic fertilisers. \"Those are the kinds of things that are anathema to the World Bank and development analysts at the moment, and Congress normally doesn't want to hear them. That they called on someone like me is very weird, but very heartening.\"</p><p>In the longer term, though, even the current food crisis may seem mild. The world population is set to rise from about six billion today to nine billion by 2050. Global warming is likely to disrupt growing patterns and extend drought across Africa and the American south-west. Water resources for irrigation will be depleted. If we are already in a perfect storm, then we lack the terminology to describe what lies ahead.</p><p>I put it to him that any attempt to change world food production is like a game of poker with extraordinarily high stakes: it not only has to meet the massive yield of industrial farming - and say what you like about the modern food system, the one thing it has done is churn out mountains of the stuff relatively cheaply - it also has to raise it to support three billion extra hungry mouths. Can his alternative model achieve that?</p><p>\"We've got an energy problem, a fuel problem, a water problem and global warming all coming at us,\" he replies. \"Monoculture is heavily C02-emitting, water and fossil-fuel dependent. Clearly we can't carry on as we are. We can and we must meet this challenge with something new. So the question is what?\"</p><p>That's not entirely an answer to my question. There is a slightly starry-eyed quality to Stuffed and Starved that is also striking about its author in the flesh. When he talks of alternative farming techniques that offer a way forward, the examples he chooses come from Cuba, Venezuela and a project in Oakland that follows in the footsteps of the Black Panthers. That's hardly going to play well with sceptical American policy-makers.</p><p>The other element that is lacking from his prognosis is any role for science and technological innovation in the search for solutions. Where technology does appear it is in the role of villain - GM crops are a ruse by Monsanto and others to secure corporate profits at the expense of the rural poor. </p><p>But isn't there a place for responsibly directed science in steering us through the coming maelstrom? Couldn't GM, for instance, prove to be crucial in developing drought-resistant crops as global warming tightens its grip?</p><p>\"I'm big on science, married to a neuroscientist, I love it,\" he insists, protesting perhaps a little too much. \"I like the way Cuban science approaches the problem. They say you can have GM crops if you can prove there's no better way of doing things. So they don't have GM crops, because there always is a better way.\"</p><p>Not exactly a ringing endorsement for the value of science. But then that is not where Patel's heart lies. For that you have to look to politics, and political resistance. The soothsayer's next book, he says, will be a look at the individuals and communities who are refusing to bow down to the current global system. He will soon be starting another journey to meet them. On his list: the slum-dwellers of Durban and the homeless Americans who run the University of the Poor. He sees in them a lesson for us all. \"We are victims,\" he says as he polishes off his pizza and prepares to fly back to San Francisco where he now lives. \"If we are choosing between Coke or Pepsi, Burger King or McDonald's, that's not choice. We should stop feeling guilty about that. We should start feeling angry\".</p><p><em><strong>&#183;</strong> Stuffed &amp; Starved is published by Portobello and available from the <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846270116\">Guardian bookshop</a> at £8.99 + p&amp;p </em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/07/28/food84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/29/food.climatechange","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/jul/29/food.climatechange","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Jonathan Glennie: we should moderate calls for aid","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-24T15:41:23Z","sectionId":"katine","id":"katine/2008/jul/24/africaaid.background","fields":{"body":"<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is poor. If rich countries send it money it will be less poor and people living in poverty will be better off. It seems perfectly logical, doesn't it? Moved by persistent poverty in Africa, millions of people have joined campaigns to persuade their governments to give more aid to Africa. But it is not that simple.</p><p>Our focus on increasing aid is obscuring the far more important things that rich governments can do to help end poverty in Africa. And while aid often does a lot of good, when we look at all of aid's impacts, not just the positive side of the balance sheet, the picture becomes less black and white. And less rosy.</p><p>Not even the most optimistic of aid's advocates believe aid is that important for African development. Yet somehow it always emerges as the campaign of choice when we want our governments to do something. Far more money flows out of Africa each year than arrives there in aid, but where are the campaigns to stem illegal capital flows going through tax havens?</p><p>Rich countries need to overhaul the rules on international property rights and foreign investment. They should act on climate change and invest more in transferable technology. They should regulate better an arms trade causing turmoil in Africa, among many other things.</p><p>By constantly focusing on aid, we are letting developed country governments off the hook on these issues, all of which are more important for poverty reduction and democracy in Africa. Campaigners can muster a limited amount of political capital. We should not be spending it on aid.</p><p>The other reason for moderating our calls for more aid is its ambiguous impact for the poor in many countries. Aid can do good. Emergency aid is often the only way to respond to crises, and development aid spent well can be life-saving and life-changing. Millions of children in Burundi, Malawi and Kenya are going to school free of charge, helped by aid. Vaccination programmes against diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and river blindness are among the most conspicuous of aid's successes. And infrastructure can be improved. Botswana used aid wisely to spur growth and poverty reduction (before HIV/Aids struck).</p><p>So we should not be pessimistic about the good aid can do – it will always play a helpful accompanying role. But nor should we be naïve about what is achievable by scaling it up. We need to be realistic about aid's impacts, not least so that we don't raise expectations too much. Botswana is an exception in Africa. Good news stories are only one side of the aid coin.</p><p>Official aid to Africa (that is aid given by governments as distinct from private charity giving) also has negative impacts that, far from helping poor people, have often meant more poverty, more hunger, worse basic services and damage to already precarious democratic institutions. Do these negative impacts outweigh the good done by aid? Some people, including many African campaigners, believe the answer is often yes.</p><p>Why? Donor governments attach strings to their aid. Across Africa, aid-dependent countries have been pressurised into implementing policies that have weakened their capacity to reduce poverty and have, ironically, made them even more reliant on aid. From cashew farmers in Mozambique to cotton workers in Kenya, key industries have been devastated by these aid conditions. While aid is helping African children to attend school on the one hand, aid conditions have weakened African businesses on the other, putting hundreds of thousands of parents out of work.</p><p>Some aspects of aid giving have improved in the last decade. But with a few exceptions (including, on good days, a rather contradictory UK government), donors are still using aid to pursue their own strategic interests and are resisting calls to reform. Should Africans continue to accept a raw deal, or are there better ways of financing development? Increasingly, analysts are suggesting that there are.</p><p>Aid dependency has also undermined the accountability of the African state to its citizens. African voters and civil society organisations complain that their governments, now in their third decade of heavy aid dependence, are not accountable to them. When governments rely more on aid than taxes, they listen more to donors than taxpayers.</p><p>The effectiveness of Africa's civil institutions has also been affected, with policymakers growing used to having their ideas rejected by donors. Analysts talk of a 'policy vacuum' at the heart of the Tanzanian government, describe Ghana's budget as a 'deceptive mirage', and identify a 'mentality of aid dependency' in Mali, leading to the loss of the 'habit, capacity, and incentives to set up and implement their own policies.' This problem could worsen if, as donors promise, aid as a percentage of recipient government budgets increases yet further.</p><p>A balance has to be struck between filling the financing gap and fostering the development of mature democratic institutions. That could mean reducing aid in some cases and focusing on other types of development funding. Aid is complex.

Pared down to its essentials, the west would provide money in the form of aid, debt relief and lower trade barriers; in return, Africa would govern itself better.</p><p>Since then the mood has become more pessimistic and it's easy to see why: the failure of the west to pony up the promised cash; the growing threat of climate change; rising food prices and widespread hunger; the violence in Kenya; the desperate situation in Zimbabwe; Darfur. Yet, without under-estimating these immense challenges, there are reasons to remain hopeful.</p><p>For one thing, it is going to be hard for the laggards of the G8 to wriggle out of their promises, particularly after last week's EU summit agreed to an Agenda for Action and reaffirmed Europe's aid commitment for 2010.</p><p>Gordon Brown, with the active support of George Bush and the rather more discreet backing of Angela Merkel, has been stressing just how crucial 2008 will be if there is to be any chance of hitting the 2015 development goals set by the United Nations. Last week's annual progress report on Gleneagles from Data - the NGO set up by Bob Geldof and Bono - also highlighted just how far off track some countries are from the promise to boost aid to Africa by more than $20bn (&pound;10bn) by 2010.</p><p>The four Bs - Brown, Bush, Bob and Bono - make a formidable ginger group.</p><p>Another reason for optimism is that the extra financial resources, where they have been delivered, have helped. The Data report notes that debt relief has enabled poor countries to increase the share of government funds allocated to poverty reduction from 37.8% in 2000 to 55.1% in 2007 - a rise of $14bn. In practice, that has meant more children in schools, enhanced immunisation programmes and more people being treated for HIV/Aids.</p><p>Then, apart from Zimbabwe, the continent has seen a move towards democratic government and away from conflict. The hard evidence shows that those countries which have had the best governance have also had the best records for reducing poverty.</p><p>The simplistic notion that there is a \"magic bullet\" for development, be it the invisible hand of the market, faster growth or a massive increase in aid, has been rightly challenged. An example of the new thinking comes in a book by Duncan Green, head of research at Oxfam GB, which confronts the view that progress in poor countries is predominantly driven by what happens in rich countries. Green argues that the key to development is having an effective state that is held to account by its active citizenry. This makes a great deal of sense.</p><p>Sustained development will be achieved only if progressive states operate the rule of law, improve the physical infrastructure, invest in human capital and - crucially - adopt measures to ensure that the fruits of growth are shared more evenly. Belated though it is, the recognition that inequality acts as a significant brake on development is welcome.</p><p>Green notes: \"Now it is clearer than ever that the only way to end the gross inequalities that have condemned more than a billion people to linger in poverty is through a massive redistribution of power, assets and opportunities.\"</p><p>The lesson of the past few decades is that those countries which have ensured health and education for all, and which have actively managed the growth process - nations such as South Korea, Mauritius and Botswana - have succeeded whereas those which have seen the strength of the state sapped have struggled. The old Washington consensus notion that a \"rising tide lifts all boats\" is no longer fashionable, even in Washington.</p><p>In its recent report, the Commission on Growth and Development, set up with World Bank support, strongly backed a commitment to giving everyone a \"fair chance\" to enjoy the fruits of growth. \"But equal opportunities are no guarantee of equal outcomes,\" the report added. \"Governments should seek to contain this inequality at the bottom and top end of the income spectrum. Otherwise, the economy's progress may be jeopardised by divisive politics, protest, and even violent conflict. If the ethical case does not persuade, the pragmatic one should.\"</p><p>Having said all this, massive challenges remain. The one billion people living in extreme poverty, the needless deaths, the children out of school, the growing technology gap between Africa and the rest of the world, and the continent's acute vulnerability to natural disasters all pose real threats. Here, then, are some tentative suggestions for what should happen next.</p><p>The first is that the G8 put its own house in order. That doesn't just mean meeting its aid commitments but also taking inequality seriously in their own countries and walking the walk on climate change.</p><p>The second is to accept that the course of building effective developmental states is going to be a long and hard process. While it may be vital in the short term to tackle pandemics and famines, in the long term there needs to be far more focus on the building blocks of development. Two vital areas - water and sanitation, and agriculture - have been woefully neglected by western donors; that omission needs to be rectified fast. Clean water, for example, makes it a lot easier to cut infant mortality and raise educational standards.</p><p>There also needs to be a recognition that poor countries often lack the basic skills that keep western economies ticking over: management expertise, effective administrations at national and local level and an adequately trained workforce.</p><p>Finally, there is a case for rapid and massive technology transfer to help the poorest countries cope with a climate change problem that they have done little or nothing to cause. The west may want to turn a blind eye, but the upshot would be greater migratory pressure, higher food prices and - almost certainly - a breeding ground for terrorism. </p><p>Again, if the ethical argument does not persuade, the pragmatic one should.</p><p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@guardian.co.uk\">larry.elliott@guardian.co.uk</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/23/economics.g8","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/jun/23/economics.g8","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Can biotechnology feed Africa?","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-20T13:43:29Z","sectionId":"society","id":"society/katineblog/2008/jun/20/canbiotechnologyfeedafrica","fields":{"body":"<p><img src=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2008/06/20/Katine-GM-crops-1.jpg\"/> <span class=\"caption\">Katine farmer Paul Odongo ploughing his land. Photograph: Dan Chung</span></p><p>It seems the perfect answer: use scientific advance to develop food crops such as bananas and maize that are capable of resisting the pests, diseases and the vagaries of the rainfall that each year threaten the survival of many of sub-Saharan Africa's small farmers. This, surely, is the key to unlocking its green revolution - and preventing another <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/food\">food crisis</a></strong> like the current one.</p><p>Where the rest of the world has seen an explosion in agricultural productivity that has mainly outstripped population growth, Africa produces less food per capita now than it did in 1960. The average <strong><a href=\"http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/agriculture-food/country-profile-186.html\">calorie consumption</a></strong> is about 600 calories less than required. In some parts of Africa, as much as a third of the population are reliant on some degree of food aid. About 40 years of structural transformation has yielded almost <strong><a href=\"http://www.nationmedia.com/eastafrican/current/Business/biz1404200887.htm\">no growth</a></strong>.</p><p>Poor soils, increasing salinity, and lack of security are part of the story. But the damage that diseases and pests inflict on crops and livestock is a significant problem. For example, the infestation of maize by a <strong><a href=\"http://www.africancrops.net/news/dec06/striga_eradication.htm\">parasitic weed called striga</a></strong> has spread to over a million hectares of Africa's precious grainlands. The East African banana, another vital food source, is attacked by fungi such as black leaf strike and banana wilt, which is creeping south across the Great Lakes region.</p><p>Global warming poses another threat. Already farmers are complaining of infrequent and variable rainfalls which the <strong><a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/article/detail/14404\">latest research</a></strong> suggests will lead to somewhere between a 17% and a 30% fall in productivity before the end of the century. The difference depends on the use of carbon fertilisers. But they are major contributors to global warming.</p><p>Biotechnology seems to offer some protection from these challenges. But doubts persist not only about its safety, which has led to some African countries banning the import of genetically modified maize and soya (as well as Europe refusing to take GM exports), but also about its usefulness in building food security. Africa has been a slow and reluctant recruit to the <strong><a href=\"http://www.freshplaza.com/news_detail.asp?id=19625\">biotech revolution</a></strong>.</p><p>One reason is that technological advances in agriculture are largely done by big business for big farmers. Biotechnology is expensive to develop, and the companies involved such as Monsanto want big returns. Only large-scale commercial farms can afford the investment, particularly when the product is accompanied by licences that restrict its sale and further use. The so-called 'terminator' strategy - now less common - made it impossible to hold back seed for the following year's sowing.</p><p>When a new technology is successful on a wide scale it has the effect of forcing smaller producers into the same game. The commercial dominance of the new drives out the diversity of the old, even though it is variety that small producers need to get the most from their land for the lowest inputs. They find themselves forced into a relationship they can't afford with the corporate sector.</p><p>Commercial farming carries a high level of risk for a small grower. Relying on a single crop makes them highly vulnerable to drought and flood, while a variety of produce sown at varying times gives at least some resilience. If the worst happens, small producers find themselves in debt, with nothing either to sell or to eat. Far from enhancing food security, it destroys it.</p><p>Part of the answer is to reduce the cost of technological advance. That means rebuilding public research centres from the ruins of the privatisations of the 1990s enforced by World Bank economists demanding reform in return for loans. This is now happening across Africa. In Uganda, for example, trials are underway for a <strong><a href=\"http://www.promusa.org\">genetically-altered banana variety</a></strong> that will resist black leaf wilt.</p><p>Bananas are particularly vulnerable to pest and disease epidemics because there are few genetic variations - they propagate by cloning through suckers. But this also means they are safer for genetic modification because there is little risk of them spreading the modification unintentionally through cross-pollination.</p><p>But like many African countries, Uganda has allowed its infrastructure of agricultural 'extension' workers - trained agronomists who relay developments from research centre to the farmer, and report on farmers' needs to the researchers - to fall apart. It is the commercial sector that has developed a marketing network in rural areas, not government, and its objective is profitability rather than poverty alleviation.</p><p>Nonetheless experiments and <strong><a href=\"http://www.codesria.org/Links/conferences/ifs/Macauley.pdf\">trials in GM crops are now underway across Africa</a></strong>, in countries including Kenya, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Senegal and Burkina Faso. They have ratified the Cartagena Protocol on <strong><a href=\"http://www.cbd.int/biosafety\">biosafety</a></strong> and are developing their research and development capacity.</p><p>But outside agribusiness, there are few believers in the transformative powers of biotechnology. Equally few rule it out altogether. This week the UK government - unlike the US - accepted the report of the UN-backed <strong><a href=\"www.agassessment.org\">International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development</a></strong> (IAASTD) from its meeting in Johannesburg in April.</p><p>This body of American, European and African scientists recommended a completely different approach to stimulating an African green revolution. Its report is the latest in a growing body of research that says the smallholder is the key to unlocking Africa's agricultural potential and building food security.</p><p>This is the agricology approach. As <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/mar/20/livelihoods.katinepartners\">Farm-Africa seeks to do in Katine</a></strong>, it believes that the men and women who work the land are the people who know what problems need to be solved, and in what order. The challenge is to find ways of channelling their knowledge into research and the results back out into rural communities - and the funding to do it.</p><p>GM crops may one day be part of the answer. They must not be allowed to become part of the problem first.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/katineblog/2008/jun/20/canbiotechnologyfeedafrica","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/katineblog/2008/jun/20/canbiotechnologyfeedafrica","sectionName":"Society"},{"webTitle":"The Friday interview: Jochen Zeitz","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-19T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2008/jun/20/manufacturing.germany","fields":{"body":"<p>As the day wore on, the streets of Basle turned to rivers of red, filled with braying football fans wrapped in Swiss and Turkish flags.</p><p>Jochen Zeitz, the head of Puma, arrived in the early afternoon for a few meetings and then headed off to the match. For Puma, the European Championship is a huge opportunity. The sportswear and fashion group sponsors five of the competing teams, including the hosts, Switzerland and Austria. Many of the fans meandering through the streets were wearing Swiss football shirts with the Puma logo.</p><p>Puma is the world's third-largest sportswear maker, with about 6% of the market, some way behind Adidas and Nike, which have a combined 60%. The company, which has sponsored the likes of Pele, Diego Maradona and Kenny Dalglish, dropped off the pace for many years, but has begun to spend big in football again, re-establishing credibility at the most recent World Cup, where it sponsored 12 squads, including the winners, Italy.</p><p>\"Some of the greatest stars in the history of football have been under contract with Puma,\" Zeitz says. \"Our specific goal is to grow our business again and to close the gap with the two leading brands.\" </p><p>On this occasion, things would not work out quite as planned. The Swiss fell to defeat on a sodden pitch and were bundled out of the tournament after only four days of competition.</p><p>Puma was famously founded when the Dassler brothers parted ways in the 1940s - one going on to form Puma and the other Adidas. When Zeitz took over at Puma in 1993 it had seen far better days. He was the fourth chief executive in as many years. The company had made losses for eight years straight and was saddled with debt. He was 30, the youngest boss of a listed company in Europe, quickly establishing a reputation as a wunderkind in Germany's conservative corporate establishment.</p><p>He rebuilt the firm into a profitable business with an enviable cachet and increased sales fivefold to &euro;2.4bn (&pound;1.9bn). Last year Puma caught the eye of Fran&ccedil;ois Pinault's PPR, the French luxury goods group that owns Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Stella McCartney. PPR paid more than &euro;3bn for a 64% stake and Pinault, who had once tried to hire Zeitz to run Gucci, now sits on the Puma board.</p><p>A marathon runner, Zeitz is tall and lean with coat-hanger shoulders, sandy hair and blue eyes. He is in his trademark look, an open-necked white shirt and black suit, finished of course with a pair of dark grey Pumas, from the Rudolph Dassler collection, named after the company founder. I imagine him to be an Imelda Marcos, with racks of trainers in a walk-in wardrobe. \"Not really. The problem is you can't wear your old shoes too often because people say 'you're still wearing that shoe?'.\" The older models he just gives away.</p><p>Zeitz got his opportunity when, as marketing manager, he was asked to make a presentation to the main shareholders, a Swedish firm. \"If it had been a German shareholder forget about it,\" he says. \"I don't think they would ever have taken the chance. When you look back at the photos, you think, Jesus, I was so young. How can anyone give me so much responsibility? But at the time I didn't feel scared or anything. I was just very excited.\"</p><p>The fearlessness was apparent. Production was shifted to Asia, bureaucracy stripped away, costs slashed and the workforce cut almost in half. He made English the corporate language.</p><p>Zeitz, now 44, crafted a cool, rebellious image for the brand. It helped that Puma had a vintage feel. It was taken up by hipsters who snapped up its classic suede shoes and bowling bags. Was that simple good fortune? Zietz thinks not. \"There are 100,000 brands with heritage and history that never come back. It was a wonderful brand for a long period of time. It just needed to be re-awoken.\"</p><p>When Madonna appeared on a magazine cover in customised Pumas with three-inch heels, the company produced a line copying her style. Zeitz sponsored the Berlin Love Parade, a rave festival, and the Skateboarding World Cup. Puma produced an eye-catching catsuit for tennis player Serena Williams and a one-piece strip for the Cameroon football team, with red shorts attached to a skin-tight green top, which was banned by the international federation. </p><p>Zeitz denies the outfit was a gimmick. \"We are trying to constantly innovate. You can do that through technology, you can do that through shape and in that case we did both. It was the lightest jersey that has ever been created.\"</p><p>Nearly half the football teams Puma sponsors are African, partly to align itself with the more adventurous play of the African squads and partly one assumes through financial expediency - Puma doesn't have the marketing budget of Nike or Adidas.</p><p>Zeitz says Puma was the first to understand that the lines between fashion and sport were blurring. Jil Sander contacted the company to use the classic Pele boot in a fashion show. Zeitz was thrilled and encouraged her to produce a line for Puma. Collaborations followed with designers Alexander McQueen and Philippe Starck, model Christy Turlington and jeans maker Evisu.</p><p>This year Zeitz appointed the British designer Hussein Chalayan, renowned for theatrically stunning but often unwearable pieces, as creative director. Puma acquired a stake in his business. \"We always try to do extraordinary things and push the boundaries. I think this is now his opportunity to prove he can be a meaningful designer not just from a conceptual point of view but as somebody who can create products that can be worn and that people can buy, and that's his ambition.\"</p><p>Zeitz praises PPR's strategic thinking and brand-building as well as the autonomy it gives each division. The relationship has been \"nothing but positive\". </p><p>The press cuttings portray Zeitz as a colourful character. I ask about his wild boar hunting, which draws a sigh. \"I haven't been hunting for years. It is just a tradition I grew up with.\" He rubbishes the idea that he is a party animal, though he did hit Las Vegas with Brad Pitt as part of an effort to woo Hollywood stars in the late 90s. He flies his own plane, has an estate in Africa and speaks seven languages, including Swahili.</p><p>Growth at Puma has slowed. Earnings in the most recent quarter were down from &euro;96.6m a year ago to &euro;90.1m. Sales in the US were 14% lower, which was chiefly put down to the woes of the Foot Locker chain, though Puma is sticking to its forecast of single-digit sales growth this year.  </p><p>Part of Puma's strategy is building its own retail chain. The market has become more difficult as rivals have also collaborated with fashion designers and the 1970s vintage fad has run out of steam. \"When you are small and you have to try and prove yourself, it is tough. When others are catching up and copy you that's tough. We constantly need to change ourselves to stay ahead of the game.\" </p><p>Zeitz recently extended his contract with Puma for another five years but says the growth of the company means he is \"moving more than ever\". After watching the match in Basle, he was heading to Zurich, then back to Germany and then to the US, where he was boarding a Puma-sponsored boat to Bermuda. </p><p>Puma has recently launched its own line of sailing clothes. \"You've got to experience it to understand it.\" Nice part of the job. \"Well,\" he considers, \"it depends on the waves.\"<br/><h2>The CV</h2><p><strong>Born</strong> April 6 1963, Mannheim, Germany</p><p><strong>Family</strong> Married, no children </p><p><strong>Education </strong>Karl-Friedrich Gymnasium, Mannheim; European Business School, Frankfurt, international marketing and finance (1982-86) </p><p><strong>Career</strong> Colgate-Palmolive (1987-90); Puma (1993-present): manager of marketing footwear, 1990-91; head of marketing, 1991-92; vice-president of international marketing and sales, 1992-93; CEO and chairman of the board, 1993-present.

But to people in the developing world, the arrival of mobile banking - or m-banking - is potentially revolutionary.</p><p>If money is an economy's lifeblood, improving its circulation plays a critical role. Many Africans living in rural areas, for instance, rely on money sent home by members of their family who work in towns and cities. But getting that cash to a village that could be hundreds of miles away is a tricky business. In Kenya, for example, workers in urban areas hand wages over to bus drivers, who promise to stop off at the worker's home village en route to their destination.</p><p>Even those who do have a bank account - and they make up only a few per cent of Africa's 950 million population - are restricted in what they can do with their money because of the dearth of branches in rural areas.</p><p>But the dramatic growth in mobile phone use in Africa - phones now outnumber cash machines by several thousand to one - is paving the way for a new set of services that turn the humble handset into a banking tool with the potential to transform Africa's economy.</p><p>Services have sprung up that let people transfer cash by text message to other mobile phone users and give Africa's vast number of \"unbanked\" their first access to financial products. Instead of using a bank branch, these services rely on local retailers who already sell mobile top-up cards.</p><p>\"We wanted to offer something that would work,\" explained Mung Ki Woo, who heads Orange's m-payments division. \"Instead of giving people a plastic card, why not use something many people already have: a mobile phone? And instead of doing transactions at a bank branch, why not let people go to their local retailer to deposit and withdraw cash?\"</p><p>In March the company, owned by France Telecom, launched Orange Money in Ivory Coast, where only 7% of the population has a bank account, and plans to roll it out into some of its other markets, including Jordan and Mali.</p><p>Orange Money allows people to deposit cash through Orange's network of local retailers and send it to other registered Orange Money customers, who can then withdraw it through their local store. </p><p>Vodafone has moved a step closer to the dream of m-banking with its M-Pesa service. Launched by Vodafone's Safaricom unit in Kenya last year, M-Pesa has well over 2 million customers and adds more than 200,000 new ones every month. Like Orange Money, it uses the network of thousands of local retailers who sell airtime top-up cards to act as a branch network, but registered M-Pesa customers can send their deposited cash to a mobile phone user on any network.</p><p>\"Money transfer has been touted in western Europe as a good idea for some time,\" a Vodafone spokeswoman said. \"But to be honest it has not really caught on because you can already transfer money easily and most people have bank accounts. But in places where there are no banks it has become almost like a necessity.\"</p><p>Orascom - which has operations in Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Zimbabwe - recently announced plans to roll out m-banking across its markets and MTN, the continent's largest mobile phone operator, already has a service up and running in several areas. In South Africa a start-up called Wizzit has been providing mobile banking services, including a debit card, in partnership with a local bank for three years.</p><p>These services will all help put basic banking services within reach of many more African consumers. But a deal last month could dramatically alter the African m-banking landscape and finally close the gap between the banking haves and have-nots.</p><p>UK-based Monitise has spent the past five years developing technology that makes any mobile phone as secure as a cash machine. The company, formerly MChex and spun out of the technology firm Morse last year, has already clinched a crucial deal in the UK with the Link network and several of its partner banks are using the technology for mobile banking services.</p><p>Having proved its technology in one of the world's most advanced banking markets, Monitise has its sights set on Africa. In May it signed a deal with Made In Africa, an organisation co-founded by the designer Ozwald Boateng that is helping spur economic development in the region, to bring its technology to Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Sudan and Zambia.</p><p>Monitise wants to build a service that functions whether or not a person has a bank account, regardless of which bank they use if they do have an account, and that can be accessed by customers of any mobile phone network.</p><p>\"Basically, we are working with the banks to extend their model outwards from the small number of people who have access to banking services into the far larger number of people who have a mobile phone,\" explained its chief executive, Alastair Lukies.</p><p>The basic idea mirrors what operators such as Safaricom and Orange are doing but Monitise also wants to make use of local intermediaries who will go into rural areas, almost as mobile bank branches. Local intermediaries have been very effective in micro-finance, lending small sums to projects in the developing world and ensuring repayments are collected. Monitise hopes to have networks of retailers, operators and banks set up across east Africa later this year but it offers the potential to set up full-scale banking businesses across the continent.</p><p>\"One of the things the banks are waking up to now is micro-finance,\" Lukies explained, \"and 'the unbanked' has gone from being a thing you talk about in the corporate and social responsibility paragraph at the end of the annual report to being a fantastically viable market.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/17/telecoms.telecoms","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/jun/17/telecoms.telecoms","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Joseph Stiglitz: 'I am not a pessimist'","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-03T08:00:00Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2008/jun/03/economics","fields":{"body":"<p>Founded in 1906 on the southern shores of Lake Michigan, Gary is a steel city that reflects the history of industrialisation in the United States, much like Sheffield in England. I grew up in Gary, Indiana, a city marked by high levels of inequality, discrimination and periodic unemployment. My initial concerns about the economic iniquities and social injustices in the States, and later in the rest of the world, stem in part from my early life in Gary. </p><p>I was a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1963 to 1967, the Kennedy era, which was marked by concerns about civil rights as well as poverty. While President Johnson's \"war on poverty\" focused on poverty in the US, Kennedy had awakened a new interest in problems of poverty in developing countries. Everybody at MIT cared deeply about what could be done to enhance economic growth in developing countries. There was a new mood that, unfortunately, seems to have faded away after those heady and idealistic years. </p><p>While I was completing my graduate work in 1967, the opportunity arose to go to India and Thailand, and that's where I experienced at first hand a little of what was going on in the third world. After that I spent some time in Kenya through the Rockefeller Foundation, and that's when I really became engaged in the problems of developing countries.</p><p>These travels ultimately fed my theoretical thinking. The standard economic theory that I and everyone else had been taught had certain predictions, but those predictions were inconsistent with the real world. It was the contradiction between what I had seen in the outside world and what academia had taught me that led me to see something wrong in standard economic theory. So I developed a new theory, based on the simple premise that uncertainty and poor information can help explain how and why markets fail (for which in 2001 I received the Nobel memorial prize in economics). <br /> <br />As I explored the \"economics of information\" it became increasingly clear that it constituted a new paradigm, a revolutionary change in the way people had thought about economics for over 200 years, at least since the time of Adam Smith. Markets were shown not to be as efficient as was widely believed – and there was a fundamental role for government. </p><p>The theory explained how there could be persistent unemployment or discrimination. In itself, of course, the theory doesn't provide the answers to all the problems that originally motivated me to come into economics, but it does provide some of the intellectual foundations for research that can help us address those issues. The work of development and trying to understand why poor countries have remained poor for so long (and what we can do to help them) is a part of my work that makes me most proud.</p><p>In many respects the current credit crunch turmoil illustrates many of the principles that my work on the economics of information helped to elucidate. These problems simply could not have arisen in the world of perfect information. At the same time, it provides a test of these theories. One of my most important articles was a paper I wrote with Andy Weiss in 1981 called \"Credit Rationing in Markets with Imperfect Information\" (American Economic Review). Before that, economic theory had said that there was no such thing as a credit crunch – it never existed because \"demand equals supply\". I explained why this might not be true and why a credit crunch might well arise.</p><p>Nowadays, the phrase that you often hear discussed is \"lack of transparency\", which is just another way of saying \"lack of information\". The problem is that there are incentives to engage in non-transparent activities. And that is exactly one of the questions my research investigated – that is, the incentive not only for honesty but equally for dishonesty, and not only for providing good information, but also for providing bad information. My research helped to increase awareness of conflicts of interest and perverse incentives – problems that have to be addressed if we are to make markets work better. </p><p>My work was the first to analyse, in a rigorous way, the whole theory of incentives. With perfect information you don't need incentives, you just get paid for doing what you do. The whole theory of incentives is based on the theory of information: conflicts of interest arise when individuals' incentives differ from the interests of those whom they are supposed to serve. In a sense, all of these problems are applications of the general theory that I developed. </p><p>Another example is the issue of corporate governance, which has received so much attention in recent years. One of the key problems is that managers often act in their own interests, which may differ from those of shareholders or other stakeholders. Before the development of the new paradigm on the economics of information, people didn't have any language for discussing these issues effectively, nor any way of seeing the problem in these broad terms. Terms like \"moral hazard\" had existed in specialist insurance literature, but since my theoretical work these words have entered our common language.  </p><p>My Iraq book, The Three Trillion Dollar War, doesn't represent a theoretical breakthrough. It does, however, expose what had hitherto been absent from the public domain: the true cost of the Iraq war. Just as there was deception about the reasons for going to war with Iraq – no weapons of mass destruction, no connection with 9/11 and no al-Qaida in Iraq – there is also grave deception about the economic cost of the war.</p><p>My co-author Linda Bilmes (a Public Policy lecturer at Harvard) and I have been against the war from the start. We have been open about this, and that is why we were careful to rely on numbers that were publicly verifiable and, when there was some ambiguity, were very conservative in our estimates – the figure is in fact probably more like $4-5tn.</p><p>The book is concerned with the most important global societal problem of today. In assessing the costs of the war there are some complex issues, but we tried to explain these issues in understandable terms. The fact that I have been able to contribute in some way to changing the debate on the war, I feel is important. One of the reasons for writing the book is because we wanted to stimulate a discussion – and this, I believe, we have done. The war has stimulated a discussion of our priorities and values – also our political processes, including deficiencies in how funds are appropriated and lack of transparency in what the war is costing. It is ironic that while we said that we went to war for democracy, in the way the Bush administration has conducted the war, we have clearly not lived up to our ideals.</p><p>In US terms I am a Democrat, but in European terms I would say that I'm a social democrat. I think that European social democratic philosophy represents several aspects of my political beliefs: that there is an important role for government but also an important role for the private sector. We are trying to figure out a balanced role for both. The government in particular has to promote social justice and social solidarity. Market forces don't solve that kind of problem. We are also becoming aware of the importance of people working together, voluntarily, to address societal needs. </p><p>We have to work towards more effective democratic participation. There are political failures just as there are market failures, and in some sense the voices of certain groups don't get heard adequately. So I view myself as working not only to understand why markets don't work, but also why political processes don't work and what we can do to make markets work better and to make political processes work better. And here, part of the sense of \"working better\" is to be more representative of society. </p><p>Overall, I would say that I am an optimist. However, anybody who woke up after the US presidential election of 2004 and the return of George Bush would have felt frustrated. It seemed so obvious that America, and the world, was in for a difficult period. We needed someone who understood the importance of multilateralism, global warming, human rights – or even the basic principles of economics. He had already demonstrated his lack of a grasp of these fundamentals. </p><p>Somebody looking at my doom and gloom forecasts might say that I am a real pessimist. What makes me an optimist is that I am still hopeful. We are about to turn the corner! America has a chance to correct its mistake of 2004. I am hopeful – both for my sake and for the world's – that in November we will show greater wisdom than we did four years ago.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/03/economics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/jun/03/economics","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Africa news round-up – 30.5.08","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-30T11:01:17Z","sectionId":"katine","id":"katine/2008/may/30/katineamref.news","fields":{"body":"<p>The leader of the Lord's Resistance Army will be tracked down and arrested, regardless of opposition to the move in Uganda, the new head of the International Criminal Court told <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200805300004.html\">The Monitor</a></strong> newspaper.</p><p>Silvana Arbia told the paper last week that the arrest of Joseph Kony and two of his commanders was \"expected\". She added that the warrants for war crimes, including murder and rape, had been served to the \"concerned states for their enforcement\", which was an obligation they must fulfil. The warrants were issued in 2005 and details of them were sent to Uganda, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the LRA has been active.</p><p>Arbia said the ICC would not consider withdrawing the warrants even if the Ugandan government promised to try the rebel leaders at a specially convened court in Uganda. She denied that the ICC was to blame for the failure of peace talks this year between the LRA and ministers. The LRA has said it will not sign a peace deal unless the warrants are withdrawn.</p><p>The arrest warrant for Kony has polarised opinion in Uganda, with many believing that justice should be delivered locally by those who have been affected by the LRA's 20-year war in the north of the country. The government's inability to end the fighting is being seen as a major failing of the president, Yoweri Museveni, who is now pushing for the warrants to be withdrawn so stability can be restored in the area in good time before for the next national elections in 2011.</p><p>The Ugandan government was this week criticised by donors for not doing enough to tackle corruption in the health sector. According to a report in the <strong><a href=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/630704\">New Vision</a></strong>, chairman of the Health Development Partners, Marc Denys, said that instead of asking for more funds, ministers should develop a \"clear and realistic planning strategy\" for spending the money and hold managers to account for their actions.</p><p>A report published two years ago by the Ogoola Commission found widespread corruption in the health service, with funds diverted and no proper accountability for the $43.3m the government received. According to New Vision, no one has been prosecuted for any wrongdoing.</p><p>\"Health centres do not receive the necessary amount of drugs. People are appointed to health centres, but never report to work. They are paid to do the job, but they do not do it. Nobody blames them and there are no corrective actions: that is corruption,\" said Denys.</p><p>He said the government needed to ensure staff turned up for work and \"address the lack of condoms and Aids drugs\" available in the country. The health minister, Richard Nduhuura, said the ministry was \"committed\" to improving the sector.</p><p>The Ugandan president was this week reported to be happy about the global food crisis because it provided an opportunity for Africans to produce more and show Europeans what they can do. Speaking at the Tokyo international conference on African development, Museveni urged African leaders to mobilise their people to take advantage of the crisis.</p><p>\"If we cannot produce sophisticated machines, why don't we produce food? If we cannot produce anything, then what are we for?\" he said. According to <strong><a href=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/630707\">reports</a></strong>, the president added that Africa's food production was undermined by European policies, which included blocking its markets to products from the continent.</p><p>During the conference Museveni received assurances from the Japan International Cooperation Agency that it would pay for the construction of a bridge over the River Nile in Jinja, north of Kampala, and would establish in Uganda a rice research centre for Africa to bolster production of the crop.</p><p>African development is expected to feature high on the agenda at the next G8 summit to be held in Japan in July.</p><p>At this week's conference in Yokohama, Japan was praised by leaders for its \"strong commitment to Africa's development\", having established the forum, held every five years, in 1993. Delegates from the 52 African states, 22 donor nations and the EU, and from 12 Asian countries have attended the conference, which ends today.</p><p>However, Japan, the world's second largest economy, has been criticised for not setting a deadline for achieving the UN target of spending 0.7% of its gross national income on official development assistance (ODA), although the country has said it is committed to achieving the goal.</p><p>Conference delegates were also told of a $92m initiative between Japan and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to help Africa tackle global warming. The joint programme, which will be launched in August, will help governments adapt their poverty reduction strategies to consider the effects of climate change on development.</p><p>\"Climate change is one of the most critical issues that governments and citizens around the world need to address,\" said Olav Kjorven, UNDP assistant administrator and director of the Bureau for Development Policy. He added that climate change would result in many African countries experiencing \"increased water scarcity and worsened health and food security\".</p><p>Some $11m of the funding will be spent on joint projects with Unicef, the UN's World Food Programme and Industrial Development Organisation.</p><p>A device that could help farmers in Africa increase their crop yields is being tested at Kew Gardens in London. Developed by engineers at the University of Leeds, the sensor device gathers data on air temperature, soil moisture, light, air pressure and humidity, which will help farmers better gauge when to plant, fertilise, irrigate and harvest their crops, and also whether they need to worry about pest and disease control.</p><p>The team from Leeds has been working with two Kenyan villages and academics in the country to develop the device, which is now being tested in the new student vegetable garden at Kew.

Prof Dave Newman of the University of Exeter has created a portable magneto-optical instrument to do the job in a minute. And, when his new method is fully refined, it may not even need a blood sample.</p><p>Newman's expertise as a physicist involves materials for magneto-optical recordable discs. Used since the late 1980s, these rely on measuring a change in laser light reflected from magnetic media in different magnetic states. </p><p>There's also a link between malaria, magnetism and light. Red blood cells are infected by the malarial parasite (Plasmodium) from female Anopheles mosquitoes. The oxygen-carrying haemoglobin is then digested by the parasite, forming haemozoin which exhibits properties of being attracted to magnetic fields.</p><p>Some years ago, Newman had considered researching malaria diagnosis but was prevented by blood safety restrictions. Then he moved to the University of Exeter. \"I went back to this idea and, by talking to a biologist friend of mine, I came to the conclusion that maybe it was possible to detect malaria by detecting the haemozoin by magneto-optics.\"</p><p>Thanks to European Union funding, Newman and colleagues from Exeter and Coventry universities have now tested a prototype instrument at the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam. Clinical trials are also planned in Kenya.  </p><p>It works like this. The parasite produces haemozoin in the form of rectangular rod-like crystals and, normally, the long axes point in random directions. \"When you apply a [magnetic] field to them, they become magnetised and all orientate in the field direction,\" says Newman.</p><p>The crystals also absorb polarised red laser light more strongly along their length than the width (optical dichroism). Put a blood sample into the instrument, apply a directional magnetic field, then a laser and photodetector take optical measurements proportional to the haemozoin concentration. \"The intention is to produce something about the size of a shoe box which will be rugged enough to go out into the field,\" says Newman. </p><p>Colin Sutherland is a senior lecturer at the London School of Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene and a clinical scientist at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. He says that malaria is usually identified with a microscope or by antigen diagnostic kits which may not be too reliable. \"This particular test looks very exciting,\" he says. \"The fact that it's rapid is great but it will, of course, need to be emphasised for a test to be usable by a malaria control programme in Africa, it must be affordable and portable.\"</p><p>Newman is researching a prototype which doesn't use a blood sample. Instead, he envisages putting a finger inside a box within a magnetic field, shining a laser beam onto a fingernail, and taking an optical reading from the blood beneath.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2008/05/28/mosquito140x84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/may/29/research.medicalresearch","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2008/may/29/research.medicalresearch","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Jamie Drummond lobbies the richest people on the planet on behalf of the poorest","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-11T08:33:13Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2008/may/11/development.africa","fields":{"body":"<p>It is unnerving, as a journalist, to travel with Jamie Drummond. He never stops asking questions. In Tanzania, where I spend a week with him, he asks questions of world bank leaders and presidential advisers, of dollar-a-day farmers and fishermen on dhows, of editors and opposition leaders and economists and statisticians and doctors and teachers and nurses. He cheerfully interrogates the sick and the well, schoolchildren and grandmothers. The questions are always local and precise, but they also relate to a bigger enquiry, Drummond's specialised subject: how best to change the world. </p><p>'If we are trying to persuade someone to spend a billion dollars here,' he says, as we drive through the back streets of Dar es Salaam, flooded a foot deep after the rains, on the way to another meeting, 'the very least I can do is never stop being intensely curious as to the way that money should be spent.' Some questions get closer to the heart of things than others. At one point, on a rural road toward the end of a long day, we pass a wooded area in a valley near Kilimanjaro. In the back of the car is a local agronomist. 'What exactly is in the forest?' Drummond asks, with his routine edge-of-the-seat alertness. The agronomist looks out of the window. 'Trees,' she says.</p><p>Drummond, 37, is the executive director of Data (Debt Aids Trade Africa), the organisation he set up six years ago with Bono and Bob Geldof, among others, to lobby the richest people on the planet on behalf of the poorest. While Bono and Geldof have made headlines and met presidents, Drummond has been their representative on earth, driving arguments, making policy, creating access. Data grew out of the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt movement and came of age three years ago in helping to co-ordinate the Make Poverty History campaign, pressuring G8 leaders into signing the historic Gleneagles agreement to double aid to Africa. Since then, Drummond and his team of nearly 100 in London and Washington have been working non-stop in the sometimes losing battle of making sure those signatories honour their promises.</p><p>In this effort, Data has perhaps the most star-studded board of advisers and supporters of any organisation anywhere: it counts Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, George Soros and the guys from Google among its backers; the Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs and Nobel prize winner Amartya Sen as its mentors; and most of A-list Hollywood - Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Matt Damon - as its informal ambassadors. (Drummond resolutely does not drop names, though he will from time to time say something like, 'I was in the mountains of Ethiopia with Brad Pitt when news of his relationship with Angelina Jolie broke. He got drunk with the locals, who had no idea who he was.')</p><p>Data has, through Bono's determined charm and Geldof's anger and the stubborn need to know of Drummond and his team, succeeded in getting its argument into places never before thought possible; in February, George W Bush was in Tanzania with Drummond and Geldof delivering $700m in aid; each of the three potential US presidential candidates has been filmed wearing Data's white <a href=\"http://www.one.org\">One.org</a> wristband and endorsing its policies. However, the currency of Data is not celebrity but information. 'Access doesn't last long if you don't have anything to say,' Drummond says. Hence the questions.</p><p>He has come here by invitation of the Tanzanian president, Jakaya Kikwete, the new leader of the African Union, who met Bono at a conference in New York at the end of last year. Tanzania is something of a laboratory for those who believe that properly directed aid can transform the lives of the world's poorest people. It is, in this sense, the latest in a long line of African countries to assume the media mantle of Most Hopeful Nation. Though 90 per cent of Tanzania's 36m population live on less than &pound;1 a day, the more you travel and talk it is hard not to see an extraordinary extravagance of possibility here: untapped agricultural resources (only 3 per cent of land is irrigated), abundant mineral deposits (including the continent's second-largest gold reserves) and a largely unexploited tourist brochure that includes Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar and the Serengeti. Above all, Tanzania is peaceful, relatively democratic and tolerant - in short, the development agencies' dream. </p><p>As a result it is also currently the biggest recipient of foreign aid in sub-Saharan Africa, this year with $1.8bn in funding from the World Bank, $700m from President Bush's Millennium Challenge Account and enormous investment in health, primarily for Aids and malaria, from the Global Fund. Dfid, the British international development department, is giving &pound;150m in direct aid to Kikwete's government, more than to any other country. When added to aid given through European agencies, that's &pound;5 from each British citizen to each Tanzanian. Data has been at the heart of the lobbying for that unprecedented compact; Drummond wants to prove it is money that can be well spent. If poverty is to be made history anywhere, this seems a good place to start.</p><p>To this end, in his informal tour of duty, Drummond explains what he calls the Data deal. He does this so often that it becomes a kind of single-word mantra. \"We'll-try-to-do-more-about-Debt-Aid-Trade-if-you-do-more-about-Democracy-Accountability-and-Transparency,' he suggests. The second half of that bargain is hard to measure, but some figures stick. Since 2000, when Tanzania was granted $3bn of debt relief, 3m more children have enrolled in the country's primary schools. </p><p>To ensure such momentum can be maintained, Drummond goes in search of evidence of that most elusive of entities: the growth of civil society. He finds it in the person of Sakina Datoo, the editor of the Sunday Citizen, who talks animatedly of holding politicians to account; in Zitto Kabwe, a young opposition spokesman who has given teeth to Parliament by exposing a history of corruption in government mining contracts; and he finds it, too, on school noticeboards, 'talking walls' that explain to parents the resources schools have been promised, the teacher-pupil ratios they should expect, and in homegrown agencies collecting independent statistics of Tanzania's healthcare trends and nurturing women's rights. </p><p>All African development tests an optimist's faith. Drummond argues that it is always about 'moving the chaotic mess of governance slowly in the right direction'. From this perspective the fact that the newspapers are full of stories of corruption, that Kikwete has just removed his prime minister and two of his cabinet for alleged collusion in fraudulent energy deals, is for him the clearest indicator of progress. It is not enough for Drummond to be asking complex questions; all of Tanzania needs to be asking those questions too.</p><p>I have a question: how did Drummond, a man with clear-eyed intelligence, who has retained a backpacker's zeal about the injustice of the world, come by his address book? The answer is that he started with one phone number and went from there.</p><p>Much of the time, sitting in the back of a 4x4 as it bumps along some of the more challenging miles of Tanzania's roads between meetings, the only sound apart from the grind of the gears is that of Drummond's thumbs on his mobile phone, passing news of the world outside the windscreen back to London and Washington; he works in three time zones and his BlackBerry never sleeps. Now he is on the phone to a Japanese minister about the forthcoming Tokyo G8; now he is in touch with Bill Gates's office about a board meeting; now he is listening to Bob Geldof, who wants to talk 'Africa strategy, Asia strategy, Strategy strategy'. (It is, Drummond says, 'always like a double espresso talking to Bob'.) </p><p>This evangelism about connecting different worlds is compulsive. Once, he confesses, during a Davos weekend he had two phones clamped to his head all day, and in the evenings he had to apply ice packs to his burning ears. Several times he has been rendered digitally helpless by repetitive strain injuries, but his thumbs have always come back for more.</p><p>Given this compulsion, it's no surprise that all of this began with a phone call. All development workers have an epiphany, and Drummond's came in 1995, when he was 24 and working for Christian Aid in Ethiopia. It was 10 years after Live Aid and he was on the ground looking at what had changed - the answer was, depressingly little. While &pound;200m in aid was coming in to Ethiopia, double that was always going out to service the debts run up in the ruinous Mengistu dictatorship. Remembering the catalysing spirit and chutzpah of Live Aid, Drummond helped to shape an initiative called Jubilee 2000, which looked to use the celebration of the millennium to give Africa a new start by cancelling billions of dollars of debt. </p><p>By 1997, Drummond had the unenviable task of trying to sell this idea to the White House. There wasn't time, he believed, to do it only through conventional lobbying, so he sought to enlist some alternative support. He had only one good contact. Drummond grew up in west London, where his father was an art dealer, but the family spent every holiday in the west of Ireland, and one of their neighbours there was Chris Blackwell, the legendary boss of Island Records. Through Blackwell, Drummond got a message to Bono. When the singer phoned him, Drummond recalls, his opening line was: 'Hello, this is Bono. Doesn't the economic crisis in south-east Asia make debt cancellation impossible?' Half-thinking it was a mate winding him up with a fake Irish accent, Drummond nevertheless answered the question as best he could, and in so doing began a conversation that a decade later is still very much in progress. Drummond is unerringly modest and anxious at every turn to stress that his was only one small voice in a 'great ecosystem of wonderful development advocacy' - but still, without that call, you could certainly argue that $50bn of debt might never have been written off. </p><p>The genius of Jubilee 2000 was the understanding of how mobile communication and the internet might transform protest. Huge amounts could be achieved cheaply out of one small office. Drummond is explaining how this worked as we drive up to a remote farm in the foothills of the snow-capped volcano Mount Meru, 50 miles west of Kilimanjaro. He is a fan of Google Earth, the software that allows you to telescope in on any spot on the planet, from any other spot. The last time he came up here he was with one of the founders of Google, Larry Page, and the perfectly named Larry Brilliant, the director of their charitable arm, <a href=\"http://www.google.org\">Google.org</a>. They were here to see the joined-up possibilities of working development.</p><p>The Google team came to earth in a farmyard at the top of a fertile valley in Masai country. Loishiye Meshurie lives here with his wife and three children. Meshurie is something of an agrarian revolutionary. He is a pioneer of a plant called artemisia, the so-called 'wonder herb' that can cure malaria. Up until 2005 artemisia only grew in south-east Asia, but with the help of TechnoServe, a charity that teaches best agricultural practice to smallholders, artemisia is now cultivated by 4,000 farmers in this corner of Tanzania. Meshurie walks us round his farm and describes a perfect vision of development in practice: he can sell the crop for a premium; it can be used locally to treat malaria cases (his youngest daughter successfully fought the disease with it); and with the profits he can send his children to school and invest in his farm. Meshurie helps to train 100 other farmers in growing the crop. Since Drummond was last here Meshurie has made an addition to his roof of which he is particularly proud: a $100 solar panel which not only powers a light bulb in the two-room house - the first electricity in the great, quiet valley - it allows him to charge his mobile phone.</p><p>The phone itself represents another crucial strand of progress. On the far hill is a mast; the reception is better here than in parts of London. Drummond loves the neatness of all this. 'Communication is helping the farmers get their products to market, to keep track of prices. It helps clinics get the supply chain of drugs right. Some of it is happening through technology, some through investment.'</p><p>It was this kind of story that, after their visit, prompted <a href=\"http://www.google.org\">Google.org</a> to sponsor a variety of projects that will give people like Loishiye Meshurie more access to knowledge. 'They are working out smart ways to help people at a very local level in places like here, to access statistics about what is really happening in their area - and what should be happening,' Drummond says. And it is a good example, too, of one way that Data has helped to shape investment here. 'One thing we realised was: there are a lot of people at the beginning of the 21st century who are newly extremely wealthy. Particularly on the west coast of America. They have made a lot of money and have changed the world through software or the internet or in investment. Now they want to change the world again. And when someone who is as demanding of results as Bill Gates gets into the sleepy backwater that development had been, it is sure to shake things up.'</p><p>It was Gates who got Data moving. After Jubilee 2000 Drummond was contracted to Oxfam, but his address book by now contained advisers to the G8, heads of state, and all the rightwing republicans that the NGOs found it hard to talk to. He felt, along with Bono and Bobby Shriver, a west coast cousin of the Kennedy clan who had managed to open many doors in Washington, and an inspiring activist called Lucy Matthew, who had worked indefatigably on Jubilee 2000, that they should do something with these numbers, that the work they had begun had to go on. With this in mind Drummond wrote to Bill Gates, to George Soros and to the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Ed Scott. Each of them eventually gave $1m to set up Data. Gates has subsequently suggested it was the best million dollars he ever spent.</p><p>When that funding came through, Drummond and Bono were already finding their way around the White House. Condoleezza Rice, in particular, was a fighter on their behalf. Drummond recalls a particular meeting with Rice at the G8 summit in Genoa in 2001, the summer before 9/11, partly because it was a surreal occasion. The summit had been moved to an aircraft carrier because of fears that suicide bombers in planes might target the conference. 'One morning Bob and Bono and I were sitting with Dr Rice having a coffee outside, and she was suggesting that she thought Drop the Debt had been very effective and successful and they wanted to build on it. Suddenly out of the water comes a man in a frog suit. We all thought: is he a terrorist? He comes right up in his flippers and stares at us. And then he says to Bono: \"Are you Bono?\" and Bono says yes. And he says to Dr Rice: \"Are you the girl off the telly?\" And she says: \"Well, kind of.\" And he flops away.' </p><p>There were several results of that 'frogman' conversation: one was the extraordinary pledge from the Bush government to work toward 100 per cent debt cancellation, another was that Drummond was seconded for several months to Washington, to help draft the parameters of what became the president's $10bn Millennium Challenge Account, which rewarded good governance in Africa with capital investment. Drummond didn't have an office in Washington at the time, so he worked out of a Kinko's copy shop. </p><p>At the same time, he and Bono and Shriver were organising a Heart of America tour, a kind of magic bus roadshow of American states - Lincoln, Nebraska to Nashville, Tennessee with Lance Armstrong, Warren Buffett, Ashley Judd, Bono and Shriver on board. 'We did town hall debates about the Aids crisis,' he says. 'As a result, in 2002 we got 10,000 Americans to contact the White House to ask for a historic Aids initiative to be included in the 2003 State of the Union address.'</p><p>Drummond is given to understatement. 'It was a challenge at the time to have to say to the president of the United States that $10bn for Africa was not enough,' he suggests. 'In addition we wanted the Aids programme. I was basically negotiating the terms of whether Bono would be in a photograph with Bush, which in the end he was, because we decided the terms of the deal were good enough.' The terms of the deal were $15bn for Aids in Africa, which has risen to $20bn. 'We are,' Drummond says, 'currently looking at a re-authorisation of $50bn, to be spent more widely on health, over the next five years.'</p><p>Despite these successes, in his recent acclaimed book The Bottom Billion, the Oxford academic Paul Collier is less than flattering about the contribution made by Bono and Geldof to the development debate. 'Development buzz is generated by rock stars, celebrities and NGOs,' he writes. 'To its credit it does focus on the plight of the bottom billion. It is thanks to development buzz that Africa gets on the agenda of the G8... Unfortunately, although the plight of the bottom billion lends itself to simple moralising, the answers do not. It is a problem that needs to be hit with several policies at the same time, some of them counterintuitive. Don't look to development buzz to develop such an agenda: it is at times a headless heart.'</p><p>The day after we have been out at Kilimanjaro we fly back to Dar es Salaam; the small plane is delayed nine hours, so we arrive at 4.30am, Drummond having slept flat out on the floor of the airport. At eight he is due at an Aids hospital to see Bono - who has interrupted a family holiday in Kenya - to make a film for an American Idol fundraiser. </p><p>Data has never been shy of mass media. The hospital at which the film is being made is a Catholic mission which gives Aids treatment to 32,000 people, with 3,000 new cases a month. Its free antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) are supplied by the Global Fund, and by George Bush's President's Emergency Fund for Aids Relief (Pepfar). </p><p>When we get there, Bono is sitting on a step of the hospital telling stories to camera with a little boy named Deloy. Deloy has lost his father and mother to Aids in the past couple of years. He has a memory box, which he is sharing with the viewers of American Idol; in it is his father's rosary. Bono tells Deloy his own mother died when he was 13, so he knows a bit about how it feels. 'Two pills a day would have saved your parents, Deloy,' he says. Deloy is a Chelsea fan; he wants, he says quietly, to be a high court judge. 'Do you believe in God?' Bono asks Deloy, 'even after all that has happened to you?' Deloy nods. 'Well, Deloy, God believes in you, too.' With that hope in mind Bono hands over to Annie Lennox in Johannesburg. Before he goes he addresses the American Idol audience directly: 'Remember: you can save a life tonight, but tomorrow you can change the world. Click on to <a href=\"http://www.one.org\">One.org</a>. Put on your marching boots, tell the politicians what you think...'</p><p>I'm standing with Drummond in the shade. When Bono is done with this performance - which though familiar and staged is also sincere and direct - he calls over to us: 'Jamie, you have your worried face on rather than your really worried face. So that means it was probably not too bad.'</p><p>As a result of events like the American Idol show - which raised $60m - <a href=\"http://www.one.org\">One.org</a>, the American wing of Data, is now the biggest pressure group in America outside the National Rifle Association. It has a database of 2.5m supporters and it has been crucial, Drummond believes, in keeping up the pressure on the White House. He has no doubt of the complexity of the issues in kickstarting the Tanzanian economy, but without 'buzz', without the simplification, in his view, nothing complicated happens. 'What Bono is amazingly good at,' he says, 'is reminding people - politicians, aid workers - the reasons they came into this in the first place. He is an antidote to jadedness and cynicism.'</p><p>When the filming has finished, the pair of them wander off to a church, where a wedding is in progress. I ask Bono about that first phone call, and he admits, laughing, he sometimes regrets having made it. 'In the Eighties I was involved with charity, but I had the sense that there was a structural aspect of this poverty I was not getting.' Jamie's explanation was like a calling. 'It has become a vocational thing now.'</p><p>He was always wary of the simplification of what Paul Collier calls 'buzz'. 'You're a rock star; it's like being a bottle blonde with a cleavage.' In meetings with finance ministers he knew he had to be the person in the room who knew the most. 'People kept saying to me: how do you know all this stuff? And the organisation that Jamie put together is how I know it. He found the people who have made this organisation a hard little fist of facts. Any politician who meets a rock star, especially an Irish one, imagines, you know, they are going to bleed everywhere. Our approach was always scientific.' </p><p>Drummond agrees. 'Washington is a very sober place: you have to know your arguments more there than perhaps anywhere. It is imperial Rome - the centre of power, for better or worse. But sometimes our policy got better too: they forced us to be a little tougher on governments and corruption.' </p><p>Celebrity does not win those arguments, knowledge does. To start with, Bono says, George Bush did not want to see them. The then treasury secretary Paul O'Neill didn't want to see them either. 'We walked in and he said: \"If you think we are going to increase aid to Africa while I am sitting in this chair you are out of your mind. We are not giving you money to redecorate some presidential palace.\" So I said: \"Well, what if we could show you that there are some countries where they are tackling corruption where there are new leaders coming through, for example Tanzania...\" And he said: \"OK, show me.\" So that began our trip through Africa - the odd couple, they called us. We would visit an Aids clinic in the morning and they would take us to a Ford motor plant in the afternoon.' </p><p>It was an education for all of them, in understanding a complexity that it is not possible to convey on American Idol 'Top-line melody: that is what I do for a living,' Bono says. 'But we have harmony and rhythm, too. Yes, there are daily maddening events, like what's happening in Zimbabwe right now, but I have just come from Kenya, where there are 46 per cent fewer malarial deaths because of increased bed-net coverage in the past three years. When people were out on the street in their Make Poverty History T-shirts, people could laugh and say: \"What will they ever change?\" We have changed a lot: $72bn of debt has now been cancelled; in Tanzania an extra 3m kids are going to schools. People say: \"Yeah, but how good are the schools?\" Well, the schools are not quite there yet and there are not enough teachers - but you know, that's the next problem to solve.' </p><p>We talk a little about what Data is. Drummond comes up with a definition. 'Basically it is a response to him [Bono] asking questions. You have heard me asking constantly this week, \"Where did that fact or figure come from?\" And it is because I know he is going to ask me when I get back. We want Data to be like that really irritating child who is always asking \"Why?\"'</p><p>They are, I suggest, growing old together, asking these questions.</p><p>'That's right,' Bono says. 'One day we are going to get a beach on the Mozambique border and build a home there for retired geriatric activists.'</p><p>There is an argument that aid will never change anything in Africa. It is put forward most persuasively by William Easterly of New York University in his book The White Man's Burden. Easterly is a fierce critic of Jeffrey Sachs, whose contention that Africa requires a 'big push' of development aid to get out of poverty has underpinned the agreement of the Millennium Development Goals and the Make Poverty History movement. Easterly contends that 'economic development in Africa will depend - as it has elsewhere and throughout the history of the modern world - on the success of private-sector entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs and African political reformers. It will not depend on the activities of patronising, bureaucratic, unaccountable and poorly informed outsiders...' </p><p>Bono and Drummond do not merit any of those adjectives. When he was in the audience at a conference in Tanzania and a speaker asked Easterly's question: 'Name one country in the world that has succeeded with aid,' Bono raised his hand. 'Ireland,' he said. 'Twenty years ago it was a very poor country and now it is a very prosperous place, all done with European aid into infrastructure.' So the speaker said: 'OK, name another country...' And Bono raised his hand again, and said: 'Germany' and started talking about the Marshall Plan. </p><p>If there is one word we hear more often than any other in Tanzania in response to Drummond's questions, it is 'infrastructure'. It comes as the answer to questions about education and questions about health and questions about agriculture. It is much harder to raise money for a sewage pipe or a motorway than it is to get emergency relief for an orphan - but those are the things that will often help bring lasting change. Ask interested parties in Tanzania what they want most and they say, 'a road from Botswana to Kenya'. The Chinese understand this: in their current quest for African raw materials and energy they barter with concrete and tarmac, and don't bother too much about transparency or accountability.</p><p>If Bono is evangelical about anything, it is about infrastructure. 'There's a part of me that would just like to give up my other life and just come here and build roads,' he says. 'Flying over Dar in a little Cessna, coming in to land I had to ask myself a question: have I really got to a point when I am physically aroused by the sight of quarries? Should roads being built give me a hard-on?'</p><p>In a sense they should. Without the ability to get to school or get goods to a market or get to hospital, everything else falls down. Getting a road built, though - without the blind-eye development deals that come from the Chinese - is no easy matter. For a start, it requires statistics. Drummond does not have faith in many things, but he does have faith in measurable facts. Without facts you can't make an argument, and without an argument you can't build a road. </p><p>You could hardly find a drier place on earth than the office of Anna Mwasha. It is at the end of a corridor that might only exist in East Africa - metal doors, wooden benches, long afternoons. Mwasha's office itself is like the inside of a filing cabinet, yet Drummond inhabits it with palpable excitement. Mwasha is head of MKUKUTA, the Tanzanian government's poverty reduction unit. She is in charge of the Tanzanian Statistical Master Plan, an audit of the country's progress - a requirement of debt relief. She talks quietly about inputs and measurable surveys and about the fact that 'women in labour can make it to prenatal care, but when it comes to birth, without roads, often they are stranded in their villages. Only 40 per cent make it to a clinic, while 90 per cent go to prenatal.' One in 30 women dies in childbirth in some of these rural areas. Drummond is captivated. 'Once a government starts to invest in independent statistics then you have a real chance,' he says. </p><p>With such fact collecting about health, and about education, Drummond knows he can start making other connections. In Dar we visit the offices of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which will spend the $700m that has come from George Bush for capital projects here, part of the account that Drummond lobbied for from the Washington branch of Kinko's. Much of the money will go on building roads. Ben Mchomvu, head of the Corporation, gets out a map of Tanzania and starts tracing his finger between towns and cities: 'The Japanese will build this section, this money will come from the World Bank and we will tarmac from here to here.' It is all about joining the dots. </p><p>Later, Drummond recalls how when they travelled to Ghana with Paul O'Neill in 2002, the road from the airport to the hospital they were visiting had a large sign next to it, saying 'Built by the Bin Laden Construction Group'. When he went back a couple of weeks ago with Geldof on President Bush's trip they were announcing the construction of the brand new George W Bush Highway from Accra to the airport. 'There's some hope in that...' </p><p>Back in London a couple of weeks later, I speak to Jeffrey Sachs about what he makes of Data's contribution to development in places like Tanzania. 'I think they have been phenomenally effective in raising public awareness,' he says, 'in raising political awareness, and in helping achieve commitment. There is a long list of particulars: getting rid of school fees, malaria controls, providing school meals, distributing bed nets, providing antiretroviral drugs for Aids. Data has played a crucial role in all of these areas, through cajoling, convincing, illustration. Bono and Jamie are extraordinary and unique individuals. I don't think we should underestimate what has been achieved, but also we should be shocked at the gap between the promises of governments and the deeds at this point.'</p><p>In the Data offices in Soho, Drummond and his team are putting together this year's annual Data Report, which will dwell on that gap, praising the G8 governments which have honoured their Gleneagles commitment - thus far, Britain and the US - and highlighting those that are falling way short of it, particularly the French, the Japanese and the Italians. The French have pledged to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP on development aid by 2012, but so far every year since 2005 they have cut their small aid budget; Sarkozy is now saying he will get there by 2010, but no one will believe that until it happens. The hardest nut to crack on these issues is traditionally Berlusconi. Drummond has not given up. He has his sights set on putting the arguments to the Vatican before the Italian G8 next year.</p><p>Because of the shortfall, 2008 has once again been declared an Emergency Year for Africa by Bill Gates and Gordon Brown, among others. Data's calendar is organised around some of the events at which they might make this sense of emergency count: the Tokyo International Conference on aid on 28 May, the G8 summit, also in Tokyo, in July, and an emergency UN session on Africa in September. In a meeting, Drummond's colleagues talk about the ways they can, in conjunction with the other NGOs, try to influence the 'sherpa meetings' of advisers in advance of the summits. With Japan in mind they are organising a viral film with Bono in Japanese; he or Bob will edit a newspaper in Tokyo; lobbying will be coordinated with Bill Gates and Jeffrey Sachs, and decisions will be made whether positive encouragement will prove more effective than public admonition. The Japanese finance minister recently suggested to Drummond that 'with flattery a pig can be made to climb a tree'. But then he would say that, wouldn't he?</p><p>Drummond is entirely pragmatic about these methods. Data is not about ideology; it is about persuading rich governments of the case for properly directed aid and investment. (Bobby Shriver, who created much of this philosophy and now runs, with Bono, Red, the corporate Aids initiative, says: 'We were never there to make a point, always to make a deal'). Sometimes it requires supping with parties many NGOs might consider the devil. 'Probably,' Drummond says. 'We specialise in trying to negotiate with those elements least favourable to our issues...'</p><p>The best recent symbol of the success of that flexibility was the presence of Bob Geldof on Air Force One. Drummond subsequently introduces me to Geldof at an investment forum for Tanzania on the Strand, where he is speaking with the trade minister. Was it weird to be on the presidential jet?</p><p>He laughs. 'No! What a vibe, you know. It just turned out it wasn't much better than Ryanair business class.'</p><p>Geldof is entirely sanguine about what Data has to do to get things done. 'We inhabit this bizarre thin space between the pieties of the NGOs and the politics of government,' he says. 'We weave in and out.' He was impressed by Bush's grasp of African issues and by his commitment. 'Bush saw the creativity, the intelligence, the wit of the people [in Tanzania]. It sounds like a Geldof speech, but when you see it they cease to be objects on television. Suddenly you see: give these people the tools - and bang! They are off. And Bush saw he had given them the tools to go to school, to get well...'</p><p>I wonder how much he thought that commitment had been down to the advocacy of Data and other NGOs. Ever contrary, he thinks it probably had more to do with the emergence of China in Africa.</p><p>'Still, the object was always: how do you use this access to a purpose? Basically Jamie, Lucy Matthew and the rest kidnapped Bono, and he in turn kidnapped me. I resist all the time, still do... The only thing I am certain of is that we are always wrong. Otherwise this thing would have been resolved. But then everyone else is wrong too.' </p><p>His strategy, Geldof suggests, is to always define himself in opposition to whichever way Data is going. 'I cannot stand this empire-building,' he says, gesturing with some affection toward Drummond. 'He goes fucking mad when I say this. I don't think it should be a massive structure. Very smart people, very deft, very fleet of foot. Those are the arguments we have on a daily basis on the board and elsewhere. But then, we can't stand still just using the diminishing juice of two Paddy pop singers...' </p><p>Talking to Geldof you get some sense of the challenges Drummond faces in trying to keep this group of people together, let alone trying to connect them with the world. When they are all in one room, Gates and Geldof and the rest, how does the dynamic work?</p><p>'Well,' Drummond says, grinning a little wearily, 'if there were not strains and tensions, it would be boring and not real. Tensions are good. All the time we are trying to figure out: what kind of organisation are we? Are we an NGO? Should we become more like a media company, trying to get information out to create a debate? There are a lot of different views. Some of it depends on whether you came from the music industry or the software business. There's geeks and post-punk activists...' </p><p>And there is him in the middle?</p><p>'There are lots of people in the middle,' Drummond says. And for all their disagreements - Lucy Matthew calls it 'this big messy family led by three people, Bob, Bono and Jamie, with incredible amounts of energy and incredibly clear visions, all of them slightly different' - they share a common enemy: the idea that the complex problems of Africa are insoluble. 'For all of us, really,' Drummond says, 'it is about connecting the granny who came out on the street for Jubilee 2000 or the person who bought a wristband and the policy outcome. If you thought the cancellation of debt had no effect, think again. Across Africa since the year 2000 there are 29m more children in schools; 2m Africans on ARVs, which has gone up nearly 750,000 in the last year; 46m insecticide-treated bed nets have been distributed across the continent to protect children, and expectant mothers in particular, from the mosquito bites that cause malaria. These are fantastic, fantastic breakthroughs. And they are,' he says, with relief, 'unarguable.'</p><p>Does he ever imagine they will make poverty history?</p><p>'No,' he says, 'there are no new ideas in development - it is about looking at what went wrong last time and trying to do it better and with more energy this time. No one has all the answers.' But, it goes without saying, that does not mean anyone should for a moment stop asking the questions.</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> To hear more from Jamie, Bob and Bono, three years on from the launch of Make Poverty History, visit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video\">guardian.co.uk/video</a></p><h2>Africa by numbers</h2><p><strong>55</strong> Countries in Africa</p><p><strong>24</strong> African nations in the bottom 24 countries of the UN Human Development index, a measure of population well-being</p><p><strong>119</strong> Rank of the highest-rated sub-Saharan African country, Gabon, in the UNHD index</p><p><strong>941m</strong> Population of Africa</p><p><strong>6,500</strong> Africans are dying every day from a preventable, treatable disease sub-Saharan Africa</p><p><strong>1.7m</strong> Sub-Saharan Africans have been infected by HIV/Aids in the last year</p><p><strong>1.6m</strong> Sub-Saharan Africans died of Aids last year</p><p><strong>33.4%</strong> of the adult population in Swaziland has HIV/Aids</p><p><strong>$39.9bn</strong> of aid was given to Africa by developed countries in 2006 </p><p><strong>18</strong> African countries have received total debt cancellation in the past five years</p><p><strong>1.1m</strong> Sub-Saharan Africans, mainly children, die from malaria annually</p><p><strong>3m</strong> insecticide-treated nets were given to Rwandan households in 2006 by the Global Fund</p><p><strong>66%</strong> Drop in malaria-related deaths the following year</p><p><strong>500,000</strong> children in Mozambique have been vaccinated against tetanus, whooping cough and diphtheria with its debt savings</p><p><strong>1000%</strong> Increase in Niger's teacher recruitment through foreign aid</p><p><strong>20m</strong> more children are now going to school in Africa due to debt cancellation</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Compiled by Tom Templeton</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/11/development.africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2008/may/11/development.africa","sectionName":"Politics"},{"webTitle":"Jason Solomon's Trailer Trash","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-10T23:08:13Z","sectionId":"film","id":"film/2008/may/11/5","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Cast-iron promise</strong></p><p>The astonishing, record-breaking success of Iron Man, which took over $150m around the world on its opening weekend, has ensured that a sequel will follow, whether the star Robert Downey Jr wants it or not. When I met him on the set of Joe Wright's The Soloist in Los Angeles last February, he'd just returned from filming some Iron Man scenes in Hawaii and was less than dismissive of his own work. 'It could be a piece of crap,' was in fact what he said. 'I just thought it would be kinda cool to do one of those big studio summer films for once.' He explained the fact that Swingers actor Jon Favreau was directing was a major attraction. 'He's a very funny man and became a good friend - he really let me goof around.' Iron Man looks like being one of the biggest hits of the year, even with the critics. And Downey Jr may find it hard to refuse returning to the shiny suit of Tony Stark. He and Favreau have been in constant conversation this past week as studio offers to lure them both back have, I hear, taken on staggering proportions. Indeed, Marvel have already committed to a sequel before securing either man. 'I need to look at the ways I can continue this guy's journey,' is all Robert has so far committed to.

The BBC has stumped up some of the money, but much of it has come from Simon Channing-Williams, Mike Leigh's regular producer, who fell in love with Africa when producing The Constant Gardener in Kenya three years ago.

Journalists have always been the subject of our concerns about press freedom, but now the public must become part of the equation. Working together, journalists and citizens can secure our fragile media freedoms in the face of global threats.</p><p>The amount of media freedom has increased since the end of the Cold War and the liberalisation of media markets around the world. Improving levels of literacy, increasing wealth and progressive political changes mean we have more information, debate and reporting of our world than ever before. New technology means that it is harder for authoritarian regimes to control the flow of media. News is exponentially faster, fuller and more accessible - from Burma to Birmingham.</p><p>At the same time professional journalists are still subject to familiar hazards such as violence, censorship and commercial pressure. Some would argue that these have taken new and sinister forms in places such as China, Russia or even the west. Superficially, freedom is expanding, but in practice, professional journalism is still constantly under threat. So how do we save it?</p><p>In my new book, <a href=\"http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9781405179232\">SuperMedia</a>, I argue that in the end only politics can protect press freedom but that there is a lot that the news media can do. The first step is to embrace networked journalism.</p><p>This is the idea that traditional journalism opens itself up to the public. It shares the production process from start to finish. It uses new technologies to include the citizen in every aspect of news-gathering, production and publication. It means using a lot of jargon like crowd-sourcing, social networking, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki\">wikis</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\">Twittering</a>. Many of these techniques build on existing journalism methods and are already out there. But it will also require a participatory revolution in the way we make the news.</p><p>Blogging is the least of it. Much more important, for example, is the use of camera phones by citizens, capturing news as it happens and sending it to news organisations around the world. This produced the images of demonstrations by monks in Tibet or police beatings in Zimbabwe that would otherwise have been out of the range of the professional photographers' lens. That is media freedom.</p><p>The new media freedom is also found on the campaigning pages on Facebook. It is the conversations about sexuality on Myspace and the mobile phone-ins to community radio in Kenya. It is the watchdog blogs like <a href=\"http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/\">Little Green Footballs</a> that spot when mainstream media gets it wrong or the YouTube presidential debate videos where new voices are heard. And it is tidal wave of audience interaction and participation on everything from BBC Radio 4's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ipm/\">iPM</a> to CNN's <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ireport/\">iReport</a>. This couldn't happen without the public, but it works best when enabled by the \"professional\" journalists.</p><p>Behind the high-tech clichés and Web 2.0 brands are some controversial ideas that will change how we measure press freedom itself.</p><p>In future we must think about media freedom as the human right to free expression, not just as the protection of a trade. And that means that journalists must accept that they can no longer be the privileged gatekeepers to information or the sole arbiters of editorial judgement.</p><p>In the UK this may mean abandoning absolute ideas around contempt and privacy as well as questioning shibboleths such as \"authority\" and \"impartiality\". Freedom is about choice and diversity as well as the right to pronounce.</p><p>But the power shift to the public in news production means that the journalist is now not alone in the struggle for press freedom. If the public are part of the process and they value what is created then they will also want a more free and open news media. It's a new compact of trust.</p><p>This may sound a tad idealistic. It is the opposite. Networked journalism is both a business model and a practical strategy to secure the future of journalism and its freedom.</p><p><strong>For more articles about World Press Freedom Day <a href=\"http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/category/world_press_freedom_day\">click here</a>.</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/03/networkedjournalism","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/may/03/networkedjournalism","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Why the good stuff will always triumph over spam","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-02T13:29:43Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2008/may/02/spam.html","fields":{"body":"<p>The web is 15 years old this week! Yay! To be precise, it was on April 30 1993 that Cern, which usually concerns itself with probing the nature of the universe by the usual means – giving electrons and positrons so much energy that they whizz round and round and collide with each other – published the <a href=\"http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Declaration/Page1.html\">documentation for building a world wide web</a>.</p><p>And this just in: spam is 30 years old this week. Damn! Since its <a href=\"http://www.templetons.com/brad/spamreact.html#msg\">first incarnation was email</a>, of course it pre-dates the web. (Though many people think \"internet == web\", as programmers would say.)</p><p>The interesting thing about the web is the decisions that Tim Berners-Lee made back then. Because the use was for science, he didn't try to copyright or patent anything about it; to do so would be contrary to the ethos of science, where everyone builds on what everyone else has done. He let it be possible to see how an HTML page is put together, explicitly so that people could copy and improve on it.</p><p>Consider how different things might have been: he (or Cern, his then employer) might have sought to patent big chunks of the method for communicating and laying out pages. He or Cern might have decided that the source of a page should be inaccessible except to those with the \"proper\" authority. In that case, each browser page would be something like an executable program that you'd download from the web. Courses in writing HTML would be fantastically expensive, and the preserve of a tiny priesthood. </p><h2>Wealth of websites</h2><p>However, that's not what happened. Sure, we have to take the concomitant problems: phishing sites that look indistinguishable from the real thing because they've copied all the HTML and CSS and pull in the images from the original. But it also means we can build the wealth of sites we have. It might not be too much to say that in a closed-page-source world, Wikipedia wouldn't be possible, or would only be possible with a great deal more effort by its creators.</p><p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-333901156'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2008/03/19/xspamd.jpg' alt='Spam' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>And spam? The coincidence of the anniversaries is fascinating, because it demonstrates that venality is everywhere. The first spam message, an invitation (to everyone who then had an email address, it looks like) to a computer company's showing off of its goods, didn't gain its creator much traction. But from tiny acorns, huge acreages of Japanese knotweed grow - at least online. Spam now consumes more than 70% of email traffic and about 90% of blog comment traffic (according to <a href=\"http://www.akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>). </p><p>That's before one mentions all the zillions of spam blogs – splogs – out there, churning away endlessly. There's a strange circularity about it: the splogs watch for real blogs, and copy bits, and pull in Google ads on the basis of what they've copied. Computers watching computers, copying bits and serving them up for other computers, and then being indexed by more computers (the search engines). </p><p>The intriguing question is why, given that spam had such a headstart, and that creating it is relatively easy, it hasn't completely overwhelmed the net? I know that there are some people for whom email spam is the bane of their lives: such as <a href=\"http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/13844\">this blogger in Kenya</a>, who is annoyed that his basic quota of 30 emails per day (\"You might be wondering which kind of business I do ... I'm neither a customer care representative nor a webmaster. The truth is, I do not know everybody who writes to me and do not need their mails\") is frequently used up with offers to reclaim a huge fortune looted by a West African dictator. But he has at least taken the chance to investigate: \"With some friends, we conducted our own investigation that took us to a West African country in 2006. I could not believe my eyes by seeing the 'yahoo boys' driving very expensive cars, going to expensive restaurants, [in] brief, living like princes. We also learnt from our sources that they sometimes kill people on their trail after realizing that they have lost money.\"</p><p>(Somehow I think there's a big company which isn't going to like that 'yahoo boys' tag. But it's what they call them in Kenya.)</p><h2>Smart people</h2><p>The answer, of course, is that spam is self-limiting. That doesn't mean that the amount is going to reduce. It's just that the multiple of the people who respond to spam and the amount of money they have is limited. Smart people like you and I don't respond to it. We get on and do more useful things. The spam falls into a void. And the people who don't respond to spam are more likely to hold onto their money and do useful things with it – perhaps building websites, funding useful sites, basically not encouraging the knotweed of venality to strangle what's there. </p><p>Which is the key point. Japanese knotweed is a big problem, but Britain isn't covered with it. Weeds grow faster than flowers, yet we're not overrun with them; even in fields left alone, weeds don't dominate. If there's a message from this week's anniversaries, it is that while venality will always be with us, it doesn't have to triumph. After all, that first spam was from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), which has since been subsumed twice (by Compaq, which was later eaten by HP). Spam didn't change DEC's destiny. </p><p>Meanwhile, Berners-Lee's work is still there. Spam is older, and humans will always be venal; but there will always be more useful stuff than spam.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/07/16/spam_rogertooth_4.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/may/02/spam.html","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2008/may/02/spam.html","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Pieces in our evolutionary puzzle","webPublicationDate":"2008-04-28T23:02:17Z","sectionId":"science","id":"science/2008/apr/29/fossils.evolution","fields":{"body":"<p>This year we are celebrating the time, 150 years ago, when Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace presented their ideas on evolution to the world.

Genetic data suggests we shared a last common ancestor with our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, between about 5m and 7m years ago, and there are now three important fossil finds in that formerly empty window of time. They all come from Africa, and comprise the skull of Sahelanthropus from Chad, and various skeletal parts assigned to Orrorin from Kenya, and Ardipithecus from Ethiopia. The latter finds include most of a skeleton, and together with the virtually complete skeleton of a later human-like creature called Australopithecus, currently being hewn from the underground rocks of Sterkfontein cave in South Africa, these finds should reveal much about how the human feature of walking on two legs evolved. </p><p>We believe that humans (larger brained, less ape-like, and assigned to our genus Homo) first evolved about 2m years ago, and their surprisingly early spread from Africa is well documented by the astonishingly rich site of Dmanisi in Georgia. Here, skulls, jaws and parts of skeletons of some primitive human fossils have been found beneath the remains of a medieval village. The small brain size and very basic stone tool kit of these early humans are surprising, since it had been assumed by many experts that significant advances in intelligence and technology would have been necessary for early humans to make the first moves out of their ancestral African homelands. Indeed the evidence is so challenging, it has even been suggested that we should rethink accepted wisdom that the genus Homo originated in Africa, a revolutionary idea to which I will return below.</p><p>These early, primitive, but widespread humans are usually assigned to the species Homo erectus, and this is generally regarded as the ancestor for all the human forms that succeeded it, including Homo heidelbergensis, Homo neanderthalensis, and our species, Homo sapiens. In my view, Homo heidelbergensis lived in Europe, western Asia and Africa, and about 400,000 years ago it began to split. North of the Mediterranean it evolved into the Neanderthals, while to the south, in Africa, it gave rise to us. The transition from heidelbergensis to the Neanderthals is wonderfully recorded in an assemblage of more than 6,000 human fossils found deep in a cave system in the Atapuerca hills of northern Spain. </p><p>The Neanderthal descendants of heidelbergensis are still the best known of all fossil human species, something that has been greatly helped by their very human habit of burying their dead in the caves in which they lived, thus preserving the skeletal evidence from the usual ravages of erosion, trampling and scavenging. Understanding our relationship to these close relatives took a huge step forward in 1997 with the first retrieval of ancient DNA fragments from a Neanderthal fossil, but anyone predicting that only 10 years later we would be close to reconstructing a complete Neanderthal genome would have been mocked for indulging in wishful thinking. However, this remarkable feat should be achieved in the next year or so, and may finally determine how closely related we and the Neanderthals are, and whether our ancestors interbred with them to any significant extent. The origin and spread of our own species from Africa is being revealed by fossil discoveries ranging from South Africa to Australia, with the earliest records from Kenya and Ethiopia now going back more than 150,000 years.</p><p>How little we know about later human evolution in regions such as south-east Asia has been highlighted by the discovery of a remarkable skeleton of a primitive human-like form on the island of Flores, Indonesia. The existence of this creature, given the name Homo floresiensis and nicknamed the \"Hobbit\", was completely unsuspected, and the fact that it apparently survived until less than 15,000 years ago means that modern humans dispersing through the region must surely have encountered these strange relatives. In this case the evidence is so challenging to conventional thinking that some experts have questioned its reality, insisting that the unusual features of the material are the products of abnormality rather than evolution. But if it does turn out to be a very primitive species, as I suspect, this may reinforce the minority view that important early stages in human evolution could have taken place outside of Africa, and that at present we know virtually nothing about them.  </p><p>Despite all the new finds and advances in study techniques, there are still many fascinating puzzles about our evolutionary origins. The exact nature of the last common ancestor we shared with chimpanzees remains uncertain, as is the date at which it lived, and the environment in which it originated. And although most experts still believe the event happened in Africa prior to 2m years ago, we do not really know when, where and why the first members of the genus Homo evolved. Equally, for Homo sapiens, what processes were involved in the African origin of our species, and how did we come to replace those other surviving species, such as the Neanderthals and the enigmatic \"Hobbit\" from Flores? I am confident that the pace of discovery will not only be maintained, but will quicken, and that the next generation of palaeoanthropologists will live in equally exciting times.</p><p>Chris Stringer is research leader in human origins at the Natural History Museum</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/apr/29/fossils.evolution","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/science/2008/apr/29/fossils.evolution","sectionName":"Science"},{"webTitle":"Vodafone rings changes on CO2 emissions","webPublicationDate":"2008-04-22T11:31:55Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2008/apr/22/vodafonegroup.telecoms","fields":{"body":"<p>Vodafone wants to halve its carbon dioxide emissions over the next 12 years by reducing its energy consumption and increasing the amount it takes from renewable sources.</p><p>The mobile phone company estimates that its wholly-owned operations across Europe and in Australia and New Zealand produced 1.23m tonnes of CO2 last year.

It is trying to attract the millions who can't yet afford a web connection on a PC but who can through entry-level phones such as a Nokia or Samsung.

Rising to the east are the Pennines, the long and mighty ridge that is the backbone of the north, and just to the south-east spreads the Yorkshire Dales national park. From the windows of Augill Castle the hills beckon gently. Less gently brood the great hills, nearly 3,000 feet high, of Cross Fell and Great Dunn Fell to the north. This is the green Eden Valley, an anglers' and walkers' paradise, dotted with Swaledale sheep and stone villages, criss-crossed by dry-stone walls. In the heart of it is Appleby-in-Westmorland, the 'place of the apple tree', dominated by the great castle built by the Normans and famous throughout the land for its June Gypsy Fair. </p><p>Augill looks like a perfectly formed, small, turreted castle but is really a beautifully restored Victorian gentleman's folly. (Aware that the only follies we regret in life are those we never committed, the English have a curious affection for them.) It was reputedly built in the 1840s by John Bagot Pearson who lived at Park House, nearby. Bagot fell out with his sibling and moved to higher ground whence he could look down on his family home from a house that was bigger and better. </p><p>This extraordinary creation was the result, a 'castle' built and decorated in the neo-Gothic style. Later in the century Doctor Abercrombie, surgeon to Queen Victoria, moved in. </p><p>By the time Simon and Wendy saw Augill in the 1990s it had lain empty for four years. 'We were still running a restaurant in London when I saw the castle in the back of Country Living. We had an offer on a house in Chiswick but the castle was the same price. Simon said, \"Don't be ridiculous,\" and put the details in the bin. I said, \"Let's just go for the weekend.\" </p><p>'We had nothing to lose. We have a deep sense that life is short, each of us having lost a parent when we were young, and we believe that you get just one chance. Turning the corner of the lane and getting our first view of the castle was awe-inspiring. We were in our late twenties, and we sat there thinking: Who do we think we are? Can we do this? We wrote a long list of all the things that would probably be wrong, so we could walk away - heating, roof, that sort of thing. But they were all fine. Cosmetically, however, it was a mess.' </p><p>They had no business plan, no plan of any kind. The turning point was provided by Simon's mother who sold her house, moved in with them and supported them. The idea was, simply, to do B&amp;B and live the good life. But in 2001 there descended upon the country, and with special cruelty upon Cumbria, the dreaded foot and mouth. Then along came 9/11 and the drying up of visits from the USA. </p><p>'Despite these events the bills got bigger and bigger and the guests got more excited, and we got excited too. We introduced house parties and weddings, and, in among it all, had two children, Oliver and Emily. Our black labrador Holly joined the family in year one and, more recently, Harry the white cat. </p><p>'We thought we had a lot of stuff when we moved here but it filled half a room! Simon and I like to mix antiques with things from secondhand sales, junk shops, even skips. We have found old suitcases and typewriters, and lovely old leather books. The man at the tip was the ultimate recycler; he used to pass things on and we'd donate money to charity. He found an entire set of leather-bound Churchill's Wars and chairs of all kinds. He even found a little mahogany box complete with 1920s Electrolux vacuum cleaner - untouched, and sent to the skip!' </p><p>So it's grand but intimate too, and guests feel quite at home in the elegant drawing room (with honesty bar) and the music room with its tumbling curtains, well-loved antiques, old rugs on polished floors and significant African touches (Wendy once lived there). </p><p>Bedrooms are historic but homely: four-posters, swagged curtains, maybe a turret wardrobe or a piano. Staff ply you with fabulous tea trays, scented hot water bottles, big pillows and massive tubs. You can banquet at weekends around a huge table in the dining room beneath a panelled ceiling of stunning blues; there are simpler suppers during the week. Breakfast is the sort that can lure an eager eater up a motorway: grilled Manx kippers, smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, poached eggs, Woodall's Cumberland sausages, porridge. Or the full works, with black pudding. </p><p>Augill slows you down and places you in some of Britain's loveliest countryside. The atmosphere is created by Simon and Wendy, who have chosen quality of experience over the modern pressure to have more, bigger, faster. They have reintroduced a wonderful kitchen garden, its raised beds encircling an ancient apple tree. They have also planted over a thousand trees, use LPG to heat the house, fuel open fires with wood from their own land, use low-energy bulbs, recycle as much as possible and feed their hens with kitchen waste. No longer do they use trademark soaps and shampoos here, but natural products, handmade locally. </p><p>'We are the types to wash out the glass pots and reuse them,' says Wendy. 'My family lived in Nigeria, then Malawi, then Kenya and we remember how nothing gets wasted. We wouldn't describe ourselves as eco-warriors but we don't like waste. We enjoy buying locally, too; Cumbria is one of the best counties for local food producers.' </p><p>Simon had gone from food science and technology to hotel management. 'Then Dad died, so I bought a round-the-world ticket, working as I went,' he says. 'I returned to a job on the Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph as a reporter, met Wendy at a ball and we had a couple of years together, in an idyllic thatched cottage. Four days after our wedding we moved to London and bought a restaurant. It was an ailing Italian bistro in the basement of a lovely house in Mayfair. We turned it round in 18 months and sold it on.' </p><p>Wendy has clear plans for their future. 'We need to spend more time with our children, and have decided to step up a gear - refit the kitchen, get in a chef to help with the weddings and parties, and step back a bit ourselves. We don't want to shut the kitchen door on guests; we'll do kids' and adults' cookery courses next year. We do children's suppers now - give them pizza dough to throw, things to make their own toppings. The families that come here often don't have time to cook together at home, and tend to eat out at weekends. </p><p>'We live a slow, privileged existence, and we believe in each other, which is essential.' </p><p>The acclaimed artist Andy Goldsworthy, who sees the magic in every small thing, once lived in Brough, the next village, and created his recent Sheepfold Project there. The fascinating sheepfolds and pinfolds he made or restored can all be visited. </p><p>It is not difficult to see why he was inspired by this sweet valley, squeezed between Cumbria and the Dales.</p><h2>B&amp;B details</h2><p><strong>Proprietors</strong> Simon and Wendy Bennett </p><p><strong>Address</strong> Augill Castle, Brough, Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria CA17 4DE<br/> <br/><strong>Contact details</strong> 01768 341937, <a href=\"mailto:enquiries@stayinacastle.com\">enquiries@stayinacastle.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stayinacastle.com\">stayinacastle.com </a><br/> <br/><strong>Typical prices</strong> 12 rooms &pound;140; singles &pound;100.

They saw corpses just outside their windows - the same windows that shattered as stray bullets flew through. \"For a 13-year-old,\" says Khan, \"it was like living through a war movie.\" She and her sisters heard the terrible stories of rape, of soldiers marching from house to house, brutalising whoever happened to be inside. \"I remember the three of us talking about what would happen if the army actually came,\" she says. \"I had figured out that there was a place up in the roof where I could hide behind a water tank, and if they found me, I could jump from there.\"</p><p>Khan had already decided to follow in the footsteps of her barrister grandfather, but what she saw in those months helped her decide how she wanted to practise law, and what she wanted to achieve. \"Of course, I was at a very impressionable age,\" she says, \"and what I saw I still remember very vividly. It shaped my approach to law as a means of protecting people's rights, rather than a means of protecting powerful interests.\"</p><p>Khan's concern for human rights has proved persistent. She has been secretary general of the human rights organisation Amnesty International for the past seven years, leading a campaign group consisting of 2.2 million worldwide members. This softly spoken, careful woman presides over a brief that takes in every country, and every manner of abuse, from stoning in Iran (\"a particularly heinous way of punishing anyone\"), to waterboarding by the US, unlawful killings in Kenya and the \"disappearing\" of political activists in Libya. And it brings her nose to nose with powerful opponents on a daily basis - from George Bush to the Pope.</p><p>Amnesty began in 1961, with an article in the Observer by British lawyer Peter Benenson calling for people to start taking action on human rights and freedom of expression, and specifically to speak for the rights of prisoners of conscience, who he defined as \"any person who is physically restrained (by imprisonment or otherwise) from expressing (in any form of words or symbols) an opinion which he honestly holds and which does not advocate or condone personal violence\". In the early 1970s, the group published their first report on torture, which showed that it was far more widespread and pernicious than once thought. As Khan says, this \"really shocked the world, because the understanding was that torture had disappeared with medieval regimes, and that, if it existed, it was only in repressive countries ... We showed that torture was actually being practised in many western countries.\"</p><p>There followed decades of successful campaigning - of the 6,000 prisoners that Amnesty campaigned for between 1972 and 1975, for instance, 3,000 were released in that period. In fact, the campaigns were so successful that when Khan took up the Amnesty post in August 2001, it seemed that arguments about the use of torture had become obsolete in the west, and beyond. A month later, when two planes flew into the World Trade Centre, all that changed. The torture debate was open for business, with prominent figures, including the leading American lawyer Alan Dershowitz, suggesting that in the case of a \"ticking bomb\" scenario, countries would have to reconsider their stance. Dershowitz suggested that a \"torture warrant\" could be issued by a judge \"based on the absolute need to obtain immediate information in order to save lives\", although these warrants \"would limit the torture to non-lethal means, such as sterile needles being inserted beneath the nails to cause excruciating pain without endangering life\". </p><p>Was Khan surprised by how quickly the arguments for repressive, even violent, measures snowballed after 9/11? She shakes her head. \"I think that they came out of fear, which politicians sometimes manipulate. There's this sense that if we reduce the human rights safeguards that we have - whether through prolonged detention, or detention without charge, or torture - that somehow we will be able to improve security ...\" She believes that the change to British law in 2006, which allowed for detention for 28 days without charge, was pushed through after political leaders created \"a sense that you have to sacrifice your liberty in order to gain greater security. </p><p>If people are given a choice that says if we have the option of 28 days detention without charge, we're going to make the world safer - well then, of course most people will say yes. Because they're not the ones who are going to suffer detention.\"</p><p>Along with tracking British human rights infractions, Amnesty collects human rights data globally, even from countries that, like Sudan, Iran and China, will not allow Amnesty delegates direct access. (\"In today's world, thanks to information technology,\" Khan says with a smile, \"physical access is not the only means of gaining information.\") </p><p>One country that has always kept Amnesty busy is Iraq, and during Saddam Hussein's regime the organisation collected a glut of information, with the 2002 report noting that methods of physical torture in the country included \"pulling out of fingernails, rape, [and] long periods of suspension by the limbs from either a rotating fan in the ceiling or from a horizontal pole\". </p><p>Some of Amnesty's information was used in the Foreign Office's dossier Saddam Hussein: Crimes and Human Rights Abuses. As soon as it was published in December 2002, Amnesty hit out against their report's findings being used for propaganda purposes, with Khan stating that the references were \"nothing but a cold and calculated manipulation of the work of human rights activists\". Supporters of military action quickly responded, including the Times columnist (and now Tory MP) Michael Gove, who described her as part of \"that unhappy section of the British left whose antipathy to western policy makes them Saddam's useful idiots\".</p><p>It was a pointed lesson in that strange contradiction - the way that human rights information can be used to erode human rights. Just how frustrating was it for the organisation? \"Well, you know,\" says Khan, \"it is always frustrating for us when the information that we provide is then misused or twisted to promote particular policies. What we want to see is governments being consistent in their application of human rights information - not using it at the moment when they want to invade a particular country, but when they are seeking to open relations with a country. When [in 1988] we published the reports about Saddam's gassing of Kurds, that's when we would have liked to have seen governments raise it with the Saddam regime.\"</p><p>After the human rights abuses that followed the attacks on the World Trade Centre, the Iraq war brought along a massive new wave of infractions. Was Khan surprised by the recent admission by CIA officials, for instance, that waterboarding - simulated drowning - had been used in the interrogation of suspects? \"No, we were not surprised,\" Khan says emphatically. \"We have interviewed people who were in Guant&aacute;namo or in Bagram, and we therefore had testimony from people to suggest that the CIA were using such methods ... What is appalling, of course, is that it should [be carried out] by United States officials, and that it should happen with official approval.\"</p><p>Amnesty's opposition to Guant&aacute;namo has been longstanding and vociferous, with Khan causing a storm in 2005 with her description of the prison as \"the gulag of our time\". Responding to this description, Bush referred to it four times in one news conference as \"absurd\" and said that he felt that Amnesty \"based some of their decisions on the word of, and the allegations by, people that were held in detention, people who hate America, people who have been trained in some instances to disassemble, that means not to tell the truth\". (He is thought to have meant \"dissemble\"). Khan is hopeful that Guant&aacute;namo will close this year, and says that \"there's a realisation now, broadly, among US policy makers that Guant&aacute;namo is a liability, and they need to find an exit strategy ... There is a way out of Guant&aacute;namo. People don't have to be locked up for ever.\"</p><p>Amnesty's choice of targets in the past few years has inevitably led to claims that the organisation is prejudiced against the US. Khan insists, however, that the group is neither anti- nor pro-American, and that it addresses human rights abuses by the US \"in the same way that we condemn what happens in Sudan or Iran or Saudi Arabia\". What has happened, she says, is that the so-called war on terror has brought \"a real backlash on human rights, setting back progress for decades. It's not only what the US has done - it's the message that has gone to others, who have used it as a licence to continue setting back human rights. So when we throw light on what the US has done, it is not that we are being anti-American, but that we are hoping that the US will use the potential it has, as a global superpower, to have a positive influence.\"</p><p>And charges of anti-Americanism have not been the only attack in recent years. Last summer, senior members of the Catholic church in Britain and Rome called for the withdrawal of support from Amnesty, after the group formulated its first policy on abortion, supporting it in certain, very limited circumstances - if a woman's life or health is in serious jeopardy, for instance, or if she becomes pregnant as a result of rape. Khan says she wasn't surprised by the Vatican's stance, and that while some people withdrew their membership, it wasn't \"in hordes, And, on the other hand, we've also had people turning to us.\"</p><p>Is it difficult to formulate positions that will be acceptable to all of Amnesty's worldwide membership? \"It is,\" she says. \"Obviously, one of our important considerations is to ensure that our members buy into the position, because they're the ones who have to campaign, to implement the position ... These kinds of controversial issues take a lot of time and discussion, but it's very important for us to bring people on board, because, as a large human rights organisation, the positions that we take can shape the positions of a lot of other people.\"</p><p>Khan had a distinctly political upbringing. She stayed in Bangladesh with her doctor father and full-time mother until 1973, when she left to study abroad. The education system in Bangladesh had crumbled after the war, so when some foreign friends who were part of the relief effort suggested that the teenager might do better elsewhere, her parents agreed. They didn't realise quite what was involved in sending her to Northern Ireland, however. </p><p>\"My parents had never been outside the Indian subcontinent,\" says Khan, \"and they had no idea what was happening in Northern Ireland. It was quite amusing when I arrived there [in Kilkeel, County Down], because the violence was of a lower level than what I had come through. There were bombs, and IRA attacks and so on, but I remember commenting that in Bangladesh there was no tradition of a bomb being planted and then someone phoning in to say that there was a bomb ... Of course, the situation in Northern Ireland was actually terrible at that time - this was 1973-1975, the height of the Troubles. I went from one war of liberation, to another war, a civil war ... I saw what war does to people, to human beings, and how it divides communities.\" When Khan says this, she means it in the most literal sense: while she was sent to a Catholic boarding school, despite being a Muslim, her sister, who also studied in Northern Ireland, stayed with a Protestant family and attended the local high school, so \"we have two very different perspectives of Northern Ireland.\" </p><p>Khan went on to study law at Manchester University and Harvard, before working for the International Commission of Jurists and the UN High Commission for Refugees, where she spent 20 years. Married, with one daughter, she now lives in London. </p><p>On the day that I meet her, Khan has just returned from an official visit to Bangladesh. There has been much talk of the possibility of war criminals from the 1971 conflict being tried in the region, and Khan thinks \"the chances are good, because there's been an international movement, an anti-impunity movement that you see happening in Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone ... So that's giving some encouragement to people in Bangladesh that they might also get justice. The terrible thing about the events there was that there was never any official acknowledgement of the killing ... There's a lot of confusion about numbers, a lot of claims, from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands, and Amnesty's proposal to the Bangladeshi government has been to ask for UN assistance to set up a commission of inquiry.\" </p><p>She describes a meeting, last November, with a Japanese woman who had been a \"comfort woman\" - forced into prostitution by the Japanese army during the second world war - and who took Khan's hand \"and said that the most important thing for her was that what she had suffered was being acknowledged now. Even decades later. This business about justice being acknowledged, or suffering being acknowledged,\" says Khan, \"is really very important\".</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/03/11/0311_kahn_140x84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/12/humanrights.internationalaidanddevelopment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/mar/12/humanrights.internationalaidanddevelopment","sectionName":"Law"},{"webTitle":"George Monbiot: Our awful rate of abortion is partly the Cardinal's responsibility","webPublicationDate":"2008-02-26T08:44:55Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2008/feb/26/health.religion","fields":{"body":"<p>Who carries the greatest responsibility for the deaths of unborn children in this country? I accuse the leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales, His Eminence Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor. I charge that he is partly to blame for our abnormally high abortion rate.</p><p>Let me begin with a point of agreement. \"Whatever our religious creed or political conviction,\" Murphy-O'Connor writes, the level of abortion in the UK \"can only be a source of distress and profound anguish for us all\". Quite so. But why has it climbed so high? Is it the rising tide of liberalism? The absence of abstinence? Strange as it may seem, the evidence suggests the opposite. </p><p>Last week the cardinal sacked the board of a hospital in north London. It had permitted a GP's surgery to move on to the site, and the doctors there, horror of horrors, were helping women with family planning. Though it is partly funded by the NHS, St John &amp; St Elizabeth's is a Catholic hospital, which forbids doctors from prescribing contraceptives or referring women for abortions. The cardinal says he wants the hospital to provide medical help that is \"truly in the interests of human persons\". </p><p>Murphy-O'Connor has denounced contraception and abortion many times. That's what he is there for: the primary purpose of most religions is to control women. But while we may disagree with his position, we seldom question either its consistency or its results. It's time we started. The most effective means of preventing the deaths of unborn children is to promote contraception. </p><p>In the history of most countries that acquire access to modern medical technology, there is a period in which rates of contraception and abortion rise simultaneously. Christian fundamentalists suggest the trends are related, and attribute them to what the Pope calls \"a secularist and relativist mentality\". In fact it's a sign of demographic transition. As societies become more prosperous and women acquire better opportunities, they seek smaller families. In the early years of transition, contraceptives are often hard to obtain and poorly understood, so women will also use abortion to limit the number of children. But, as a study published in the journal International Family Planning Perspectives shows, once the birth rate stabilises, contraceptive use continues to increase and the abortion rate falls. In this case one trend causes the other: \"Rising contraceptive use results in reduced abortion incidence.\" The rate of abortion falls once 80% of the population is using effective contraception. </p><p>A study published in the Lancet shows that between 1995 and 2003, the global rate of induced abortions fell from 35 per 1,000 women each year to 29. This period coincides with the rise of the \"globalised secular culture\" the Pope laments. When the figures are broken down, it becomes clear that, apart from the former Soviet Union, abortion is highest in conservative and religious societies. In largely secular western Europe, the average rate is 12 abortions per 1,000 women. In the more religious southern European countries, the average rate is 18. In the US, where church attendance is still higher, there are 23 abortions for every 1,000 women, the highest level in the rich world. In central and South America, where the Catholic church holds greatest sway, the rates are 25 and 33 respectively. In the very conservative societies of east Africa, it's 39. One abnormal outlier is the UK: our rate is six points higher than that of our western European neighbours. </p><p>I am not suggesting a sole causal relationship: the figures also reflect changing demographies. But it's clear that religious conviction does little to reduce abortion and plenty to increase it. The highest rates of all - 44 per 1,000 - occur in the former Soviet Union: under communism, contraceptives were almost impossible to obtain. But, thanks to better access to contraception, this is also where the decline is fastest: in 1995 the rate was twice as high. There has been a small rise in abortion in western Europe, attributed by the Guttmacher Institute in the US to \"immigration of people with low levels of contraceptive awareness\". The explanation, in other words, is consistent: more contraception means less abortion. </p><p>There is also a clear relationship between sex education and falling rates of unintended pregnancy. A report by the United Nations agency Unicef notes that in the Netherlands, which has the world's lowest abortion rate, a sharp reduction in unwanted teenage pregnancies was caused by \"the combination of a relatively inclusive society with more open attitudes towards sex and sex education, including contraception\". By contrast, in the US and UK, which have the developed world's highest teenage pregnancy rates, \"contraceptive advice and services may be formally available, but in a 'closed' atmosphere of embarrassment and secrecy\". </p><p>A paper published by the British Medical Journal assessed four programmes seeking to persuade teenagers in the UK to abstain from sex. It found that they \"were associated with an increase in the number of pregnancies among partners of young male participants\". This shouldn't be surprising. Teenagers will have sex whatever grown-ups say, and the least familiar with contraception are the most likely to become pregnant. The more effectively religious leaders and conservative papers anathemise contraception, sex education and premarital sex, the higher abortion rates will go. The cardinal helps sustain our appalling level of unwanted pregnancies. </p><p>But the suffering his church causes in the rich nations doesn't compare to the misery inflicted on the poor. Chillingly, as the Lancet paper shows, there is no relationship between the legality and the incidence of abortion. Women with no access to contraceptives will try to terminate unwanted pregnancies. A World Health Organisation report shows that almost half the world's abortions are unauthorised and unsafe. In East Africa and Latin America, where religious conservatives ensure that terminations remain illegal, they account for almost all abortions. Methods include drinking turpentine or bleach, shoving sticks or coathangers into the uterus, and pummelling the abdomen, which often causes the uterus to burst, killing the patient. The WHO estimates that between 65,000 and 70,000 women die as a result of illegal abortions every year, while 5 million suffer severe complications. These effects, the organisation says, \"are the visible consequences of restrictive legal codes\". I hope David Cameron, who wants restrictions on legal terminations in the UK, knows what the alternatives look like. </p><p>When the Pope tells bishops in Kenya - the global centre of this crisis - that they should defend traditional family values \"at all costs\" against agencies offering safe abortions, or when he travels to Brazil to denounce its contraceptive programme, he condemns women to death. When George Bush blocks aid for family planning charities that promote safe abortions, he ensures, paradoxically, that contraceptives are replaced with backstreet foeticide. These people spread misery, disease and death. And they call themselves pro-life.</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> Bring on the Apocalypse: Six Arguments for Global Justice, by George Monbiot, is available for &pound;10.99 from Guardian Books; to order visit <a href=\"http://www.guardianbooks.co.uk\">guardianbooks.co.uk</a> or call 0845 606 4232 <br/><a href=mailto:g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk\">g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/26/health.religion","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/26/health.religion","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Virgin territory","webPublicationDate":"2008-02-25T14:30:00Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2008/feb/25/virginterritory","fields":{"body":"<p>Sir Richard Branson is one of the most prominent corporate leaders to have apparently taken on board the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/feb/25/biofuels.theairlineindustry\">climate change challenge</a> as a core business issue. Carbon dioxide emissions in particular, he accepts, must be reduced in order to safeguard the atmosphere and climate. Some of his businesses are a major part of the problem; with few near-market technological alternatives on the horizon they face challenges. Virgin Atlantic is one of those. And that is why this weekend he made an experimental flight with a Boeing 747 powered <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4336692&amp;page=1\">in part with biofuel</a>.</p><p>Aircraft are especially damaging to the climate, not only because of the carbon dioxide they emit, but also because of the greater warming effect of pollution emitted at high altitude compared to the warming caused by equivalent pollution at ground level. When this is coupled with the recent and projected growth in aviation then the sector becomes a major issue in the <a href=\"http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/publications/working_papers/wp84.pdf\">climate change debate (pdf)</a>. Richard Branson knows this and that is one reason why he is putting so much effort into biofuel as a potential alternative to kerosene derived from crude oil.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/biofuels\">Biofuels</a> are made from plants. The idea is that because crops re-grow after being harvested, they reabsorb the carbon dioxide released when they are turned into fuel and burned in an engine, and thus overall emissions will be lower than fossil fuel equivalents. In reality, however, biofuels have a far larger climate change impact than was until recently widely appreciated. Many of the now fast-expanding sources of biofuel, such as Brazil and Indonesia, are gearing up exports to meet increased demand for crops including soya and palm oil for biofuels. They are in part doing this at the expense of their tropical forests. Tropical forests are of course massive carbon reservoirs, and the replacement of dense jungles with crops leads to a huge pulse of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere.</p><p>And then the raw materials of soya beans and palm oil need processing, and that requires energy. Nearly all of that at present comes from fossil sources. Energy is also required in the manufacture of the fertilisers that are used with many of the agricultural crops that are the feed source of biofuels, including sugar cane and corn. The nitrous oxide emissions that come with fertiliser use are very significant, as this gas is hundreds of times more potent as a warming agent than carbon dioxide. By the time all of these different emissions sources are taken into account, most biofuels don't look so green after all. Some are far worse than fossil-derived alternatives.</p><p>And then there are impacts on people and food. If we do go toward biofuels in a big way, and at the same time try to hang on to the forests that are still left, then land that is now growing food will be taken out of that function and into making alternatives to petrol, diesel and kerosene. The amount of land needed to make serious dent in our demand for fossil-derived transport fuel is huge. One estimate is that to meet the EU's target to source some 5.75% of surface transport fuel from biofuels in 2010 would require some 14 million hectares - which is much more than is available (bear in mind that the whole UK is some 24 million hectares). This is a vast area of land to meet only a small proportion of <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/aboutus/512398/289428/1881465/?version=1〈=_e〈=_e\">our fuel needs</a>.</p><p>If we do go down this road, and devote so much farmland to fuel production, then clearly the impact on food prices will be considerable, especially at a time when rising gas and oil prices are being seen in increased food costs. The impact will of course fall hardest on those with lower incomes, whether they be in Europe, or more seriously in developing countries with real and immediate food security challenges.</p><p>These are some of the reasons why green campaigners this weekend described the rush to biofuels as a \"distraction\", and others described Virgin's trial flight as a \"<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23274492-23349,00.html\">stunt</a>\".</p><p>The conclusion I reach is this. Yes, let's invest in technology and do all we can with that, but at the same time let's be very clear about the limitations of each technology, and reflect those limitations in parallel non-technological actions. In relation to aviation, that inevitably leads to demand management as being an essential part of the forward plan. This would mean that instead of the \"predict and provide\" policies we have now, a different approach would be adopted that explicitly sets out to cut growth in the sector. One aspect of such a policy would be that new runways and terminals would not get planning consent.</p><p>This is not a policy that is about bans on flying, as some of you will now write in your comments, but is rather a recognition that every part of the economy needs to play a role in cutting emissions accepting that technology cannot at present do all that we need.</p><p>So if Richard Branson is serious about climate change, and he appears to be more serious than many, can he please complement his investment in technology with some sensible advice to ministers about how they can help the sector to properly respond? One thing he should ask right away is that ministers shelve their insane plans to construct a third runway at Heathrow (that would on its own accommodate enough new air traffic to emit the same carbon dioxide each year as the country of Kenya) and expand Stansted airport. He should also ask Gordon Brown to properly reflect aviation emissions in the climate change bill that is going through parliament. Aviation is illogically excluded from this draft legislation and in relation to both technology and sensible public policy-making that is not a good idea.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/25/virginterritory","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/25/virginterritory","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Whistleblowing website vows to defy court gag","webPublicationDate":"2008-02-19T07:01:59Z","sectionId":"media","id":"technology/2008/feb/19/news.usa","fields":{"body":"<p>An international website that claims to blow the whistle on corporate and governmental fraud vowed yesterday to defy attempts by a US court to close it down.

Chinese oil workers have been taken hostage in Ethiopia and Nigeria, and opposition groups are now targeting Chinese firms in Sudan. Steven Spielberg's broadside against China's Sudan policy was just the latest reaction to Beijing's tangled web of African interests.</p><p>China's role as oil investor and arms supplier to Chad and Sudan came into focus this month as Sudanese-backed rebels nearly toppled President Idriss D&eacute;by's shaky regime in Ndjamena. Last August, D&eacute;by broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in favour of a more promising economic deal from Beijing and some protection from Sudan's regional meddling.</p><p>The Sudanese regime had wanted the rebels it armed and trained to take over in Chad and block the EU's imminent deployment of peacekeepers on Chad's border with Darfur. But D&eacute;by thwarted the plan with French military help and weapons from Libya. As European diplomats agonised over the prospect of their military mission being sidelined, Beijing stayed silent.</p><p>As western states tried to help negotiate a settlement on Kenya's  election battle, Beijing was silent again. Its sole official comment was an editorial in the People's Daily on 14 January, arguing that 'Western-style democracy simply isn't suited to African conditions, but rather it carries with it the roots of disaster. The election crisis in Kenya is just one typical example.'</p><p>Beijing's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jiang Yu, said he couldn't 'comment on the media's views', but reiterated that 'China always adheres to the principle of non-interference'.</p><p>Beijing's proclamations of 'non-interference' have given way to claims that it is using its influence for the good. That's difficult to sustain in Sudan, where President Omer el-Bashir's regime has just sent its militias to burn down more towns in Darfur, but continues to obstruct and delay the deployment of a joint African Union and UN peacekeeping force. Even worse, there is a prospect of Sudan's  peace deal breaking apart as Omer's regime blocks the demarcation of the north-south border through the country's oilfields and the promised referendum on the south's secession.</p><p>Yet if China's influence on Khartoum seems to make little difference on the ground, the same can equally be said about the more overt western pressure on Sudan. Russia, which also arms the Khartoum regime, doesn't even dignify its critics with a response.</p><p>European and American diplomats call their policy on Khartoum 'constructive engagement'. This means that they maintain intelligence co-operation with Sudan despite, or perhaps because of, its role as host to Osama bin Laden in the 1990s. Rolls-Royce and many other European companies have provided vital technology for Sudan's oil industry, although this doesn't come close to China's multi-billion investment.</p><p>Other Asian states, such as India and Malaysia, have big stakes in Sudanese oil, but have been better at dodging the opprobrium, as has Japan, which  imports more Sudanese oil than China.</p><p>Beyond the ethical finger-pointing is a collective sin of omission - western and Asian states alike have failed to equip and train the type of effective peacekeeping force that could protect civilians in Darfur. </p><p>Beijing claims credit for persuading Omer to accept the UN/AU peacekeepers. But Beijing knows it will face more  pressure in the run-up to the Olympics.</p><p>That's why Beijing's Special Ambassador to Africa, Liu Guijin, is reported to have told Sudan's Foreign Minister, Deng Alor, this month that 'the world is running out of patience with what is going on in Darfur' and 'not to do things that will cause the international community to impose sanctions on them'.</p><p>That's a change of tack from his comments last year when asked about China's arms shipments to Sudan.

A co-founder of the Magnum cooperative, Rodger struggled with the problem of war photography: how to make gripping compositions out of other people's suffering while avoiding glorification or exploitation. Throughout the second world war, Rodger pulled off the task in images of often remarkable empathy. He engraved the name of each battle zone in his tin hat (itself on public display here for the first time), but after experiencing Belsen, wished to abandon war photojournalism altogether. It was a wish he didn't allow himself to fully realise, and images of Palestinian refugees and the Mau Mau in Kenya are as potently moving as those of the blitz. <br /><strong>Robert Clark</strong> </p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> Imperial War Museum North, Sat 9 to Apr 27</p><p><strong>Christopher Le Brun, Walsall</strong></p><p>A timely reappraisal of paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures by a British artist who has followed his very own individual direction for some 30 years. Christopher Le Brun achieved acclaim during the 1980s when his Romantic bent fitted with an international revival of interest in expressionism. Never an artist looking to follow any trend other than his own maverick passions, he faded from mainstream view as the contemporary artworld shifted more towards installation and digital technology. Yet Le Brun remains a fascinating figure, able to ground the most airy of mythological imagery with an almost purist painterly touch. <br /><strong>RC</strong> </p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> New Art Gallery, to Apr 6</p><p><strong>Faisal Abdu'Allah, London</strong></p><p>It took Faisal Abdu'Allah three years to make The Browning Of Britannia, a compelling video installation about Ago Piero Ajano - a pretender to the throne of England. Once a 1980s playboy, now penniless and living in a council flat, Ago claims to be a direct descendant of the abdicated king Edward VIII. The film is an opportunity for this engaging character to recount his strange life and his dubious heritage, backed up with documents, photographs and conversations with his friends. Abdu'Allah raises very obvious questions about truth and fiction and our insatiable desire for a good story. <br /><strong>Jessica Lack</strong> </p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> BFI Southbank Gallery, SE1, Thu 14 to May 18</p><p><strong>Stuart Brisley, Southampton</strong></p><p>If the art world had an action hero, it would be Stuart Brisley, in a Bruce Willis, Die Hard kind of way. A little bit gnarled and grizzled, he's knocked about a bit and seen off enough canap&eacute;s at private views to know when a party's over. Obviously this is a terrible description of an artist who is still arguably the most politically incisive voice of British art today. Yet the problem with Brisley is that he is a somewhat enigmatic and iconic figure. Notorious for his 1972 performance in which he sat in a bath of vileness for several days, he is revered for artworks that are uncompromisingly raw in their approach to difficult aspects in history. Much of his art is site-specific, and his new show for this gallery in Southampton focuses on the sinking of two ships; The Titanic, which set off from the port in 1912 and the sinking of the MV Estonia Ferry in the Baltic Sea in 1994. <br /><strong>JL</strong> </p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> John Hansard Gallery, Tue 12 to Apr 5</p><p><strong>Bedwyr Williams, London</strong></p><p>According to the press release for this exhibition, Bedwyr Williams has given up being nice. Since his nomination for the Beck's Futures Award in 2006, he gained something of a reputation for being endearing. It is the combination of humour and pathos that does it. Whether he's pondering his big feet or posing as a Welsh bard, nothing changes. Anyway, that said, Williams' new show turns his ire on other artists, illustrating their stupidity and their self-awarded outsider status. From taking risks with heavy machinery, getting beaten up in the name of art and performing amateur taxidermy, he bemoans their arrogance with characteristically dry humour. I think I like this new Williams even more than the old one. <br /><strong>JL</strong> </p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> Store, N1, to Mar 8</p><p><strong>Suzanne Mooney, Bedford</strong></p><p>Suzanne Mooney's assemblages of photographic imagery can resemble the scrapbook or bedsit wall of a particularly culturally curious student. She cuts portraits and diagrams out of magazines and photographic manuals and piles up souvenir images from faraway places. It's a gathering together of reflective fragments, a setting of the scene for possible future scenarios. There's a sense of inquisitive delight as well as the slightly alienated bemusement of one who doesn't quite fit in. Here she presents three recent series: Souvenirs Of Bedford, Photographing Girls and Found Photographers. It's contemporary art as a kind of social photo-anthropology. <br /><strong>RC</strong> </p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> BCA Gallery, Sat 9 to Apr 5</p><p><strong>Double Agent, London</strong></p><p>In theatrical circles, children and animals are best avoided; in art, it is unquestionably the general public. Ever watched a Spencer Tunick photograph being made? Herding cats comes to mind. This exhibition focuses on that very predicament: artists who use other people as the artwork. A good example of this would be Phil Collins, who invited victims of reality TV to contact him as part of his Turner Prize exhibition. He is exhibiting together with six other artists including Pawel Althamer, Christoph Schlingensief and Artur Zmijewski. Tactical antics on offer are Zmijewski's orchestrated social confrontations between Jews, Christians, young socialists and Polish nationalists; a bit of spying courtesy of Dora Garc&iacute;a; and Collins' own brave, yet possibly career-crippling installation You'll Never Work In This Town Again, featuring artistic notables photographed just after the artist has slapped them. <br /><strong>JL</strong> </p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> ICA, SW1, Thu 14 to Apr 6</p><p><strong>Against Nature/By Leafy Ways, Leeds</strong></p><p>A couple of fascinating shows on the theme of artistic freaks of nature. Against Nature takes the Victorian fixation with mythical monsters as its starting point with a somewhat decorative cast of centaurs, chimeras and sphinxes. Such images tended to yearn back to a fictional, pre-industrial age. But soon the metamorphosis of nature through industrial influence became a more challenging subject, as can be seen here in Hans Arp blobs, Jacob Epstein robots and Louise Bourgeois' hints of psycho-sexual nightmare. In the accompanying exhibition by Ivor Abrahams, the homely stuff of manicured lawns and box hedges are stages set for a distinctly unnerving playground. Like all tales that lead to the very bottom of the garden path, his work is both naturally comforting and supernaturally sinister. <br /><strong>RC</strong> </p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> Henry Moore Institute, to May 4</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/09/exhibition.art3","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/09/exhibition.art3","sectionName":"Art and design"},{"webTitle":"Debate: what will the neighbours say?","webPublicationDate":"2008-02-06T14:36:15Z","sectionId":"society","id":"society/katineblog/2008/feb/06/debatewhatwilltheneighbour","fields":{"body":"<p>Today we are launching the first Katine debate. It introduces a series of discussions on topics from technology to conflict resolution that we hope will promote understanding and engagement in the area of development. The debates will be launched by contributors from both the academic and the aid communities.</p><p>They will cover the broad context of development in Africa, and raise specific questions and problems that affect Katine, like building health services, or improving access to education. We will try to use Katine as a way of assessing the impact of international negotiations, from the world trade negotiations to the Tokyo G8.</p><p>Our first debate raises one of the biggest arguments in development circles: can community-based development work? <strong>Daraus Bukenya</strong> from our partner Amref, with fifty years' experience building community capacity in Africa, argues for it. But first, <strong>Eva Ludi</strong>, research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), sets out the case against in our debate below: <strong>\"What will the neighbours say?\"</strong>.</p><p>The debate is neccessarily long but please join in underneath. It will close to comments after five days but if you have any further comments to make (or, indeed, any other suggestions or contributions to the Katine website), you can email me at <strong>Katine.Editor@guardian.co.uk</strong>.</p><h2>Eva Ludi, ODI</h2>The increasing focus on rural poverty and development especially in Africa is to be welcomed in a continent where about 70 per cent of the poor live and work in rural areas. But we need to ask whether a focus on a few communities is the right way to address such deep-rooted and widespread problems as poverty, inequality, and exclusion. Also, we need to ask how different today's area-based development projects are from past rural development narratives and experiences.<br/><br/><p>One reader of the <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/01/pose_your_questions_to_ugandan.html\">Katine website</a> raised some of the key points - can a village succeed in isolation from the rest of its surroundings, without parallel development of markets and infrastructure and without considering the wider politics and developments in Uganda and the rest of the world?</p><p>Area-based development projects have been criticised for repeating the same mistakes as the large-scale Integrated Rural Development Projects supported by the World Bank and others in the 1970s and 1980s. Among the criticisms of these were: that they were inadequately \"owned\" by government; had difficulties to reconcile the holistic approaches necessary to meet people's needs with the sectoral structure of government; handed down solutions that failed to take sufficient account of local realities; and had difficulties in achieving sustainability and in designing adequate \"phase out\" strategies.</p><p>Area-based development projects such as Katine must consider very carefully questions of integration. They need to be built on the government's underlying policy and priorities. This still allows such projects to pilot approaches that are innovative, but make it easier for success to be replicated and scaled up beyond the area.</p><p>For the Katine project to be successful, it needs to consider well-established lessons from earlier experiences:</p><p>* The rural poor are not a homogenous group and their livelihoods draw on a diversity of income sources. Careful baseline data collection is necessary to identify different social groups and their very specific needs.</p><p>* Power relations within rural communities need to be anticipated. Could, for example, powerless groups express their needs? Are activities carried out in a way that limits elite capture and further marginalisation and exclusion of already marginalised groups?</p><p>* If poor people are to benefit from agricultural growth, the wider political and institutional environment beyond the control of the project needs to be in place too. Markets need to be developed for the agricultural surpluses that the project is likely to generate. Markets are not only necessary for goods, but also for labour and capital. Access to land and other resources especially for disadvantaged groups needs to be improved. Barriers to market participation, such as poor transport infrastructure or information need to be tackled.</p><p>* The terms on which poor people participate in markets, i.e. their relative position within the value chain, determine the sustainability of their activity. Unfair protectionism and subsidies in Europe, America and Japan must be removed and international trade relations improved to give African farmers a chance to benefit from trade.</p><p>* The rural non-farm economy - a highly diversified sector itself - constitutes a growing source of income and employment for rural households.</p><p>* Rural-urban interactions are increasingly important and need to be integrated in any rural development approach.</p><p>* The ability of the poor to engage in productive activities in a sustainable manner and the prospects for development of rural areas depends heavily on the wider political and institutional environment, e.g. stability, legal framework, etc. as the political unrest in Kenya currently demonstrates.</p><p>Area-based development projects such as Katine can be extremely important in reducing poverty within their assigned geographical area, in providing disaggregated information on the diversity of rural communities and the diversity of livelihoods of poor rural people, or in experimenting with new approaches of working with local communities or district administrations to identify and implement pro-poor interventions.</p><p>They must, however, ensure from the onset that lessons learned - both positive and negative - are taken up by donors and by government agencies and feed into the larger policy process and processes of planning and prioritisation interventions for poverty reduction.</p><p>This will open opportunities for spreading the benefits to larger areas than just the one where the project is located. At the same time it must also be recognised that disproportionately funded pilot projects such as the one in Katine are not representative and can therefore not easily be rolled out everywhere without adaptation to different physical, socio-cultural, economic or administrative circumstances.</p><h2>Daraus Bukenya, Amref</h2>This question has many dimensions to it. Suppose we start with the premise that 'the neighbours' (those living outside of Katine) might ask 'Why Katine and not us?\" What Amref hopes to achieve from this project is not an isolated case of improvements in a few people's lives, but rather a model of good practice that can be scaled up and replicated across Uganda by the Government, private sector, International Development Agencies and bi-lateral partners.<br/><br/><p>To demonstrate how the project aims to have a wider impact than just Katine sub-county, we need to look at why Katine was chosen, the role Amref plays in supporting government to respond better to the communities they serve; the role we believe communities can play to participate in their own development and how with evidence generated from the project, the approach can be replicated elsewhere.</p><p>Katine sub-county in Soroti district, with a population of 25,000 people is home to some of Uganda's poorest people whose lives have been negatively affected by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/video/2008/jan/22/katine.nothianta.aduwe\">civil war</a>. Cattle rustling, widespread disease, drought, floods and deforestation have all contributed to exacerbating poverty and social exclusion.</p><p>The sub-county was selected because it has typical characteristics of underdeveloped regions in rural Africa but also the potential for improvement. There is a huge gap between extreme poverty faced by the local community and the lack of services provided by Government, which is especially marked in a rural setting such as Katine. Amref has worked in Soroti district for many years running projects in 17 sub-counties (Katine being the most recent).</p><p>And improvements to certain facilities in Katine such as Tiriri Health Centre, which reaches 130,000 people, serving 6 neighbouring sub-counties, will enhance access to healthcare beyond Katine.</p><p>Amref's project planning process in Katine is aligned to district and local annual plans, which govern the Ugandan development process. The project aims to improve community health, access to quality education, safe water, hygiene and sanitation, income generating opportunities and engagement in local governance, thereby contributing to achieving the Ugandan Strategic Plans for development, namely the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), Plan for Modernisation of Agriculture (PMA) and the Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP II).</p><p>Amref believes that in order for development to succeed, the gap between communities' basic requirements and government provision of services must close. By working with members of the community throughout the development, planning and implementation process, the project responds to community needs and priorities and is fully owned by the community.</p><p>This way, communities are able to articulate their needs and rights, and government is in a better position to listen and respond. For example Amref recently facilitated training of three health unit management committees to improve their ability to manage the provision of health services in Katine.</p><p>Participants included local councillors who sit on the district health committee, a sub committee of the District council. The District health management team submits their budgets to the District health committee which then submits it to the District council for final approval.</p><p>Creating this link will improve health financing, meaning community needs are met by local government; ensuring communities access quality health provision which is theirs by right, and creating a sustainable mechanism for this to continue long after Amref has left Katine.</p><p>As well as delivering material improvements to services in Katine (access to safe water, quality education and income generating opportunities) Amref believes in building the capacity of community members and groups as active partners in development rather than as passive beneficiaries of aid. Amref is an African organisation, 97 per cent of its staff are from Africa</p><p>Fifty years of experience of working with thousands of poor and marginalised communities has taught us that development needs well-networked and empowered communities who are strong, competent, and able to demand their rights with confidence.</p><p>Building networks between community groups and organisations allow members to play a more active and influential role in development, which with scale, can create a critical mass to bring about sustainable social change.</p><p>The government of Uganda has a duty and mandate to deliver development to all its citizens. Amref works to facilitate communities' and their organisations' understanding of their roles and responsibilities in good governance, as articulated in Uganda's decentralisation process.</p><p>Awareness raising, creating links and exposure to government structures contribute to demystifying the political process, thus supporting communities to hold their government to account. As the project in Katine develops and matures, we are looking to generate evidence of how positive change can come about so that a model of good practice develops that can be replicated elsewhere in Uganda and beyond.</p><p>And visible changes in Katine through strong community participation in local government planning will mean that the neighbours will see how they too can learn and adopt this approach. If this model of community based development can be demonstrated to government, not only will they have the experience to deliver the same changes in neighbouring counties, but the Katine experience will have the potential to impact policy. And policy change will have a multiplier effect, benefiting a far wider catchment area than the project itself.</p><p>As an African organisation, Amref is uniquely able work at grass-roots level and to influence governments; Amref believes this approach is sustainable and will have far-reaching impact on the future of Africa, ultimately improving health, education and livelihoods of the poorest communities across Africa.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/katineblog/2008/feb/06/debatewhatwilltheneighbour","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/katineblog/2008/feb/06/debatewhatwilltheneighbour","sectionName":"Society"}]}}
