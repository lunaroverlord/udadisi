Her family of seven didn’t even have a light in their tent. “My youngest son is very scared of the dark, and when he has a bad night I can’t just turn on a light to make him feel better,” she explained at the time. </p> <p>Another refugee, 65-year-old Mohammed, complained that the lack of light made it difficult to meet with friends after sunset. “Street lighting would help us come together again, give us some quality of life,” he said. </p> <p>Esaf and Mohammed’s wish for light was answered last year after <a href=\"http://www.ikeafoundation.org/the-ikea-campaign-brighter-lives-for-refugees-raises-e7-7-million-for-unhcr-in-its-first-year/\">Ikea’s Brighter Lives for Refugees campaign</a> raised $10.6m to bring solar light to refugees. For every LED light bulb the company sold between February 3 and March 29, the Ikea Foundation donated $1.30 to the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home\">United Nations High Commission for Refugees</a> (UNHCR). The organization used the funds to distribute solar-powered lanterns and install street lamps. </p> <p>Although the UNCHR hasn’t disclosed exactly how many lights its fundraising efforts have bought, it says that the initiative has impacted the lives of over 11,000 Syrian refugees at the Al Azraq camp. Because of the lights, UNCHR says, children can now study and adults can gather socially after dark. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/solar-lighting-india-cleantech-startup\">The startup providing solar lighting to India's poorest communities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last month, Ikea kicked off its <a href=\"http://www.ikeafoundation.org/programmes/brighter-lives/\">second Brighter Lives for Refugees campaign</a>. The program, which runs through March 28, hopes to bring solar lights to refugees in Ethiopia, Sudan, Bangladesh, Chad and Jordan. </p> <h2>Thousands of lights</h2> <p>Ikea is just one of several large companies helping bring light to the 50 million people living in makeshift camps around the world. “UNHCR relies on a number of renowned corporations to raise awareness and funds,” explains Nick Slijepcevic, the organization’s US spokesperson. “Beyond direct cash and in-kind contributions, companies are encouraged to mobilize employees and customers to raise funds and provide expertise and ideas.”</p> <p>One such company is PepsiCo. For the past several years, it has collaborated with the nonprofit Liter of Light to bring bottle lights and street lamps to people who have been displaced by conflict and disaster. In the Philippines, for example, the company has <a href=\"http://www.pepsico.com/Assets/Download/PEP_2013_Sustainability_Report.pdf\">installed nearly 200,000 lights</a> (pdf) in communities ravaged by Typhoon Haiyan. </p> <p>And according to Liter of Light Pakistan founder Vaqas Butt, PepsiCo funded the installation of 250 lights in public restrooms and hospital labor wards at the Jalozai refugee camp in Pakistan last year and plans to distribute another 450 lights by the end of the first quarter of 2015. </p> <p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://panasonic.net/sustainability/en/lantern/\">Panasonic’s 100,000 Solar Lanterns Project</a> aims to donate that many LED lights to people who are off-the-grid by 2018. Launched two years ago, the program has already donated more than 5,300 lights to refugee camps in Burma, Burundi, Kenya and Uganda.</p> <h2>The power of the sun</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/vital-signs/2014/sep/15/climate-change-refugees-un-storms-natural-disasters-sea-levels-environment\">Has the great climate change migration already begun?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What is it about sun-powered lights that makes them so attractive to large companies looking to make charitable contributions? Solar expert Jamie Cross says that it’s as much about branding as it is about helping those in need. “Light taps into people’s ideas about development and progress. As a symbol of enlightenment and knowledge, it’s an incredibly powerful thing to give away,” he says, adding that light is also politically neutral. “No one can be against [it].”</p> <p>It also helps that the technology has grown more reliable and affordable over the past decade. Because of the falling cost of photovoltaic cells, companies can now easily package and give away solar-powered lights, building relationships with households that might remember their benefactors down the road. “Even in a humanitarian crisis, companies aren’t blind to future possibilities,” Cross says. “After light comes all kinds of opportunities for the private sector.” </p> <p>UNHCR does not disclose which companies it purchases lights from, only saying it provides refugees with “the most up-to-date and relevant solar lighting products”. Currently, streetlights by Jordanian company <a href=\"http://www.ledsolarsystem.com/\">LED Solar</a> illuminate Al Azraq in Syria, and other camps boast lamps manufactured by Sunlite Solar and Sundaya. Still, UNCHR’s lack of transparency makes it difficult for consumers to judge how successful Ikea’s initiative has been. </p> <p>“As [our] largest private sector partner, the Ikea Foundation investment plays a vitally important role in the work of UNHCR in many countries,” Slijepcevic says. “Without strong and multi-year partnerships with a range of actors, UNHCR could not have the impact it does.”</p> <h2>Illuminating, but not transparent<br /></h2> <p>Meanwhile, some critics have raised concerns about the true impact of campaigns like Ikea’s. Although the World Bank has developed rigorous quality standards for solar lanterns, the products on its approved list aren’t foolproof. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/ikea-partnership-un-helping-child-refugees\">How Ikea's partnership with the UN is helping child refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Among other things, poor camp conditions can sometimes wear down solar lamps after just 12 months of use. And since the peculiarly shaped batteries in many lights are difficult to replace, refugees often return to using whatever illumination they were previously using – dangerous candles, toxic kerosene lamps or non-renewable, battery-powered torches – leaving the solar lamps as waste.</p> <p>“Corporate social responsibility is a good idea, but a lot of companies don’t mention what happens after they donate products,” says Harald Schützeichel, director of <a href=\"http://www.stiftung-solarenergie.org/\">Siftung Solarenergie</a>. </p> <p>His foundation brings light to those living off the grid, including refugees in Ethiopia, Kenya, and the Philippines. It also has trained technicians to fix lights if they break. </p> <p>“If you go to Africa, you will find a lot of solar systems which are not working [after] they are donated and installed,” Schützeichel says. “After taking a picture for the media, no one’s interested to think about maintenance.”</p> <p>Independent foundations and social enterprises like Schützeichel’s are helping to ensure some of the lights work for the long run. Last year, for instance, <a href=\"http://globalbrightlight.org/\">Global BrightLight Foundation</a> distributed <a href=\"http://greenlightplanet.com/\">Greenlight Planet’s</a> Sun King Solar Lanterns to 3,700 households at the Kiziba camp in Rwanda. That particular batch of lights had defective batteries, and partner Great Lakes Energy worked quickly to replace the duds. “Even great products will sometimes experience a bad manufacture,” CEO Sam Dargan says. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jul/30/refugee-shelters-new-designs-ikea-fema-military-haiti-jordan-syria-iraq\">Homes for refugees: eight new designs for conflict housing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ikea has gone above and beyond many other multinational corporations in its efforts to help refugees, and maintenance isn’t necessarily its responsibility. It’s a furniture company, not a humanitarian aid organization, and it’s ultimately up to UNHCR to use the money that it receives in a sustainable way. </p> <p>But Schützeichel still thinks that long-term sustainability is something that companies who donate funds for solar lights – and reap the public relations rewards – should be thinking about. “They should be open to discussing how we can make [the lights] more reliable,” he says. </p> <p><em>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/values-business\">values-led business hub</a> is funded by SC Johnson.

Even as private ownership of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-drone-hobbyist-20140622-story.html\">continues to grow</a>, the public has been slow to embrace them. One study found some <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/05/us-usa-drones-poll-idUSKBN0L91EE20150205\">73% of Americans wanted regulations</a> on drones, while 42% said they opposed private ownership outright.</p> <p>In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty/status-2014-domestic-drone-legislation-states\">36 states took up legislation</a> governing drones, and the deadline for the US to impose federal regulations is near – the Federal Aviation Authority Modernization and Reform Act expires in September. </p> <p>In such an atmosphere, the notion of “<a href=\"http://www.dronesforgood.ae/about\">drones for good</a>” may seem somewhat counterintuitive. It is, though, the guiding principle of an international competition launched by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai.</p> <p>The year-long contest, which organizers dubbed the “World Cup of drones”, sought entries from contestants looking to put drones to positive use. It garnered more than 800 submissions from 57 countries. </p> <p>On Friday and Saturday, in Dubai, 19 semi-finalists will present their work to judges and investors from around the world. The winner of the international competition will receive $1m.</p> <p>Here are some of the most innovative contenders:<br /></p> <h2>Park ranger drones, Spain</h2> <p>Poaching is a major issue in countries that are home to the world’s endangered species. Even in wildlife refuges and reserves, limited numbers of rangers are tasked with policing hundreds of acres, making it impossible to effectively protect the animals day and night. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dronesforgood.ae/award/finalists/ranger-drone\">Arnau Terrades has a plan</a>: deploy fleets of UAVs equipped with cameras, infrared sensors and high-quality microphones to deliver bird’s-eye views of the forest in real time.</p> <p>Such fleets would be supported by highly portable ground-support systems, requiring only a laptop, GPS, a communication system and extra batteries. Rangers would be able to launch drones via a car-powered catapult. The drones would use 3G technology to send position data back to the ground station and to communicate.</p> <p>Sensing suspicious activity, a UAV would sound an alarm to home base, allowing rangers to stream real-time video and react more quickly, potentially saving the lives of endangered animals.</p> <h2>Drones to relieve slums, Kenya</h2> <p>In Kenya, nearly one-third of the population lives in urban areas. Of that group, 60% – about 7.8 million people – live in slums, crudely constructed structures often so tightly packed that they only allow for very narrow dirt roads. This makes it exceedingly difficult to deliver clean water, install adequate lighting and build sustainable sanitation systems. It also poses incredible obstacles to firefighters.</p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://www.dronesforgood.ae/award/finalists/drones-better-service-delivery-slums\">David Kiarie’s drones come in</a>. He proposes UAVs to fly above slums and capture spatial data – a way to map the areas and allow for better development planning as well as the delivery of much-needed supplies at a fairly low cost.</p> <p>Kiarie hopes to provide government stakeholders with accurate, timely information attained by drones in order to fight poverty, save lives and improve quality of life.</p> <h2>Drones for search and rescue, Switzerland</h2> <p>In the wake of air crashes, earthquakes and other disasters, the first order of business is to search for survivors, a task that can be difficult and dangerous.</p> <p>Rescue efforts in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear power plant meltdown showed the limitations of using robots, so <a href=\"http://www.dronesforgood.ae/award/finalists/worlds-first-collision-resistant-drone-search-and-rescue\">Patrick Thevoz and his team of Swiss engineers</a> developed the world’s first drone that does not crash on impact and is safe to fly around humans. Encased in a kind of pliable honeycomb orb, the drones are able to roll across surfaces in order to gather optical and thermal data, which could allow more disaster survivors to get medical attention sooner.</p> <h2>Drones for reversing deforestation, UK</h2> <p>The planet’s forests are rapidly disappearing – and conventional reforestation is too costly and time consuming.</p> <p>“We believe industrial-scale deforestation can only be countered with industrial-scale reforestation,” one team member says in a submission video.</p> <p>After gathering terrain data to generate a 3D map of the environment, drones can plant biodegradable seed pods, suspended in nutrient-rich gel, at predetermined locations. The British team behind the drone says it has the capacity to plant a billion trees in a year.</p> <h2>Drones to detect land mines, Spain</h2> <p>Bosnia and Herzegovina has been at peace for almost 20 years, but <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/02/bosnia-mines-still-kill-20-years-later-201425131626160304.html\">120,000 buried landmines still dot the country</a>. Such mines have claimed more than 1,700 lives.</p> <p>Using drone-detecting dogs or humans to find and remove mines is extremely slow and dangerous – so<a href=\"http://www.dronesforgood.ae/award/finalists/landmines-detection\"> Marc Beltrán and his team</a> want to employ drones to seek them out.</p> <p>Mine-seeking drones would capture images of the landscape and run algorithms post-flight to calculate the chances that land mines are present.

One example is <a href=\"https://www.worldremit.com/en/kenya/m-pesa?selectService=bnk&amp;selectFrom=GB&amp;wt_ga04=14772821056_57102845656&amp;wt_gk04=Exact_14772821056_mpesa&amp;gclid=CIa6yPfQw8MCFWLLtAodUxQACg\">M-Pesa</a>, a mobile-phone based payments network serving millions of ‘unbanked’ in Kenya.</p> <h2>Why are we talking about fintech now?</h2> <p>Because it feels a bit like the late 1990s dotcom boom again, says Lu Zurawski, ACI Worldwide. Financial technology startups in the UK and Ireland <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accenture.com%2FMicrosites%2Ffsinsights%2Fcapital-markets-uk%2FDocuments%2FAccenture-Global-Boom-in-Fintech-Investment.pdf&amp;ei=oACYVPWgDJSxadDXgKgP&amp;usg=AFQjCNEI7N3DSfr5AFw41Cvm0fo1y5T82g&amp;sig2=wL5pW9nQ8reiZ_kLByri9A&amp;bvm=bv.82001339,d.d2s\">raised more than £461.3m from investors</a> between 2008 and 2013, while Q4 of 2014 was the most active quarter in fintech history.</p> <p>Eric Van der Kleij, Level39 puts this is down to the alignment of a few stars:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The financial crisis meant that a few financial services giants stopped investing in R&amp;D. This, coupled with new regulatory requirements imposed on the banks and the need to drive costs out of financial services, meant that opportunity was ripe ... The other star that aligned was that the financial crisis created a large talent pool of people that used to work in financial services. These people had ideas about how to either improve elements of banking – like the way things like Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) were done – or were keen to try to directly compete. In the UK we are also lucky to have a much improved policy environment that directly favours startups.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/jan/15/fintech-legal-banking-innovation-technology\">Fintech: how legal departments at banks are driving financial innovation</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Will fintech render traditional banking redundant?</h2> <p>Innovation in any sector creates winners and losers, and fintech will be no different, says Gerald Brady, Silicon Valley Bank. Some banks will thrive and others will find it hard to adapt.</p> <p>While fintech is undoubtedly disruptive, Van der Kleij warns against underestimating the capabilities of big banks. “They can afford to try many different innovations – either by acquiring fintech innovators, partnering with them to help give them scale to exciting products or services, or commissioning disruptive products that could cannibalise/replace their own businesses.”</p> <p>Rather than render traditional banking redundant, Gulamhuseinwala adds that the majority of fintechs are actually piggy backing existing infrastructure and complementing it.</p> <h2>What’s the connection between fintech and social good?</h2> <p>There are lots of examples, but we’ll focus on three. First, there’s tackling financial exclusion. In Bangladesh for example, where an estimated 70% of the population live in rural areas and fewer than 15% are connected to the formal banking sector, <a href=\"http://socialtech.org.uk/projects/bkash/\">bKash</a> allows Bengalis to send and receive money safely via mobile phones. (And financial exclusion <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/feb/21/social-enterprise-tackle-financial-exclusion\">isn’t limited to developing markets</a> – according to the Resolution Foundation, 4% of UK households don’t have bank accounts.)</p> <p>Second, companies like <a href=\"https://azimo.com/en/\">Azimo</a> and <a href=\"https://transferwise.com/\">Transferwise</a> are bringing a new level of price transparency to remittances (sending money overseas), which has typically been associated with high fees.</p> <p>Third, crowdfunding and microfinance platforms give entrepreneurs, small businesses and individuals access to funds where traditional banking might not. Tracey Horner, head of <a href=\"http://www.lendwithcare.org/\">Lendwithcare</a>, says that since its launch five years ago, 21,000 lenders have loaned almost £6m to around 17,000 entrepreneurs in developing countries. Dan Sutch, Nominet Trust points to <a href=\"https://www.modestneeds.org/\">Modest Needs</a>, which empowers the general public to make small ($10-15) emergency grants to low-income workers in the US. <br /></p> <p>In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.pennies.org.uk/\">Pennies</a> allows customers to round up their purchase price and donate to charity electronically at point of sale. “It’s not a breathtaking fintech IT innovation, but it’s a genius, simple bit of social innovation,” says Zurawski.</p> <h2>How do we encourage even more socially-oriented fintech?</h2> <p>Currently there isn’t enough of a link between impact capital, risk capital and grant funding, but if these three types of investment were aligned effectively it could create a pipeline of support for socially-driven tech innovators, says Sutch.</p> <h2>What can we learn from mobile banking companies in Africa?</h2> <p>For Van der Kleij, mobile banking in Africa has been a lesson in imagination and possibilities. For Alick Varma, founder of Osper, one interesting lesson has been the importance of basic convenience. He explains that prior to M-Pesa people were taking a 24 hour bus ride to give money to their families in rural Kenya. “The benefits of sending money home through a single text message were obvious. What was equally interesting was that the service was launched and is owned by a mobile operator – not a bank. The operator had access to 10,000 ‘branches’ relative to around 500 branches for the biggest bank!”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/fintech-startups-sustainable-financial-technology\">Fintech: financial technology startups to watch</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Is social media getting in on the act?</h2> <p>It is. WeChat, the mobile text and voice messaging app developed in China, has recently created a money-gifting scheme that sends gifts in a digital version of the traditional ‘cash in the red envelope’. According to Van der Kleij, WeChat is looking at utilising the scale and breadth of its social media capabilities as operating systems for new models of finance.</p> <h2>What should we pay attention to?</h2> <p>It’s worth keeping your eye on <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/en/\">bitcoin</a> and alternative digital currencies, says Sutch. He explains: “The social value is far from being understood, but the potential for alternative digital currencies to shift our relationship with finance (and trusted intermediaries) is apparent.”</p> <p>Platforms like <a href=\"https://www.ethereum.org/\">Ethereum</a>, <a href=\"https://ripple.com/\">Ripple</a>, <a href=\"http://www.blockstream.com/\">Blockstream</a>/<a href=\"https://blockchain.info/\">Blockchain</a> are also ones to look out for, says Van der Kleij, who explains that their ability to enable everything from smart contracts to banking means they’ve caught the attention of innovators big and small.</p> <p><em>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/finance\">finance</a> hub is funded by EY.

However, a group of UK entrepreneurs believes that decentralised renewable energy could provide a cheap and immediate source of power to those who need it most.</p> <p>John Hingley, founder of <a href=\"http://www.renovagen.com/\">Renovagen</a>, a small company that has developed a lightweight roller solar panel designed to be deployed in war zones and remote locations, came up with the idea while travelling in Asia. He explains:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We were staying in a shack in the middle of the jungle and there was a diesel generator running all night to power the fan and all the lighting. I just knew there were better ways to produce power, but some of these places are hard to get to and pose real difficulties in how you run and maintain the power supplies. </p> </blockquote> <p>When Hingley returned home, he began experimenting in his garage with tensile fabrics to create a bendable solar panel sheet, investing £40,000 of his own money, along with a £60,000 grant from the Technology Strategy Board (now known as <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk\">Innovate UK</a>). The result is a patented solar system called RollArray – a 9mm thick photovoltaic sheet that “rolls up like a carpet... [and] can be pulled in a trailer by a Honda Civic”, he says.</p> <p>Hingley says the system is 10 times more powerful than any other transportable solar generator of the same size, and that a 20ft container can house a system capable of producing 100 kilowatts at peak performance.</p> <p>The business has UK patents in place and has also filed US and Patent Corporation Treaty patents. With global protection pending, Hingley has begun talks with major buyers. <br /></p> <p>“There are real market opportunities for these off-the-grid locations and also for areas hit by natural disasters across the world,” he says. “You need to get power on the ground very quickly after a disaster to power things like medical facilities, communications and water desalination machines – things that are going to save people’s lives.”</p> <p>Hingley is also engaged in talks with the US military. “The military is very interested as they can power forward operating bases with this and reduce fuel convoys. During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, 3,000 US soldiers were killed in fuel convoys, so there are a huge amount of lives that could be saved.”</p> <p>Wars often lead to civilians being displaced to safer areas, such as refugee camps. Living in these communities can be highly stressful, particularly as family members can become separated and lost in camps which have populations larger than many cities. </p> <p>Daniel Becerra, co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.buffalogrid.org/\">BuffaloGrid</a>, aims to relieve some of these worries by enabling mobile phones to be charged in off-grid locations. The UK company has developed a small portable unit resembling a toolbox which users can plug their phones into to charge. The BuffaloGrid Hub can run off any power source, including solar panels. Users unlock the box via text message to enable it to charge and in return the company obtains data valuable to major telecoms providers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf8c71996b0d68b76d6f5a4d27dd4df5ec9e4fdc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422459247325/27612028-63c4-42d4-bcc1-3256e4c5f917-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"BuffaloGrid\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BuffaloGrid Hub charging mobile phones using solar panel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BuffaloGrid</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Becerra says there’s a huge demand for this because many of the world’s poorest people, while lacking a power supply, nevertheless have their own mobile phones. He says the UN is interested in his company’s services to aid disaster relief in key areas. “Our unit is something which can definitely be very useful in the situations where they are working,” he explains.</p> <p>But off-grid power is not only needed in times of war and natural disasters. The most poverty-stricken regions of the world lack access to continuous power. Varun Sharma, director of corporate development at <a href=\"http://www.bboxx.co.uk/\">Bboxx</a>, which sells off-grid solar systems, says this market gap is driving the growth of the business. Bbox’s core product is a solar home system, known as the BB17, which contains a 17 amp battery encased in a control unit. This allows people in cut-off regions to power a range of standard appliances.</p> <p>Bboxx – which works in 35 countries, including Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda – is effectively trying to create a utility company for the developing world. Like Hingley and Becerra, Sharma regards decentralised renewable power as the only way to bring electricity to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable regions. </p> <p>“We want to replace the need to extend the grid to those areas,” Sharma says. “The areas we are in don’t have the purchasing power to get a grid connection and keep it running. The likelihood of the extension of the grid ever taking place, in terms of the economics, is low.”</p> <p><em>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/technology-and-innovation\">technology and innovation hub</a> is funded by BT.

Rural youth migrate to cities in search of employment, and lack of infrastructure and education leads to poverty and malnutrition.

I wanted to be an actor,” says Vicky Ferguson, the British director of <a href=\"http://www.gladshouse.com/\">Glad’s House</a> in Mombasa, Kenya, a project for street children which grew out of a gap-year trip to Africa to broaden her horizons before drama school 10 years ago.</p> <p>A decade on, the charity she set up has hit its stride; in 2014 Glad’s House started three new programmes, including long-planned advocacy work for children and young people in the criminal justice system. But the trajectory from gap-year dream to thriving non-profit organisation has hardly been easy, and Ferguson’s experience offers valuable lessons for anyone wanting to set up their own NGO.</p> <h2>How do you know if your charity will make a positive impact? <br /></h2> <p>“If you want to set up an NGO, you need to ask yourself whether there is really a need for it,” says Ferguson, “There are hundreds of tiny organisations struggling to get by and you need to ask yourself whether you would be better off supporting them instead.”</p> <p>She says: “Glad’s House grew out of a gap in the market. I saw hundreds of youths between 16-20 on the streets all day, stoned and just trying not to get into trouble with police. There was nothing for them. I asked around if there was a charity that helped them, but no one was doing this work. Then Abdul [a colleague] said, ‘Why don’t we set up our own charity?’”</p> <p>For Nick Turner, who set up <a href=\"http://streetaction.org/\">Street Action</a> in 2007, this question had a different answer. “My wife Rachel and I travelled to Burundi about 10 years ago and worked with the street child project <a href=\"http://newgenerationburundi.org/\">New Generation</a>. We came home feeling we had glimpsed a country, and a group of people there (street children), who we couldn’t get out of our minds. We had a nagging sense of ‘what can we do?’”</p> <p>“We felt confused about how to ‘help’ and had some ‘should/could/would we move there?’ conversations. But we realised we had neither the skills nor resources or inclination to do that. We knew we were the kind of people who could commit to a small project and visit regularly. But we lived in the UK, so it made sense to raise money and awareness in the UK, and search for networks here for the Burundian charity. And that was what they needed, not well-meaning folks from London coming to volunteer inefficiently for a few years.”</p> <p>Turner set up his NGO to support street children’s projects in Africa financially and strategically, as well as campaigning on issues and policy relating to this group.</p> <h2>You have decided to go ahead but where do you start? <br /></h2> <p>All charities must follow strict legal guidelines and anyone setting up an NGO is advised to contact the relevant regulating body in that they are operating in, such as the Charities Commission in the UK. </p> <p>To get off the ground, Ferguson’s father put up £5,000 start-up capital and they used the services of an acquaintance who was a solicitor. <br /></p> <p>Nick Turner says: “We didn’t look for formal advice but we did ask for a lot of informal advice. We didn’t have any setup money, which with hindsight would have been very useful, so we researched how to do everything ourselves (charitable remit, legal entity documents, bank account, website etc). To be honest, we have always winged it a bit.”</p> <p>Nick Crowder, founder of <a href=\"http://www.onelife-int.org/\">One Life International</a>, which facilitates development work, suggests first operating under the legal umbrella of another charity, which in his case allowed his initiative to develop its own identity “without the pressure of high-start up costs”. <br /></p> <h2>Setting up an NGO is bound to be a steep learning curve; what mistakes have they made? <strong><br /></strong></h2> <p>“At<strong> </strong>first, we made a lot of mistakes through naivety. We believed what people said they would do for us,” says Ferguson, though she adds: “Equally, we have been bowled over by what people have done for us.”</p> <p>Turner says: “I sense we would have been a bigger, bolder charity if we had spent more time working out how to build capacity (making ourselves able to rely less on volunteers and pay a staff to work for the charity in the UK. We have spent a lifetime discussing who we are and where we are going. But the hard bit is working out how to raise money to cover ‘core costs’ (not least admin costs and any salaries here in the UK). </p> <p><strong>What’s the most important consideration when setting up an NGO?<br /> </strong>Long-term commitment, says Ferguson.<strong> “</strong>I didn’t really think of the long-term implications when I was 20. Now there are 27 people working for the charity so I have to keep going for the staff and their families, as well as for the children it helps directly.” </p> <p>Turner adds: “The thing that keeps us going is that the charity is a vehicle to show commitment to a group of people over a long period of time. The money we raise in the UK is important to our partner in Burundi, but it is the fact that we are committed to working with them that they say is the most important thing we provide them with.”</p> <p>You must ensure you are making this move for the right reasons, says Crowder. “When you have been moved [emotionally], you need to step back and consider whether your response is about yourself. Why are you, as a person, moved? Have you addressed your personal issues? If not, you may take them into the work, which can be destructive.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jul/29/responsible-business-retail-supply-chains\">How to ... build a socially-responsible global supply chain</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What advice would they give to others? </strong><br /></h2> <p>“Don’t<strong> </strong>go it alone,” says Ferguson. “When you are starting out, you may be afraid to approach the ‘big boys’ but collaboration is crucial.” She adds that membership of networks such as the Consortium for Street Children has been invaluable.</p> <p>Turner singles out the board of trustees – a body of elected or appointed members who oversee the activities of a company or organisation. “Whatever the structure or aims of the charity,” he says, “the most important thing we have found is to have a strong and committed board of trustees. I would advise that anyone setting up looks for a talented and committed board while trying to ensure that anyone running the charity day-to-day has autonomy from the trustees.”</p> <h2><strong>How do you avoid burnout? </strong><br /></h2> <p>“You really do ‘birth’ a charity and it hurts,” says Crowder. “You need to keep a balance in your life and continue with other interests, or it will consume you physically, emotionally and mentally.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jan/15/sustainble-development-goals-technology-participation-africa\">Technology and people power: 5 ways to shape the sustainable development goals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ferguson hit a low point in 2012-2013, when she combined working full-time in the UK as a youth worker and spending every spare minute in Kenya. The solution was for the charity to take her on full-time “Something had to give,” she says. </p> <p> Stay focused on the “why”, suggests Turner, “and don’t get bogged down in the ‘how’. The ‘why’ does not change, but the how can be frustrating, tiring and problematic.”</p> <p>“But I would love to think that in a few decades’ time, I could look back and think: ‘we tried to commit to change something that didn’t feel right.

Any bacteria that pose a danger to humans need to be eliminated from the waste during the treatment process. “When human waste composting is carried out at the household level it becomes more difficult,” she says.</p> <p>The other obstacle is overcoming end-users’ fears over, or objections to, the reuse of faecal matter. NGOs could play a key role in getting communities to discuss the taboo subject and educating them on the potential of poo power.</p> <p>“Given this natural aversion to human waste, it takes rigorous research, careful implementation and skillful social marketing to overcome the ‘yuck’ factor,” says Kramer. “That said, we found that, in Haiti, once people are able to see, smell and touch the final product they are more than eager to test it in their gardens.”</p> <p>The organisation treats 240,000 US gallons of waste every year and has sold 75,000 US gallons of compost, Kramer says. It’s been bought by nurseries, backyard gardeners and large-scale agricultural projects run by non-profits to improve reforestation and soil quality. Kramer says human waste-based compost can bring “huge <a href=\"http://www.oursoil.org/food-security-through-urban-gardens/\">economic returns for farmers growing high-value crops</a>, such as spinach and peppers”.</p> <h2>Feeding the food chain</h2> <p><a href=\"http://saner.gy/\">Sanergy</a>, an organisation that focuses on improving sanitation in urban slums in Nairobi, is working with agricultural start-up <a href=\"http://www.agriprotein.com/\">AgriProtein</a> to recycle human faeces into animal feed via insects. Since 2010, AgriProtein has been working on developing technology that sees insects fed on streams of biowaste, including slaughterhouse waste, and then processed into flakes which can be fed to pigs and sheep. According to Teun Veldkamp, a senior researcher at the <a href=\"http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Expertise-Services/Collaboration-and-partnerships/Centre-for-Animal-Nutrition.htm\">Centre for Animal Nutrition at Wageningen University</a>, insects are ideal because they can feed on any biowaste.</p> <p>The collaboration, known as <a href=\"http://www.thebiocycle.com/\">the BioCycle</a>, is still in its infancy. Tests are ongoing to to ensure that any feed produced from insects that have been fed on faecal waste is fit for human consumption further down food chain. Once the tests have been completed, the focus will be on how to turn into a sustainable business that can help locals to make money and improve community sanitation.</p> <p>The BioCycle’s programme manager, Marc Lewis, says local NGOs could help to roll out the technology into rural communities. “NGOs can provide the training around small-scale fly rearing practices,” says Lewis. “This will help farmers to better utilise waste for the benefit of animal rearing.”</p> <p>By building their capacity to provide support to smallholders, NGOs can help communities avoid the potential health problems of composting at home without any safeguards. They can also provide smallholders with market opportunities they might not otherwise have access to.</p> <h2>Creating a business model</h2> <p>Another initiative to recycle human waste is <a href=\"http://www.peepoople.com/\">Peepoople</a>. It’s built around <a href=\"http://www.peepoople.com/peepoo/start-thinking-peepoo/\">the Peepoo bag</a>, a personal, single-use, self-sanitising, fully biodegradable toilet that can be used in post-disaster situations and others where no other sanitation is available. It has a strong business model: local women can become micro-entrepreneurs by selling bags; customers receive a monetary incentive for each bag that is returned after use and the human waste collected is turned into a sanitised solution that is sold to farmers as a cheap fertiliser.</p> <p>Peepoople is also developing is a piece of machinery that will help farmers spread fertiliser – traditional methods involve spreading it by hand which is a barrier to acceptance of using human-waste compost. </p> <p>“Normally, faecal waste is just a very difficult waste, but properly used, it becomes an asset,” says founder Anders Wilhelmson. “You get rid of a problem and gain a possibility.” </p> <p><strong>Read more like this: </strong></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/sep/10/open-defecation-sanitation-un\">‘We need to talk about open defecation’</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/15/poo-power-renewable-energy-kenya-slums-biogas\">Poo power: turning human waste into clean energy in Kenya’s slums</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/24/water-sanitation-stunting-nutrition\">What do toilets have to do with nutrition?

Its health benefits are well publicised and extra virgin oil demands a premium price. Yet some producers have been found using less expensive oils to cut costs, including nut oils. This reduces the quality of the olive oil; more importantly, substituting nut oils can be life-threatening to those with allergies.</p> <p>A bright spot in all this is food testing. It not only ensures food quality and safety, but also prevents food fraud, which <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/chafea/documents/food/food-fraud-2324102014-rey_en.pdf\">costs the global food industry an estimated $30bn-$40bn (£19.7bn-£26.3bn) each year</a> (pdf), according to the Global Food Safety Initiative.</p> <p>Where transparency is concerned, understanding the location of each point in the journey food travels from trough to table is essential. One of the best ways to achieve this is through mapping. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/11/british-grown-quinoa-supermarket-business-pret-a-manger\">British-grown quinoa is coming to a supermarket near you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By linking geographic information (all the locations that, for example, the ground meat, lettuce, cheese and sesame seed bun come from) to non-spatial data (the name and lot number of the cow, and the firm processing it), it’s possible to simplify the complex web of origins and process points so food chains can be more easily understood, accessed, traced and tracked.</p> <p>In 2004, an outbreak of avian influenza in British Columbia, Canada, led to more than $500m (£330m) in damages and lost productivity. In 2007, the Canadian province of Manitoba took part in an exercise replicating the same outbreak. They found that waiting until an outbreak occurred to collect and map information on food production premises was unreliable and slow.</p> <p>As a result, the government of Manitoba implemented a mandatory identification program using a geographic information system (GIS) that required assigning a unique number to any premise in the province where livestock and poultry were grown, kept or disposed of. The government created precise knowledge about the location of livestock along with information on legal land descriptions, owners, emergency contacts and animal information.</p> <p>This data is now used to track and visualise disease spread and identify ways to contain and eradicate it.

Most farm equipment has built-in GPS that collects and logs location data automatically. This data is easily shared, managed, analysed and viewed in a GIS. GPS data becomes valuable information about how people, livestock and products move between locations and how food products are processed. When cows are sold to new owners, there is a history of where they came from. Should one farm be involved in an incident or outbreak, the impact and implications can quickly be assessed and measures taken to correct or mitigate future problems.</p> <p>GIS technology is not expensive, enabling even small farms and local suppliers to access online tools to import, view, track, share and analyse their production data, as well as multinational conglomerates of course. Farmers can more easily provide information on where every crop or animal is grown or raised for accountability. Contractors, third-party businesses, government agencies and insurance companies have evidence of every ingredient’s journey as it passes their doors. In turn, this transparency can be used to help consumers feel less anxious about the safety of their food.</p> <p><em>Simon Thompson is director of commercial business development at <a href=\"http://www.esri.com/\">Esri</a></em></p> <p><strong>Read more like this:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/16/kenya-flower-trade-eu-pressure\">EU trade agreements threaten to crush Kenya’s blooming flower trade</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/14/fall-price-milk-dairy-farmers-out-business\">Fall in price of milk ‘could force dairy farmers out of business’</a></li> <li><strong>Brought to you by the Fairtrade Foundation: </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/fairtrade-partner-zone/2014/nov/28/south-south-trade-is-creating-a-new-path-for-fairtrade-in-south-africa\">South-south trade is creating a new path for Fairtrade in South Africa</a></li> </ul> <p><em>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/supply-chain\">supply chain hub</a> is sponsored by the Fairtrade Foundation.

Some come on foot. Others with their few possessions piled on to rented trucks. Their destination is the camps at Kakuma. Set in the flat, barren plains of north-western Kenya, this is an unlikely location for refugee camps. Yet families from as far afield as Darfur in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia arrive here.<br /></p> <p>“They come to Kakuma because it is secure – life can get better for them,” says Dominic Gachanja of the Lutheran World Federation, which administers the camps. “They have grown into a small town,” he adds. The camps house 170,000 refugees, most of them fleeing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/15/south-sudan-first-anniversary-civil-war\">fighting in South Sudan</a>.<br /></p> <p>Kakuma is in Turkana county – one of the poorest and driest parts of Kenya where it is blisteringly hot. Providing water for the growing refugee population has been a struggle, until now. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/11/kenya-water-discovery-drought-relief\">discovery of vast underground sources of water</a>, announced in September 2013, has transformed the lives of these people. Since then, seven boreholes have been dug.</p> <p>“All have been yielding, or high-yielding,” says Gachanja. Some produce as much as 60 cubic metres of water an hour, and a new well providing 110 cubic metres is about to come into operation. “Before, water was scarce; now there is enough.”</p> <p>The Lutherans were provided with a satellite-based mapping technology developed by a French company, <a href=\"http://www.rtiexploration.com/\">Radar Technologies International</a> (RTI). This uses ground-penetrating radar to locate water in aquifers. Twenty-eight aid workers were trained to use the laptop, GPS system and maps that indicate where the best prospects for drilling are.</p> <p>The transformation has been remarkable. “In 2011, before we had this technology, we drilled 10 boreholes,” Gachanja says. “Six were dry, and the best well provided just 25 cubic metres of water an hour.”</p> <p>Life at Kakuma is hard. Last November the World Food Programme – running short of funds – <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/search?page=search&amp;docid=54aff3a99&amp;query=kakuma\">halved rations for the refugees</a>. Many people could only afford to eat once a day, while others had to beg. However, international donors responded to WFP appeals and the rations have now been restored to their previous levels.</p> <p>But at least there is sufficient water. It has meant families have enough for their own needs, and gardens have sprung up around their homes. Vegetables are grown for sale and refugees can keep chickens to feed their families. The town of Lodwar and the nearby village of Napuu have also benefited, according to a follow-up study conducted by RTI. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9d6b5675-5a72-4ebb-92fe-adb2cbd153fd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421243166454/a3652693-22a5-43be-a839-6a75b069f8e8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"MDG : Turkana Aquifer : pastoralists migrating to Lotikipi in search of pasture and water\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkana pastoralists migrate to the Turkana aquifer at Lotikipi in search of pasture and water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RTI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One giant aquifer, fed from the mountains in neighbouring Ethiopia, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2013/sep/11/1\">estimated to be recharged at an annual rate of 3.4 billion cubic metres</a>, nearly three times the water use of New York City. When the find was made, the government, supported by Unesco, announced that <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/strategic_groundwater_reserves_found_in_northern_kenya/#.VLUSbqb7d7l\">a nationwide groundwater mapping programme would be launched</a>, to locate similar aquifers in the country. The most arid counties would be targeted first, to relieve the acute scarcity of water that many people face.</p> <p>Since then the programme has gone strangely quiet. According to Abou Amani of Unesco, planning has been under way behind the scenes. A budget is in place, of 1.5bn Kenyan shillings (£10.9m). “We are looking for funding from the stakeholders,” says Amani.</p> <p>Chrispin Juma, the interim director of water resources in the Kenyan government, confirmed that planning was under way, but said the plans were “restricted” and referred inquiries to the ministry.</p> <p>Getting a clear indication of just why the search for water appears to have been put on hold, when so many Kenyans face scarcity, is difficult to fathom. No one doubts that the giant aquifers in Turkana exist, nor that others could be found if similar surveys are conducted.</p> <p>Professor Norbert Akech Opiyo, of the University of Nairobi, attended a <a href=\"http://www.mku.ac.ke/index.php/mku-latest-news/295-lodwar-to-host-international-water-summit\">water summit in Turkana</a> late last year. “We are all perplexed by the lack of progress,” he said. “People are still doing further studies, although the finds have been proven.”</p> <p>He thinks the reorganisation of government brought about by the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11106558\">introduction of a new Kenyan constitution</a> in 2010 has left considerable uncertainty. “Nobody is quite sure who does what.”</p> <p>Others have more conspiratorial explanations for the inertia, ranging from government budgets being misspent to the suggestion that key officials have little concern for the plight of poor people in remote, rural communities, far from the capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1d375b40-a60f-4ba4-8c70-445d834c6ff0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421243447588/80b82b10-9c77-4f1c-b23c-9b7252c8a3fe-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"MDG : Turkana Aquifer : \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local herders lead livestock to the Napuu water trough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RTI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The environmental and wildlife campaigner Dr Paula Kahumbu believes that, in time, the discoveries will transform Kenyans’ perception of their country. “We see ourselves as water-poor, but this is not the case.”</p> <p>She believes that Turkana could be a net food exporter, if the underground aquifers are properly exploited. Wildlife could also benefit. “Now there is competition between wild animals and domestic livestock. If we could generate revenue from our water we could set aside larger areas for wildlife,” she says.</p> <p>Kahumbu accepts that the new constitution has increased uncertainty, and that there is a need for a new community land act, which will define just who owns the water beneath their soil. “But this is such a huge opportunity. It shouldn’t be on the back burner – we should have seen a faster rollout.”</p> <p>• Correction: In a previous version we stated that people in Kakuma had been reduced to one meal a day after rations had been halved in November.

Funds allocated for Konza would be better spent giving commercial lenders incentives to invest in new startups, they say.</p> <p>Chris Asego, co-founder of Eneza Education, an SMS-based teaching service, says he supports the idea of Konza, noting it could spawn innovation if planned and built well. But he is acutely aware of the need to spur more investors to put money into companies like his.</p> <p>“Our company doesn’t have a single Kenyan investor,” he said, adding that they had one African investor so far but were keen to find more local funding. “You realise when you go to Nairobi that most of the technological hubs are in one location – we have <a href=\"http://www.ihub.co.ke/\">iHub</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.nailab.co.ke/\">Nailab</a>, the <a href=\"http://mlab.co.ke/\">m:lab</a>, then you drive 100 metres from that building and you get other labs close by. Most of these hubs are supported by people who are not even Kenyans.”<br /></p> <p>Kenya’s information and communication technology (ICT) sector <a href=\"http://www.humanipo.com/news/46203/ict-contribution-to-kenyas-gdp-now-at-12-1/\">contributed about 12% to gross domestic product last year</a>, showing steady growth from 2006 when it made up 9% of the economy. The Konza Technopolis Development Authority (KTDA) says that by 2020 the city will create 100,000 jobs and bring in $1bn a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Konza city\">  <iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/58618218\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>But east Africa’s booming tech sector, which is anchored in Nairobi, would benefit more from private-sector partnerships and better ICT training and education programmes, says Josiah Mugambi, executive director of iHub. “I support the idea behind [Konza city], but I’m just not sure that it’s what’s needed right now. Many [in Kenya’s tech community] are sceptical about [Konza city]. Density is important but growing those companies that would eventually fill – or better still, would be able to build – such a city I think is more critical.”</p> <p>Kenya’s national development plan, known as Vision 2030, includes <a href=\"http://www.vision2030.go.ke/index.php/pillars/project/Economic/227\">a target to transform Konza into a bustling city</a> with 200,000 people working in business outsourcing in the next 20 years, with the larger goal of becoming a world class destination for tech business, education and research. </p> <p>“Konza will serve as a hub for the east African technology industries, attracting leaders from the region and beyond. Konza is not meant to compete for Nairobi business, but will complement growth. This is similar to many countries globally where there are satellite cities to decongest the capital cities,” says Catherine Adeya-Weya, chief executive of KTDA.</p> <p></p> <p>But not all Kenyan tech entrepreneurs think Konza is a bad move. Ken Mwenda, managing director at <a href=\"http://www.emobilis.ac.ke/\">eMobilis Mobile Technology Academy</a>, says: “You need to start somewhere and [Konza] is that somewhere. There have been many other disjointed government efforts and initiatives but the scale of this project means that one would have to try hard not to notice that Kenya is seriously committed to its tech industry.”</p> <p>Kenya, which has long been seen as a leader in mobile technology, has 32.2m mobile subscribers giving it a 79.2% mobile penetration rate, according to <a href=\"http://ca.go.ke/images/downloads/STATISTICS/Q4SectorStatisticsReport2014-2013FINAL.pdf\">the most recent quarterly report</a> (pdf) from Kenya’s communications authority. Many of the country’s projects focus on developing products that reach Kenya’s poorest through SMS services available on basic mobile phones.</p> <p><a href=\"http://tpjackson.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/konza-step-too-far/\">Kenya-based journalist Tom Jackson says in a blog post</a>: “There are concerns that Kenya might be getting ahead of itself in building Konza before its ICT capabilities are up to scratch. Konza may be a brave attempt at revolutionising the sector, but many feel that it should not be the first step on the road to a booming tech sector. Local interest in investment in Konza was low.”</p> <p>But multilateral organisations such as the World Bank are keen to pump funding into developing countries’ tech sectors, with Kenya touted as a model for others to follow. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etq45ovrJEw\">said</a>: “What we’re seeing in Kenya is what we need to see in every part of the developing world. We also need to find ways of building business environments that will allow the development of small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs, and we know that jobs are really the way that we’re going to end poverty.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 15 January to clarify that while Enza Education is looking for more local investment, it does support Konza Techno City.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/28/1417190612601/9413e92d-7a08-437f-a229-4ebd60990f39-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"2014: not such a bad year after all","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T07:00:07Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2014/dec/31/2014-not-such-a-bad-year-after-all","fields":{"body":"<h2>Climate change</h2> <p>From the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and a field behind a Peruvian army base in Lima to Sixth Avenue and Japan’s second city, this year put climate change back on the map.</p> <p>A combination of more pressing economic concerns and the fallout from the disastrous Copenhagen summit in 2009 has meant that cutting the greenhouse gas emissions driving dangerous global warming has not been high on many world leaders’ agendas over the past few years.</p> <p>One leader, however, has almost singlehandedly changed that as he builds his legacy. Barack Obama tightened rules for US coal power plants in June, but much more significantly he helped forge a deal between Washington and Beijing on emissions, adding a fresh sense of momentum to international negotiations.</p> <p>The deal saw the US promise to cut emissions by 28% from 2005 levels by 2025, a rate faster than its current goal for 2020. China, which overtook the US as the world’s biggest emitter nearly a decade ago, said for the first time that it would peak its emissions, by 2030.</p> <p>“2014 was the year climate change landed back on the global political agenda,” said Michael Jacobs, a climate adviser to former British prime minister Gordon Brown. He called the announcement by Obama and Xi Jinping remarkable.</p> <p>“The subject of climate change does not easily induce optimism, but there is now a genuine possibility that a new global legal agreement could be signed in Paris in December next year.”</p> <p>More impetus came in the form of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/eu-leaders-agree-to-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-40-by-2030\">an EU pledge to cut its emissions by 40% by 2030</a>.<br /></p> <p>Despite the encouraging politics, climate change continued at an alarming rate. In September, the most recent data on the emissions being pumped out globally from power plants, factories and cars showed the world is currently on track for the worst predicted levels of warming: 3-5C above pre-industrial levels, rather than the 2C considered a “safe” threshold.</p> <p>Germany <a href=\"http://www.dw.de/germany-unlikely-to-meet-carbon-reduction-targets-for-2020/a-17802417\">looks set to miss its carbon reduction target for 2020</a>, but at least renewables appeared likely to have been the country’s main source of energy in 2014 for the first time in history. With a number of new wind parks opening in November, analysts expect renewables to account for more than the 27% target the EU has set for 2030. The Schleswig Holstein region in the country’s windy north was expected to cover its entire energy needs from renewables in 2014.</p> <p>Public approval remains high. According to a survey by the pollster Allensbach in June, support for the “energy transition” project remains stable at 70%, with only 15% of Germans opposed. <strong>Adam Vaughan and Philip Oltermann</strong></p> <h2><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"febe177ecb6710ee01ff54d55424498de0fbba29\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419955734631/dec3a038-a60f-4763-b9f7-2ebe4483b18a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"People take part in a protest in Cairo against sexual harassment.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People take part in a protest in Cairo against sexual harassment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Egypt</h2> <p>In June, just two days after being sworn in as Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, visited a rape victim in hospital. The photo-op that followed was in some ways troubling. The woman was being used as a prop in a publicity exercise, and while her own face was blurred in the images released to the press, that of her relative was not.</p> <p>Sisi’s presence was, however, a minor victory for Egyptian women’s rights campaigners. It was the first time an Egyptian president had acknowledged the problem of endemic sexual violence so publicly. Whether the government’s intentions are sincere or not, at least it wants to be seen to be addressing the issue.</p> <p>In an otherwise bleak year for human rights in Egypt, this was one of a number of moves in 2014 that brought small gains for gender equality. The government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/06/egypt-criminalises-sexual-harassment\">criminalised sexual harassment for the first time</a>, leading to the country’s first convictions on such charges. Weeks later, Cairo University became the country’s first state university to institute a policy on sexual harassment.</p> <p>The policy was only written, however, after the university’s head had claimed a female student was at fault for her own mob harassment.</p> <p>The overdue national legislation was seen as a welcome first initiative against a social ill that has typically been either ignored, or blamed on the victim. UN figures suggest that 99% of Egyptian women experience regular harassment in the street. The vague and brief amendment to the penal code was, however, still a long way short of a comprehensive law to govern all aspects of sexual violence, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/13/doubts-remain-in-egypt-despite-sisis-action-against-sexual-harassment\">campaigners wonder how often and how effectively it will be applied</a> in practice.</p> <p>Change is happening, albeit slowly. In February, Hala Shukrallah <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/02/egypt-christian-woman-leads-dostour-party\">was elected as the first female leader of an Egyptian political party</a>. “What we’re seeing here is that something truly on-the-ground is happening,” Shukrallah said of the significance of her election. “It’s a reflection of the changes in the people’s psyche.” <strong>Patrick Kingsley</strong></p> <h2><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51db8fc03d242299bbfb1b2b4e2a30c357361685\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419957310172/471e0bc1-5a0e-46ec-9dc2-6730f62b8fd6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Delegates at a summit in London listen to discussions about how to prevent female genital mutilation.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delegates at a summit in London listen to discussions about how to prevent female genital mutilation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FGM</h2> <p>Before the UN day of action against female genital mutilation in February, few people were campaigning against – or even knew about – a brutal practice that affects more than 130 million women and girls around the world. Little was known about the blood loss, infections, problems during childbirth, extreme pain and loss of sexual pleasure associated with having their genitalia cut. In 2014, however, something unusual happened. An issue that had largely ignored became front page news.</p> <p>The Guardian’s End FGM campaign was at the vanguard of the push. With the website Change.org it backed a petition by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/25/fgm-young-women-fahma-mohamed-jaha-dukureh\">Fahma Mohamed from the anti-FGM charity Integrate Bristol</a> calling on the then education secretary Michael Gove to tackle FGM in schools. After it gathered more than 230,000 signatures, Gove met campaigners and agreed to write to schools about the dangers of the practice, which is carried out in communities from 29 different countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p> <p>In May the campaign moved across the Atlantic – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/12/jaha-dukureh-washington-female-genital-mutilation\">taken up by Jaha Dukureh, a 25-year-old mother of three</a> whose petition pushed the Obama administration to promise to carry out a much-needed US prevalence study and set up a FGM working group. Empowered and impassioned by the campaign, Dukureh <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/06/guardian-campaigner-returns-the-gambia-fgm-drive\">decided to return to her home country of the Gambia</a>. In October she helped organise the first ever Youth Summit on FGM, which pushed the government to publicly state that it was “committed to end all forms of gender based violence against women and girls, including FGM”, and to promise a national action plan.</p> <p>Prosecutions have proved tricker. In the UK, the Crown Prosecution Service took no further action in 10 out of 12 cases referred to it by police. The first FGM trial, of doctor Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, and another man who cannot be named, is due to start in January at Southwark crown court. In Egypt <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/20/egypt-first-female-genital-mutilation-fgm-trial-not-guilty\">a landmark case again the first doctor charged with FGM</a> ended in his acquittal.</p> <p>Towards the end of the year, the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/30/fgm-ban-ki-moon-guardian-media-campaign-un-kenya\">launched a joint UN Population Fund–Guardian programme</a> to change how FGM is reported. Five international reporting grants to allow journalists in Kenya focus on FGM were announced, which Ban said he hoped could act as a template for other African countries. <strong>Alexandra Topping</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d2e08e12968eb1f5750495ef99b082b40456ea7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419958770143/2bc1a814-0559-4fbd-8845-0dd0de1c33aa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"France's former world women's number one, Amélie Mauresmo, coaches Andy Murray.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">France’s former world women’s number one, Amélie Mauresmo, coaches Andy Murray.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>France</h2> <p>2014 was arguably a vintage year for French sportswomen breaking into fields that were previously exclusively male.</p> <p>In June, Andy Murray surprised fans and commentators when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/08/andy-murray-amelie-mauresmo-coach\">he appointed the French tennis champion Amélie Mauresmo as his coach</a>. The double grand slam champion and former world number one is only the second woman to coach a top-10 world tennis player. </p> <p>Martina Navratilova, the winner of 41 grand slam singles and doubles titles, said of Mauresmo’s appointment: “It widens the field and widens the possibilities. The ball doesn’t know if you’re male or female. The strategy is the same.</p> <p>“If a guy like Murray doesn’t care, why should anyone else care?”</p> <p>The appointment of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/helena-costa-clermont-foot-football-first-female-manager\">the first woman as head coach of a male professional football team in France</a>, however, ended up being almost as complicated as the offside rule. Portuguese-born Hélèna Costa joined the second division club Clermont Foot 63 in May, making her - on paper at least - the first and only female manager in the highest two divisions of any professional European league.</p> <p>“As a woman, it’s made me happy,” Véronique Soulier, the president of the club’s supporters’ association, told journalists.</p> <p>Six weeks after making sporting history though, and on the eve of the start of the season, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/24/female-football-manager-helena-costa-france-quits\">Costa walked out before overseeing a single match</a>. She suggested her ground-breaking appointment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/25/helena-costa-male-colleagues-football-france\">had fallen foul of some old-fashioned sexism</a>, telling a Portuguese newspaper that her male colleagues had sidelined her and left her convinced she was just a “face” to attract publicity to the club.</p> <p> Shortly afterwards Clermont Foot 63 appointed Corinne Diacre, a former women’s football international, as manager. Diacre, a midfielder with 121 caps, was chosen from 45 applicants for Costa’s job, but it was not until September that her team won its first match.</p> <p>France already boasts the only woman trainer of a French championship rugby team after the appointment of Audrey Zitter to the second division Montpellier team, the <em>Diables Rouges</em> or Red Devils. Zitter grew up in a family of rugby players and is married to a former international. <strong>Kim Willsher</strong></p> <h2><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"361ba726f19d17979ac3db0265af63d4051c5b5f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419960214934/df77d543-830d-4236-b0a2-5bb70961cb2a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Some of the 7,000 light balloons placed along the course of the Berlin Wall and released to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its fall.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the 7,000 light balloons placed along the course of the Berlin Wall and released to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its fall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Germany</h2> <p>Germany’s 7-1 defeat of Brazil in the World Cup semi-finals may have been the most talked about moment of the competition, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/13/world-cup-victory-germany-supremacy-every-level\">their eventual triumph</a> had a more personal meaning for many supporters. The win was the first for a unified Germany, adding to West Germany’s three titles, and the moment was particularly significant in the year that the country celebrated 25 years of reunification.</p> <p>It was fitting that one of the country’s most popular sites for watching the games was the “Fan Mile” at the Brandenburg Gate, an area that had been a deserted strip of death during the division of Berlin. In July, thousands gathered in the former no-man’s-land to watch each match, and later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/jul/15/world-cup-2014-germany-victory-parade-berlin-in-pictures\">to give the victorious team a hero’s welcome</a>.</p> <p>In November, it was the scene of further celebrations as Germans <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/09/berlin-wall-fall-remembered-residents-25-anniversary\">marked the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall</a> with concerts, speeches and the release of 7,000 illuminated balloons placed along the former path of the wall.</p> <p>The country’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, who was working as a scientist in East Berlin in 1989, spoke of her own experience of crossing to the west. She told crowds “there was just this incredible feeling of happiness”.</p> <p>Despite the optimism, Germany’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/02/german-division-berlin-wall-reunification-war-anniversaries\">east-west divide has not completely disappeared</a>. Twenty-five years on, the former GDR lags behind in income and employment rates. Its GDP is two-thirds that of the rest of the country, but there are signs of improvement. The government’s annual report on the state of unification showed that the mass migration from east to west had almost stopped.</p> <p>Germany has also been praised this year for its social equality, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/germany-imposes-rent-caps-inner-city-properties\">capping rent rises in inner-city areas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/15/german-university-tuition-fees-abolished\">abolishing university tuition fees</a>.

In a speech at the Berlin Wall memorial, she told hundreds of thousands of visitors that the events of 1989 “showed us that the yearning for freedom cannot be forever suppressed”.</p> <p>“The collapse of the wall showed us that dreams can come true, that nothing has to remain as it is. It’s a message of encouragement to tear down other walls, walls of dictatorship, violence, ideologies and enmity,” she said. <strong>Catherine Edwards</strong></p> <h2><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d0c118b899d78d37bba8bb2e128c11c2e2e29b6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419960833885/37e66627-91d6-44c6-ae23-3a4b96d858c1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Plastic waste at dump on the outskirts of Mumbai.

A team of Indian scientists have discovered how to transform the rubbish that litters almost every open space in the emerging South Asian economic powerhouse into something that could power a car.</p> <p>“It’s a double advantage,” said Raghubansh Kumar Singh, a chemical engineer at the National Institute of Technology, in the eastern Indian state of Odisha. “India is short of energy, and there are plastic bags everywhere which are not biodegradable which … cause lots of problems to the environment. We can solve this problem.”</p> <p>The process involves heating the waste to between 400 and 500C over china clay, commonly found in India. The constituents of the plastics break down, producing around 700 millilitres of oil derived from every kilo which can be mixed with traditional diesel or petrol. “We have tested on engines in laboratories with no problem at all. It’s effective and very, very cheap,” Singh said.</p> <p>The Indian effort is one of a number of bids to find commercially viable ways of converting the vast quantities of plastic bags cluttering up the planet into fuel. Researchers in the US and Japan are also working to perfect technology which could produce significant amounts of fuel.</p> <p>Bags make up a sizeable portion of the giant patches of “plastic soup” in the world’s oceans. Trillions are manufactured every year and at least 80% are thrown away after use. According to the Delhi government’s website, the city, which is home to 17 million people, generates 574 tonnes of plastic waste each day.</p> <p>Singh said his work had attracted considerable commercial interest. “Many people are approaching us with possible investments,” he said. <strong>Jason Burke</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f60fa8a9501693be37e64e3e2eacd91e73af5625\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419961872267/729a4e39-8b3a-4071-bad2-51ab69d76273-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A man enjoys a day out on Mogadishu's Lido beach, which has become so popular again that lifeguards have been deployed.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man enjoys a day out on Mogadishu’s Lido beach, which has become so popular again that lifeguards have been deployed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TOBIN JONES/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Somalia</h2> <p>A blind man traces his finger over braille, smiling as he spells out the words “Mogadishu rising”. A man jogs along a gorgeous coastline, construction workers mix cement and hammer nails, cafe patrons relax over cake and coffee, and hopeful young people repeat the mantra over an upbeat soundtrack: “Mogadishu rising”.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXaJC7RB-kw\">video was released on YouTube</a> to promote <a href=\"http://tedxmogadishu.com\">the third TEDxMogadishu</a>, an event with speakers including an architect, business entrepreneur, martial arts teacher, singer-songwriter, women’s rights activist and creator of a video series known as the Mogadishu Diaries. Workshops were also held at four universities.</p> <p>Mogadishu, once the last place in the world to look for joy, provided some solace during a relentlessly grim 2014. There can be no downplaying the persistent mortal dangers – in February a UN convoy and the presidential palace suffered deadly attacks – but the city’s residents continue to show defiance, resilience and hope.</p> <p>The Somali capital is enjoying a construction boom, with demand far outstripping supply and rental prices trebling in some neighbourhoods. An apartment in the new Safari complex reportedly costs nearly £222,000. The market is being buoyed by professionals pouring back from the Somali diaspora.</p> <p>Al Jazeera recently reported that the international airport, once abandoned, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5VM2PjEez0\">is now a beehive of activity</a>” with 70 flights arriving daily and new terminals under construction. “A can-do attitude is currently gripping Somalia,” the report said. “Mogadishu’s skyline is ever changing.”</p> <p>Since the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab was chased out of the city in 2011, there have been tentative, incremental steps towards a normal urban life. Cafes and restaurants have opened, embassies have returned and beaches have become popular again. In the past couple of months Mogadishu <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/23/somalia-gets-first-cash-machine\">has introduced its first cash machine</a>, its first independent art fair and the first postal service for more than 20 years.</p> <p>One of the engines of the revival is Turkey, a leading donor and ally <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/us-somalia-ports-idUSKCN0IC1DW20141023\">whose firms are upgrading Mogadishu’s air and seaports</a>, and building schools, hospitals and mosques. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was the first leader from outside Africa to visit Mogadishu in nearly 20 years and Turkish Airlines became the first international airline to return.</p> <p>No one is pretending that Mogadishu will be on the tourist map any time soon. Al-Shabaab still controls swaths of Somalia’s countryside and settlements from which it continues a guerrilla-style campaign. But it has been losing ground and in September its leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/05/al-shabaab-leader-godane-killed-us-airstrike-somalia\">Ahmed Abdi Godane, was killed in a US air strike</a>. Its hold on the capital is long gone, and in a year of global turmoil Mogadishu could claim, just for once, to be trending in the right direction. <strong>David Smith</strong></p> <h2><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f07de594cf477a4e0b70984e0a1a5d8699a7c637\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419962829307/0958505d-5f9e-4991-88c2-69a77c107fc7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An art installation created to represent the battle to save Spain's health service from austerity cuts.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An art installation created to represent the battle to save Spain’s health service from austerity cuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gustavo Sanabria</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Spain</h2> <p>On a cold night in early December, the Madrid-based art collective luzinterruptus jammed 200 syringes in a piece of lawn next to Spain’s health ministry.</p> <p>Each syringe was filled with a white light, creating a small patch of illumination that glowed bright in the dark night. The installation represented the battle being waged by many in Spain to maintain the quality of the country’s healthcare system in the face of crippling austerity measures, the group said.</p> <p>It’s a battle that’s all too familiar to Rafael Matesanz. Tapped to lead the country’s national transplant organisation in 1989, Spain was a laggard in transplants when he came into the job. Two decades later, Matesanz and his team have helped transform Spain into a world leader. In 2014, as the country’s health service reels from cuts, Spain racked up a record-breaking year for organ donations and transplants.</p> <p>“In 2013, we carried out more than 4,200 transplants,” said Matesanz. “This year we’ll be around 4,400.” Spain’s donation rate, one of the highest in the world, has risen to more than 36 per million in the past year, he said. The EU average is 19 per million.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/31/spain-health-family-transplant\">Much has been written about the Spanish model over the years</a>, including its innovative use of highly trained hospital coordinators who approach families at the moment of deciding when to donate. Matesanz has become an in-demand speaker, as health authorities in Canada, Portugal and the UK turn to his team for advice on how to implement similar reforms, and the World Health Organisation has adopted the Spanish organisational model.</p> <p>In recent years, however, as Spanish authorities signed onto austerity measures to combat the economic crisis, the country’s transplant system has not been spared. The organisation’s training budget was reduced by 20% while, across the board, the country’s annual national health budget took a €7bn (£5.5bn) cut in 2012. “The reality is that we have fewer doctors, fewer nurses and less money than we had four or five years ago,” said Matesanz.</p> <p>Countering the cuts is the fact that the country’s transplant system has become a source of pride, he said. “So everyone who works in the system gives it their best. We’re now doing more with less, which is ideal for a crisis like this one.”</p> <p>Twenty-two years after they first began to set the standard for transplants, Matesanz and his team continue to eye improvements. “We want to get to 5,000 donations,” he said, pointing to their recently completed five-year plan as a roadmap. “These are realistic goals. We’re not dreaming.” <strong>Ashifa Kassam</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419954611770/48c36c3b-e5fe-4a89-abf8-1d053676860a-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/31/2014-not-such-a-bad-year-after-all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/dec/31/2014-not-such-a-bad-year-after-all","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Poetry in motion: mobile site brings new audience to African writers","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-29T20:30:04Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2014/dec/29/africa-poetry-badilisha-mobile-phone-site","fields":{"body":"<p>“These days, the language of death<br />is a dialect of betrayals; the bodies<br /> broken, placid as saints, hobble <br />along the tiled corridors, from room <br />to room. Below the dormitories<br /> is a white squat bungalow, a chapel <br />from which the handclaps and choruses <br />rise and reach us like the scent <br />of a more innocent time.”</p> <p>These are the opening lines of Hope’s Hospice, written by Ghanaian-born Jamaican poet Kwame Dawes. He is among nearly 400 African poets from 24 countries in 14 languages who can now be heard reading their work via mobile phones – a first for Africa and the world.</p> <p>The mobile site, accessible on smart and feature phones, has been launched by the <a href=\"http://badilishapoetry.com\">Badilisha Poetry X-Change</a>, the biggest archive of audio recordings by African poets in the world. It is a significant step on this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/internet-use-mobile-phones-africa-predicted-increase-20-fol\">“mobile first” continent where</a>, with limited landline infrastructure, most people access the internet through their phones rather than on computers.</p> <p>Linda Kaoma, project manager of Badilisha, based in Cape Town, South Africa, said: “We realised we weren’t achieving our goal of reaching a whole audience in Africa. We’ve created a mobile site that can be accessed on almost any phone you have. The response has been great.”</p> <p>Badilisha appears to suggest Africa’s ancient tradition of oral poetry sits more comfortably in the 21st-century technology of the podcast than in mainstream publishing. Kaoma said: “A lot of publishers are not publishing poetry, but it does not have to be confined to books. It’s alive. The voice adds texture, adds a different layer to the poems. A lot of people are enjoying listening to poetry rather than reading it. We need to change the way we present ourselves to audiences, and audiences need to be aware of different ways of receiving poetry.”</p> <p>Badilisha began life in 2008 as an annual poetry festival in Cape Town featuring poets from all over Africa and the diaspora. The website came four years later from a desire to reach listeners and readers across the continent, and preserve the work for posterity.</p> <p>Kaoma said: “If you look at Europe it’s very easy to find archives of many things but in Africa, because of a lot of history and culture was passed down by the oral tradition, and there was lack of documentation, that’s not possible. We didn’t want history to repeat itself.”</p> <p>The site, which has about 3,000 visitors a month, was relaunched last October with new features such as guests’ top 10 poets and mobile access. It represents a much-needed boost on a continent where performance poets can be found in large cities but few have hopes of publishing a collection in print.</p> <p>Kaoma said: “The poets love it. It’s a great place to come and reflect and see what other poets are doing. I think there is value in being influenced by someone in the same context: you don’t have to change yourself to be recognised. You can be African and write about whatever you want to write about.”</p> <p>The 29-year-old said her education was dominated by Shakespeare and she only started encountering African poets when she became involved in Badilisha. She now gives poetry readings internationally. “It’s great to travel to Ghana and Kenya and find a poet writing about what I want to write about. We’re not as one dimensional as people paint us to be. We’re very diverse.”</p> <p>Badilisha’s poets include 169 from South Africa, 33 from Kenya, 27 from Nigeria, 26 from Zimbabwe, three from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one from Somalia. Among the 16 African poets in the UK is Lemn Sissay, of Ethiopian descent, who was commissioned to write for the 2012 London Olympics. He can be heard reading his work <a href=\"http://badilishapoetry.com/lemn-sissay\">The Queen’s Speech</a>.</p> <p>Each poet has a page with photograph, biography and poems in text and audio.</p> <p>Only a handful of dead poets have been archived so far but there are plans to expand this in coming months, using either a relative of the poet or an actor to perform the readings. Badilisha has two full-time staff and is funded mainly by the Spier Wine Farm in Stellenbosch, near Cape Town, along with some government support.</p> <p>Among the writers featured is Mbali Kgosidintsi, 31, from Botswana, who can be heard reading <a href=\"http://badilishapoetry.com/mbali-kgosidintsi\">I Stand Between My Africa and Me</a>. She said: “They really are pioneers. They are publishing poetry online and creating an African network. It’s a high standard of poets and the fact I can refer someone to Badilisha, and say I’m published on the site, is great.”</p> <p>The site has triggered debate about the health of poetry in Africa. Kgosidintsi, who has taken part in an African poetry festival in Beijing, China, said: “People definitely want to perform poetry but I worry that the fact that we don’t publish it, and when we do publish, we don’t sell.”</p> <p>Another poet on the site, South African <a href=\"http://www.enca.com/media/video/maggs-media-barbour-badilisha-poetry\">Natalia Molebatsi</a>, told the eNews Channel Africa: “We can’t say it’s mainstream and we’re not really trying to make it mainstream. All we’re doing is trying to share our work. Remember, it is one of the most ancient art forms. This initiative has given me an opportunity to express myself and share my work with other people.”</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/29/1419884284951/Mbali-Kgosidintsi-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/29/africa-poetry-badilisha-mobile-phone-site","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/29/africa-poetry-badilisha-mobile-phone-site","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Internet.org app gets east Africans online for free | Mark Anderson","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-27T09:00:03Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2014/dec/27/internet-org-app-east-africa-online","fields":{"body":"<p>A mobile application created by some of the world’s leading technology companies is giving Africans free access to websites with medical advice, educational tools, job vacancies and local news.</p> <p><a href=\"http://internet.org/\">Internet.org</a>, a non-profit service funded by firms including Facebook, Nokia and Samsung, rolled out in Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia this year, allowing mobile users to access a selection of commercial and community-based websites.</p> <p>Increasing the number of people in developing countries who have internet access could generate $2.2tn in additional gross domestic product (GDP), a 72% increase in the GDP growth rate, and more than 140m jobs, according to <a href=\"https://fbcdn-dragon-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t39.2365/851546_1398036020459876_1878998841_n.pdf\">a report commissioned by Internet.org</a> (pdf).

His frustration cuts through the static.<br /></p> <p>Mwale might have expected better. He won <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2013/02/23/30-under-30-africas-best-young-entrepreneurs/2/\">a degree of fame</a> in his teens for setting up a rainwater filtration and bottling company – Skydrop Enterprises – which he sold to an Israeli firm to fund the development of the website <a href=\"http://www.thenewafrica.info/marvelous-mister-mwale/\">gigavia</a>.

Elumelu said entrepreneurship was “the cornerstone to African development” – a resounding endorsement of the homegrown private sector, and an implicit rebuke of traditional aid structures that have struggled to cope with crises in Africa and elsewhere in 2014.</p> <p>The entrepreneurship programme will help to grow 10,000 startups and young businesses from across Africa over the next 10 years, targeting the creation of 1m jobs and $10bn in annual revenues.</p> <p>“This programme brings together my own entrepreneurial experience and my fundamental belief that entrepreneurs – women and men across Africa – will lead Africa’s development and transform our future,” said Elumelu.</p> <p>The fund was announced at the end of a particularly bleak year for Africa’s international image. After the optimism of “Africa rising”, which posited that consumer-driven growth bolstered by an expanding middle class would herald a new era, news was dominated by war and the spread of Ebola. In the top headline-grabbers – Central African Republic, South Sudan, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone – thousands of lives were lost and years of development undone.</p> <p>But the reality of extreme poverty and need co-exists alongside initiative and innovation in the Africa’s 54 countries, as it does elsewhere in the world.</p> <p>On 19 November, as the World Health Organisation <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/19/ebola-sierra-leone_n_6186566.html\">told</a> reporters in Geneva that the Ebola death toll had risen to 5,420, young entrepreneurs from across the continent met foreign leaders and business people from Africa, the US and beyond at the <a href=\"http://www.gesmarrakech2014.org/en/home\">Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES)</a> in Morocco. The theme of the summit was harnessing the power of technology for innovation and entrepreneurship. Technology, delegates were told, was not just a catalyst for economic growth but also could address “the most critical issues of our time”.</p> <p>In a keynote <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/20/remarks-vice-president-joe-biden-global-entrepreneurship-summit\">speech</a>, the US vice-president, Joe Biden, asked what could be done to help “brilliant young minds” and enable entrepreneurship to take deeper root. “America’s experience, like many others, teaches us that fostering entrepreneurship is not just about crafting the right economic policy, or developing the best educated curricula. It’s about creating an entire climate in which innovation and ideas flourish,” he said.</p> <p>This nod to the link between freedom and free enterprise resonates for Christian Ngan, Cameroonian founder of organic cosmetic group <a href=\"http://www.madlyncazalis.com/\">Madlyn Cazalis</a>, one of Forbes’s 30 most promising entrepreneurs in Africa and a speaker at the GES. Ngan says Africa is moving ahead and people are no longer afraid to speak out. As with Elumelu’s thoughts on development, he thinks the solution must come from within.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Young Africans are the promoters of their self-image to the world. We can talk with our own voice</p> <footer> <cite>Christian Ngan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“We first have to have a good image of ourselves, before asking other countries to have a good image of us. We have to be proud enough to believe in us … Young Africans are the promoters of their self-image to the world. We can talk with our own voice,” he said.<br /></p> <p>Elumelu argues that a vibrant, African-led private sector is the key to unlocking Africa’s economic and social potential. His programme aims to create an environment where entrepreneurs can get the support they need in the critical early days.</p> <p>Mwale also attended the GES and felt energised by the attention paid to African entrepreneurs and the desire expressed by Biden and others to help. “The fact that people are thinking at that level means that the time is for us,” he says. “We have the opportunities to attract the kind of people who are going to be able to create companies like Google.”</p> <p>He welcomes Elumelu’s initiative, but has a few concerns about the selection process, warning that high unemployment rates have led many young people to start businesses, not because of any particular passion but because they lack employment alternatives. </p> <p> “Running a startup or business is not easy and [the Elumelu programme managers] need to make sure that the people they support are going to be there until the very end. Only real entrepreneurs are going to stay even when the business is shaky,” he says.</p> <p>“Focusing on 10,000 entrepreneurs seems a little far-fetched to me ... The reality is the more people they handle the less effective their investment is per startup. I would rather they narrow down that number to 100 or even 1,000 startups that address real challenges and pressing needs in Africa and support them till they are mature enough.” </p> <p>Toyin Awesu, communications manager for the Elumelu fund, says the response had been amazing, and the first applicants would be selected in March. “The great thing about the programme is that it is very comprehensive. Ten thousand is a large number, but this is over 10 years. Each year we will accept 1,000 African entrepreneurs,” Awesu said. “So while it is indeed a huge task to fulfil, we are confident that as the programme continues our success stories will become our biggest advocates.”</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/17/1418841486308/3ea8fb2a-ac60-44f5-a591-dd1b7897e7b6-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/dec/26/next-generation-african-businesses-entrepreneurs","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2014/dec/26/next-generation-african-businesses-entrepreneurs","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"10 creative brand campaigns that have changed the way we live","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-22T09:46:36Z","sectionId":"media-network","id":"media-network/media-network-blog/2014/dec/22/brands-change-lives-think-act-creative","fields":{"body":"<p>Forget marketing stunts and gimmicks. The reason great brands have been able to drastically affect how millions - if not billions - of people behave is through creative actions. Here are 10 notable examples of how brands have used this approach to spell out what they stood for in the world.</p> <p>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHtvDA0W34I\" title=\"\">Red Bull Stratos (2012)</a><br />Stratos looks like a marketing stunt gone nuts. Yet it’s worth noting that Red Bull created little noise about themselves. By letting <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Baumgartner\" title=\"\">Felix Baumgartner</a> get the plaudits, Red Bull continued its tradition of celebrating the rebellious adventurer in all of us. In our sit-back-and-comment culture, Red Bull challenges us to get-up-and-be.</p> <p>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQo4VoLyHe0\" title=\"\">M-Pesa (2007)</a><br />Instead of a slick marketing campaign, mobile-payment service M-Pesa launched in Kenya in 2007 by getting its hands dirty, equipping a national network of small-store owners to offer the service, one agent at a time. Today, <a href=\"http://vc4africa.biz/blog/2014/01/15/m-pesa-and-beyond-why-mobile-money-worked-in-kenya-and-struggles-in-other-markets/\" title=\"\">70% of Kenyans use M-Pesa</a> to buy and sell all sorts of things. By doing this in a notoriously difficult market, M-Pesa has shamed banks and mobile phone companies in the West to do the hard work that makes mobile payment work for individuals, not the corporates.</p> <p>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0GyKQWMw6Q\" title=\"\">App store (2008)</a> / <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olOZCAu4v9E\" title=\"\">Android (2009)</a><br />Two different brands and two different creative approaches, but both have changed our lives in ways unimaginable 10 years ago. Today, one-man “teams” can compete with large organisations for that 120x120px space on your phone ushering in a golden age of creativity and design that is transforming industries across the spectrum.</p> <p>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuAPPeRg3Nw\" title=\"\">Channel 4 Paralympics: Meet the Superhumans (2012)</a><br />It’s easy to mistake Channel 4’s work for the <a href=\"http://www.paralympic.org/london-2012-overview\" title=\"\">London 2012 Paralympic Games</a> as another television commercial – until you see it. In your face, unapologetic and full of force, it turns our notion of disability on its head. This is not a sideshow to the main event. This is the superhuman version. And it has a cracking soundtrack too.</p> <p>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur2RITe7ETg\" title=\"\">Netflix Originals (2013)</a><br />With the the arrival of House of Cards, Orange is the New Black and the resuscitation of Arrested Development, Netflix made its most creative move yet, radically changing the role of television in our lives. And while the traditional TV industry clings to viewing schedules and advertising models, Netflix is giving us more control over the what, how and when of our content.</p> <p>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOrL5CnOAV8\" title=\"\">WeChat (2011)</a><br />While the world focuses on Silicon Valley, WeChat continues to build and expand on its radical mobile-first platform model that the West should consider emulating. Its <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-438-million-active-users-q2-2014/\" title=\"\">484 million users</a> help WeChat realise its core revenue from its one-stop shop offerings, which include everything from club memberships and avatars to shopping and dating services among others – not advertising.</p> <p>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ_JOBCLF-I\" title=\"\">The Lego Movie (2014)</a><br />Its blatant product placement is a subversive commentary on the genre. In making it, Lego flung down the gauntlet before all branded content makers to make content that – in the words of the BBC – not only sells but entertains, educates and informs.</p> <p>8. <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you\" title=\"\">Tesla Motors: Open Patents (2014)</a><br />Tesla’s jump into the open-source movement is a radical move in the world of cars. For an industry facing existential challenges, Tesla is at least helping move the needle forward, daring other car-makers to sift through the readily available intellectual property and do something meaningful with it.</p> <p>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5Ynz3eje9s\" title=\"\">Dove Campaign for Real Beauty (2004)</a><br />The Dove Campaign celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Dove has brilliantly inserted itself into meaningful conversations on beauty, body image and societal perceptions on women and contributed to pop culture colloquy with each execution.</p> <p>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_j4-Fm_Svs\" title=\"\">Smarter Planet by IBM (2008)</a><br />IBM used Smarter Planet to re-position itself as a mere computer manufacturer into a technology juggernaut with a strong social conscience. More than all the new players emerging from the West Coast, it can trace its roots back to 19th-century New York City and continues to lead the field in its abilty to express in clearly accessible terms the real impact technology can have in our lives.</p> <p><em>Ije Nwokorie is the CEO of </em><a href=\"http://www.wolffolins.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Wolff Olins.</em></a><em> He is a speaker at the </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2014/dec/02/changing-media-summit-2015-programme\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian’s Changing Media Summit 2015</em></a><em>. </em></p> <h2>More like this</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2014/nov/18/nike-benetton-ten-powerful-adverts\" title=\"\">From Nike to Benetton: 10 powerful adverts that changed the way we think</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2014/dec/10/brands-social-media-marketing-strategies-celebrities\" title=\"\">Brands on social media in 2014: the good, the bad and the ugly</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/oct/03/social-media-week-marketing-campaigns\" title=\"\">Five key takeaways from Social Media Week London 2014</a></p> <p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\" title=\"\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p> <p><em>All Guardian Media Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled “Brought to you by” – find out more </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418750129086/The-Lego-Movie-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/dec/22/brands-change-lives-think-act-creative","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/dec/22/brands-change-lives-think-act-creative","sectionName":"Media Network"},{"webTitle":"We have the legislation to convict British citizens who abuse children abroad – why don’t we use it more?","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-19T12:15:13Z","sectionId":"social-care-network","id":"social-care-network/2014/dec/19/simon-harris-british-citizens-child-abuse","fields":{"body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/16/paedophile-simon-harris-may-have-victims-beyond-kenya-police-warn\">trial and conviction of Simon Harris</a>, a 55-year-old teacher and former charity manager, for abusing Kenyan street children between 2002 and 2013, brought back a great sense of frustration and feelings of unfinished business. West Mercia police and the National Crime Agency spent much time and effort investigating Harris after a Channel 4 documentary raised alarms. Great credit to all of them, but this is the exception rather than the norm; the case was brought under legislation that first appeared on the statute books 17 years ago.</p> <p>Extra territorial legislation, the power to try British citizens in British courts for offences committed abroad, was the second part of the Sexual Offences Act that created the sex offenders register. Back in 1997, I spent time assisting Baroness Lucy Faithfull as she became one of the prime movers of this act, while seeing for myself the devastation caused to young lives and families by the actions of sex tourists from western industrialised countries.</p> <p>I vividly remember walking along the beachfront in Colombo, Sri Lanka’s capital, and within minutes being offered very young children of both sexes for less than the price of a pint of beer. The easy and obvious bit was to report it, interrupt it and do all possible to prevent children being exploited – which is what I’d always do. The difficult bit – and today the ingredients are much the same – was to realise that money, just to avoid abject poverty, was the driver.</p> <p>In Sri Lanka in the late 1990s there was no welfare and a family would have no income if they were not in any employment. So, if one child could bring food to the table, sometimes hunger overruled a safe childhood. Harris preyed on poor street children in Kenya in much the same way, exploiting their desperate need.</p> <p>The landscape gets more complicated though when you realise that we have the legislation to try British citizens but hardly ever use it, often far less than many of the other western nations with similar laws. The cost of forming and sustaining a successful prosecution is often quoted as a primary reason for failing to use this law. I’m sure that the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), the arm of the National Crime Agency responsible for investigating these crimes, would welcome the chance to pursue many, many more offenders they have intelligence on but there aren’t the staff or resources.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, I made a Freedom of Information request asking how many British men had been prosecuted under this legislation since its inception 17 years ago. I was told by the justice mnistry that they didn’t keep statistics on this and I’d have to ask every court in the country and then do the arithmetic! As it happens, I found out via ECPAT, among the best informed worldwide on sexual exploitation, that the true figure in the UK was about five.</p> <p>We have exported our sex offenders in their thousands over the years to decimate the childhood of vulnerable children in many countries. There is no guarantee that these men will not continue offending in the UK when they return. Safeguarding children is always described as a high priority, and if we pass laws we should use them. Resources are needed to create extra staff, education and intelligence gathering on a scale equivalent to a national disaster so Simon Harris and hundreds like him can’t abuse with impunity.</p> <p>Sixteen years ago, a lot of us put a great deal of work into what became the 1997 Sexual Offences Act, which has now been modified by the 2003 act.This had two principle parts. The first was the creation of the register of sex offenders which has continued to be a very valuable reference tool for the authorities to use in monitoring convicted offenders. The second part concerned extra territorial legislation: the ability for British courts to prosecute British citizens for offences committed abroad against children, if they weren’t being prosecuted in the country where it occurred.</p> <p>There are about 30,000 or more names on the sex offenders register today, but if the register had been made retrospective there would have been more than 250,000 names on it in 1997. People alive, mainly men, who had been convicted of a sexual offence. We have to accept the depth of offending in our community, while not unnecessarily scaring the population.</p> <p>Many UK nationals are still going abroad to offend against children. Some plan the whole trip. Others are seduced by the exotic locations and forget themselves. Organised crime plays a significant part; there’s big money to be earned by sexual exploitation.</p> <p>In 2000, I attended the first world congress on commercial sexual exploitation, held in Stockholm. There has been quite a lot of activity on the issue since, but I question if it has been maintained as effectively as it could be. Ceops in the UK do excellent work but they have limited resources. Europol and Interpol have improved communication systems and identification of victim systems but there’s still so much more to be done.</p> <p>Law enforcement seems to be just keeping up with offenders around the world and their increasingly sophisticated methods of exploiting children, but I’m not sure if the technology has advanced enough in the identification of victims to keep pace with the need.</p> <p>The late Baroness Lucy Faithfull put so much time and effort into achieving this legislation and we were delighted to help her. I think she needs a more robust legacy.</p> <p><strong>Why not join our social care community?

The aim is to “strive to provide universal and affordable access to internet in LDCs [least developed countries] by 2020”. </p> <p>Universal internet access is an enormous undertaking, yet thanks to the dynamics of the mobile market, progress is being made. The falling cost of smartphones is driving rapid uptake in the developing world. Around <a href=\"http://techpp.com/2014/01/28/one-billion-smartphones-2013/\">725m smartphones were sold in 2012, nearly 1bn in 2013</a>, and sales are expected to exceed 1bn for the first time in 2014. Most of this year’s 1bn-plus smartphones will ship to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/13/smartphone-explosion-2014-india-us-china-firefoxos-android\">emerging-market consumers</a>: 283 million in China, 225 million in India, 47 million in Brazil, and 46 million in Indonesia.</p> <p>In these countries, it is possible to buy an Android smartphone for around $30 (£19). These low-cost smartphones are already changing people’s lives in real, quantifiable ways. Examples are everywhere: from business, to education, to health.</p> <p>M-Pesa users in rural Kenya <a href=\"https://www.cgap.org/sites/default/files/CGAP-Brief-Poor-People-Using-Mobile-Financial-Services-Observations-on-Customer-Usage-and-Impact-from-M-PESA-Aug-2009.pdf\">report</a> that they have increased income by 30% by using mobile payment technology.

User behaviour can be analysed to reveal patterns and provide insight. Health organisations can analyse <a href=\"http://cloudtimes.org/2013/01/21/how-big-data-helps-abate-the-flu-epidemic/\">search patterns</a> to gauge when an influenza outbreak is coming; aggregated <a href=\"http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/twitter-an-early-disasterwarning-system\">social media</a> reports can provide early warning of a natural disaster. This data, used properly, can add considerable value to health and emergency services.</p> <p>Bring enough people online, and this all becomes possible. But to what extent can the United Nations – or any organisation – make universal internet access happen? </p> <p>In the developing world, governments have started to recognise the value of the mobile internet, and have acted to make smartphones more affordable. In <a href=\"http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2014/12/ghana-set-to-abolish-mobile-phone-tax/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+itnewsafrica+(ITNewsAfrica.com)\">Ghana</a>, government officials recently voted to remove import duties on smartphones, effectively slashing the cost of all devices by 35%. It will be interesting to see if this is as effective as the <a href=\"http://www.skmm.gov.my/Media/Press-Clippings/Registration-for-3G-smartphone-rebate-start-from-n.aspx\">rebate scheme</a> that Malaysia’s government has operated since 2012, which has provided discounted smartphones for millions of low-income youths.</p> <p>However, while smartphones are undoubtedly cheaper, the total cost of ownership is keeping many people offline. Right now, the biggest barrier is data cost.</p> <p>In the developing world, there are few unlimited data plans – most smartphone users pay for online access in increments, with pre-paid vouchers. The problem is that these data plans are prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>According to our recent <a href=\"http://www.jana.com/blog/the-data-trap/\">analysis</a> of data collected by McKinsey, the average 500MB data plan costs the equivalent of five days work in some countries. In India, an individual earning the minimum wage would have to work 18 hours to earn enough money to get online. In Nigeria, more than 28 hours. In Brazil and Mexico, the average 500MB smartphone plan costs the equivalent of 34 hours of minimum wage work.</p> <p>It’s no surprise that smartphone owners are reluctant to pay the price. Last year, <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2013/smartphones-keep-users-in-india-plugged-in.html\">a Nielsen study</a> of 10,000 smartphone users in India found that 50% had deactivated the internet capability of their phone.</p> <p>The fact that so many people can have access to a life-changing technology such as a smartphone, but cannot afford the basic functionality that makes it so empowering, is a serious issue.</p> <p>While governments act to cut device costs, most of the work to remove data costs is being done by actors in the private sector. <a href=\"https://internet.org/\">Internet.org</a> – an NGO backed by Facebook, among others – recently launched a mobile app in Zambia, Tanzania, and Kenya, providing free access to basic internet services. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/loon/\">Google’s Project Loon</a> may seem slightly far-fetched, but its scheme to beam down a kind of universal wifi from balloons in the stratosphere is <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/12/project_loon_how_google_s_internet_balloons_are_actually_working.html\">seeing positive results</a>. </p> <p>These are both ambitious and promising initiatives, yet to achieve significant progress by 2020, the United Nations must engage with the mobile landscape as it exists today. With the aim to improve internet access in developing countries, <a href=\"http://www.jana.com\">Jana</a> has partnered with 237 operators in 102 international markets. These are the actors that control the cost of data, and their involvement will be vital to achieving the goal of affordable internet access by 2020 and closing the information gap between the developed and developing worlds. </p> <p><em>Nathan Eagle is chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.jana.com/\">Jana</a>.

Plus going with The Guardian gives us kudos.</p> <p>The trip provides an opportunity for Plastic Castle to show the product in situ through simple tests to many customers rather than sending examples or samples, and the potential customers can see how the product fits into their product range and meet the people that will be delivering their solution. Such a trade mission would provide a platform for Plastic Castle to showcase this unique technology to potential customers at a much faster speed and in person.

This not only allowed the government to collect a higher royalty on exported diamonds, but created more jobs and spurred greater positive economic spillovers.

There was the Ponca lady, Casey Camp-Horinek, starting to cry as she spoke about the impacts of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”, on her people in what she called “occupied” Oklahoma in the US, and saying “We’re having a funeral a week... We’re this close to being fracked to death.” </p> <p>Then there was Kandi Mossett, from North Dakota, a fracking “victim who wasn’t able to come”. She appeared on the projector and broke down too, telling how “these radioactive frack socks [that are] off the charts on the Geiger counters” are being dumped and found by children who say things like, “Hey, we’re catching bugs with our nets.” </p> <p>That was right after Shannon Biggs, the executive director of Movement Rights, had explained that fracking in the US is destroying lives, livelihoods, groundwater, rivers, farms, prairies, communities and landscapes, as well as causing “earthquakes where earthquakes don’t exist” and poisoning “millions and millions and millions” of gallons of water that are “taken out of the hydrological cycle forever”.</p> <p>“[Fracking] is a total and utter form of destruction,” said Biggs, who calls Mossett’s indigenous territory “the most intensive fracking site” in the US. “You take land that is beautiful and full of life and vibrant with a dynamic sense of biodiversity, and we turn this landscape with fracking technology into waste land that is poisoned land [with] sick animals and sick human beings.”</p> <p>Camp-Horinek and Biggs were speaking before the International Tribunal for the Rights of Nature which met in Lima, Peru, on Friday and Saturday. The objective was to investigate cases of possible violations of the Rights of Nature as laid out in the Universal Declaration of Rights of Mother Earth made in Bolivia in 2010. </p> <p>In total 12 cases were heard, by 13 judges, with an Ecuadorian lawyer, Ramiro Avila, acting as “prosecutor for the earth” and numerous experts and impacted people from around the world called as witnesses. One such case was made against fracking for its impacts on “the subsoil of Mother Earth”, and another against “climate change caused by human activities” – just as the United Nations’ climate talks are being held elsewhere in Lima. </p> <p>According to Pablo Solón, a Bolivian from Focus on the Global South, the rising and acidifying oceans, biodiversity loss, desertification, forest fires and increasing number of extreme weather events caused by global warming constitute a “systematic violation of Mother Earth’s” rights. </p> <p>Solón was joined by Nnimmo Bassey, from Nigeria, who said that “business as usual means cooking Africa” and cited statistics of six million people displaced by floods in Africa in 2012 and a projected 54% increase in African civil wars by 2030 as a result of climate change. Bassey showed photos of a fisherman returning from work, both feet black with oil, and who now sells firewood.</p> <p>“He came back with nothing [that day],” Bassey told the Tribunal. “Livelihoods have been absolutely destroyed ... [Oil brings] disregard for people, for culture, for life, for everything.”</p> <p>The climate change case also included severe criticism of – and total opposition to – certain measures being considered and/or proposed by the UN, governments and companies as “solutions” to global warming. These included various geo-engineering technologies – described by Silvia Ribeiro from the ETC Group as a “very useful way” of avoiding addressing the fundamental causes of climate change – as well as “climate-smart agriculture” and carbon markets. </p> <p>“[They’re] basically a mechanism to cheat,” said Mary Lou Malig, from the Global Forest Coalition, about carbon markets. “It’s about enabling you to pollute. Instead of cutting your emissions, you increase them and pretend to reduce by offsetting.”</p> <p>Another case was made against “Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation” (Redd) – a concept which involves paying those who ostensibly reduce emissions by supposedly keeping forests standing, depending on how much carbon is stored in them. Criticism was as much about the principles and philosophy behind Redd as how it works in practice. </p> <p>Ninawa, an indigenous Kaxinawá man from Brazil, expressed concern about a Redd project in his home state, Acre, saying, “Nature has no price. It’s our forest, it’s our food, it’s our spirit.”</p> <p>Ruth Nyambura, from the African Biodiversity Network, said that indigenous Sengwer people in Kenya are being evicted from their land and having their houses burnt by the Kenya Forest Service because of a Redd project funded by the World Bank, and called it a “new form of conservation” and “colonization.”</p> <p>“This is not “management”, it is “government,”” she said. “We must reject the financialization of nature. We must reject Redd definitely.”</p> <p>Casandra Smithie went even further, citing a whole series of peoples who have struggled against, or have been threatened by, Redd and calling it a “crime against Mother Earth, Father Sky, and humanity.” The key perpetrators, she noted, such as the UN, the World Bank, extractive industries, multilateral banks, chemical companies, governments and stock exchanges, all have their headquarters in the industrialised northern countries.</p> <p>“[Redd gives] permits to pollute,” Smithie told the Tribunal. “[It means] forests of the world acting as a sponge for northern industrial countries’ pollution. They can pollute if they grab forests in the global south.”</p> <p>Other cases were made against “human activities” affecting the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the BP Deepwater Horizon blowout’s impacts on the “sea and living beings” in the Gulf of Mexico, the Belo Monte dam in Brazil for its impacts on the Xingu and Amazon rivers, Chevron-Texaco for oil operations in the Ecuadorian Amazon, oil exploitation affecting four river basins in the Peruvian Amazon, oil operations in the far east of the Yasuní National Park in Ecuador, the Mirador mine in Ecuador, the Conga mine in Peru, and mining and oil operations in the Bagua region in Peru. </p> <p>The UN climate talks, taking place elsewhere across Lima, came in for severe criticism at the Tribunal. Among other things, it was noted, by Malig, that agriculture isn’t up for negotiation, and that the UN is placing great hope in Redd – the “crime against humanity” which, according to Smithie, will be the “basis of the Paris accord”, i.e. the agreement for post-2020, when the Kyoto Protocol expires, that could be reached at next year’s UN climate talks in the French capital.</p> <p>The Tribunal responded to the hearings by emitting one damning sentence including the verdict that BP and both the Australian and Ecuadorian governments have violated the Rights of Nature, and by issuing a series of orders. These include that BP should abstain from any future deepwater exploration, that Australia should restrict tourism involving the Great Barrier Reef, that Ecuador should suspend Mirador and restore the impacted area, and that Chevron should comply with Ecuadorian court orders to restore damaged areas in the Amazon and pay financial compensation – a ruling that Chevron argued had been reached by fraud and racketeering and which it challenged by filing suit against the Ecuadorian plaintiffs and their lawyers.</p> <p>The Tribunal’s sentence also acknowledged statements made by Camp-Horinek and Patricia Gualinga, a Kichwa woman from Ecuador, about how the earth is a “living being” on which “all other living beings depend” and that it has a right to life, to respect, and to be consulted. </p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/10/1418214483541/1cc59c3c-6a8c-4600-a3c7-d458610c3c96-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2014/dec/10/fracking-redd-lima-climate-talks-slammed-nature-tribunal","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2014/dec/10/fracking-redd-lima-climate-talks-slammed-nature-tribunal","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Inside the 12 December edition","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-09T14:33:20Z","sectionId":"theguardian","id":"theguardian/2014/dec/09/garner-america-racial-divide-inside-guardian-weekly","fields":{"body":"<p>A short sequence of shaky video, a black man held in a chokehold by a white police officer, and a chilling phrase – “I can’t breathe” – have re-electrified anger and spurred reflection around racial disparity in the United States.</p> <p>The decision last week by a grand jury not to indict the officer over the death of Eric Garner has again highlighted the tensions between black Americans and the largely white law enforcement teams that patrol their neighbourhoods.

This is only the latest in a wave of violent incidents heightening insecurity along the remote Somali-Kenyan border.</p> <p>The north-east is one of the poorest regions in Kenya. Weak infrastructure and limited public services are exacerbated by banditry and insurgency. The national primary school enrolment rate is over 90%, but in the north-east it is below 40%. <br /></p> <p>It is clear that despite insecurity, development and investment must continue. But how can donors be confident their money is well spent if locations are inaccessible to most implementing partners? If donors can’t see results, they are unlikely to reinvest. <br /></p> <p>Remote and insecure locations are often the areas with the greatest (and most critical) needs. As such, there is an urgent demand for improved monitoring tools that give insight into the effectiveness of aid in challenging environments. A possible answer is the use of technology.

Data-enabled photos taken by the community and partners clearly show donors the various stages of construction, which are collated, mapped and compared against targets. <br /></p> <p>Whilst remote data collection should not be an alternative to direct engagement, it is a robust management tool when direct donor engagement is not possible. </p> <p><strong>Content managed and produced by Adam Smith International</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418130883673/459b2249-0b79-41c7-bec7-f2d77ec38fb6-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/adam-smith-international-partner-zone/2014/dec/08/accessing-the-inaccessible","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/adam-smith-international-partner-zone/2014/dec/08/accessing-the-inaccessible","sectionName":"Adam Smith International partner zone"},{"webTitle":"Redefining India's banks: who will benefit?","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-04T14:56:44Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/04/reserve-bank-of-india-payment-banks","fields":{"body":"<p>A shortage of bricks-and-mortar banks in India has forced the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to redefine banking, with the central bank announcing it will offer licences to companies – from supermarket chains to real estate cooperatives – that are interested in opening their own bank.</p> <p>Under the <a href=\"http://rbi.org.in/scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=2900\">guidelines</a> issued last week, RBI wants payment banks to target India’s migrant labourers, low-income households and small businesses, offering savings accounts and remittance services with a low transaction cost. </p> <p>Designed to reach the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/18/business/vodafone-india-mobile-pesa-700-million/\">700 million</a> unbanked Indians, any interested organisation must commit to setting up at least 25% of its physical access points in rural communities. This is an interesting development, considering that rural branches of Indian banks <a href=\"http://www.livemint.com/Industry/ZXasKQDiNw7aHazLjVKvcJ/Rural-areas-continue-to-be-ignored-by-banks-RBI.html\">have declined from 54% of total branches</a> in 1994 to 37% in 2013. </p> <p>In the past, established banks have shown reluctance to expand their countryside operations when their current rural branches are already hit by high costs, poor connectivity and low savings in areas where the average per capita income is around 16,000 rupees, <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/01/21/india-banks-cash-transfer-sbi-idINDEE90K00M20130121\">compared with 44,000 rupees in urban areas</a>.</p> <p>However, mobile money operators are likely to be among the biggest players to benefit from RBI’s initiative as they can already offer similar services and, if approved as a payment bank, this will be the first time they will be able to offer cash withdrawals to customers. Traditionally, money sent from the city to the village has either got stuck in a mobile money account or has had to be transferred to a bank account, which more than <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-28962762\">two-thirds</a> of the population doesn’t have.</p> <p>Acknowledging the high saturation of mobile phones in the country (more than <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/26293516\">900 million phone subscribers</a>), Raghuram Rajan, the RBI governor, has argued that banks no longer have to be limited to a place and thus, regulations need to be more flexible with these new platforms. </p> <p>“Today, place need not mean physical proximity, it can mean electronic proximity, or proximity via correspondents,” he said at a lecture in August in Mumbai. Indeed, the guidelines for payment banks ask applicants to demonstrate how they would leverage technology to offer low-cost banking solutions.<br /></p> <p>Arun Gore, president and CEO of Gray Ghost of <a href=\"http://www.grayghostventures.com/\">Gray Ghost Ventures</a>, a venture fund for mobile solutions in emerging markets, is thrilled by payment banks. <a href=\"http://www.beam.co.in/\">Beam</a>, one of their companies, already offers a host of financial services through mobiles to Indian consumers, enabling them to book train tickets, send remittances and pay bills. That’s why Gore sees companies like Beam as best suited to become payment banks. Companies have to apply for a payment bank licence before 16 January and Beam founder, Anand Srivastava, is keen to file.</p> <p>While Gore is a bit apprehensive about which companies the central bank will decide to qualify as payment banks, he says: “These mobile money companies have the experience, expertise and technology already. And this is ultimately, a technology solution.”</p> <p>The opportunity to become payment banks is also seen as a way to revitalise India’s mobile money industry, which due to tight regulation, has not penetrated the country as widely as expected. Being able to offer cash withdrawals as a payment bank, Srivastava estimates, could increase Beam’s customer base from 17 million to more than 100 million users in the next three years.</p> <p>Payment banks will need to abide by a few basic rules, though. They cannot exceed a balance of 100,000 rupees per customer, can invest only in government securities and bonds and will not be able to lend or offer credit cards. </p> <p> Shashank Joshi, the founder of <a href=\"http://www.money-on-mobile.net/\">Money on Mobile</a>, the largest mobile money operator in India, is also excited by the prospect of becoming a bank. “Indian regulators are very careful, so they move slowly, taking one step at time,” he says, “but, payment banks, I think, will be able to lend down the road.”</p> <p>While payment banks sound like an ideal solution to India’s struggling mobile money industry and huge unbanked population, the <a href=\"http://www.iba.org.in/\">Indian Banks Association </a>has protested against the concept, arguing that it will be hard for payment banks to make money (and be viable) without lending.</p> <p>Joshii sees it differently. He says granting non-banks a banking licence will allow them to tap into new customers in remote rural areas, where bricks-and-mortar banks are limited anyway. “We’re not going to be poaching bank customers, but exploring unchartered territories.”</p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this</strong>:<br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/nov/12/bangledesh-working-children-bank-accounts\">Bangladesh Bank makes financial inclusion for street kids child’s play</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/09/india-microfinance-disability-inclusion-discrimination\">Blindness shouldn’t be a barrier to banking: ending discrimination in India</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/02/mpesa-safaricom-equity-bank-financial-inclusion-kenya\">Watch out M-Pesa, Equity Bank wants to transform mobile money in Kenya</a></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Rather than the private sector seeing investing in health research as just part of their corporate social responsibility strategy, they should be part of actual innovations or research and implementation, so if there’s any failure or success then it is shared. <strong> </strong><em>Dr Solomon Nwaka, executive director,<a href=\"http://www.andi-africa.org\"> African Network for Drugs and Diagnostics Innovation (Andi)</a>, Geneva, Switzerland</em></p> <p><strong>Open up the medicines market: </strong>Vaccines helped show a new path.

It’s not at all clear this was the case: as recently as 2009, a Home Office consultation noted: “And overseas companies outside UK jurisdiction are not required to disclose data under Ripa and not required to retain the data under the EU data retention directive.”</li> <li>As such, trying to extend Ripa to cover companies globally potentially represents a significant power grab by the agencies, and by the UK – one which may not be well received by some of the UK’s allies in Europe and beyond.<br /></li> <li><strong>MI5 is largely absolved of responsibility for Lee Rigby’s murder, in part due to the difficulty of attempting to track around 2,000 people of interest at one time. Technology companies are not extended quite the same understanding</strong>, despite having hundreds of millions of – or in Facebook’s case, over a billion – users. The report not only suggests such companies should comply with UK surveillance requests, but should proactively seek out terrorists in their own network. One senior technology company staffer said this was unreasonable, asking: “Could you imagine them asking the same thing of BT?”<br /></li> <li>There is a final question mark around the agencies’ public responses to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\">the Snowden revelations</a>, which began after Rigby’s murder in Woolwich. GCHQ officials, the Home Office and others complained technology companies were not cooperating with some requests, and that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2013/nov/07/mi6-uksecurity\">encryption meant some communications were “going dark”</a>. They laid the blame for both at Snowden’s door. But responses from the agencies to the ISC show they were already, prior to Snowden, complaining that technology companies needed to hand over more information, and said strong encryption was already being introduced for other reasons. Given both trends pre-existed, it could leave the agencies open to the suggestion of a degree of opportunism in their responses.<br /></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5474bc4fe4b0bf2ade60cdbd\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T17:30:00.408Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Facebook statement</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A spokesperson for Facebook has given the Guardian this statement on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-5474b71fe4b08fbd11e1ad84\">claims that it is the company accused in the ISC report</a> of failing to pass on information about extremist messages sent by Michael Adebowale:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like everyone else, we were horrified by the vicious murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.</p> <p>We don’t comment on individual cases but Facebook’s policies are clear: we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full report is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/25/facebook-thought-to-be-tech-firm-at-the-heart-of-lee-rigby-accusations\">here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T17:31:41.996Z\">at 5.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5474b71fe4b08fbd11e1ad84\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T17:15:19.424Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-5474b4f3e4b0bf2ade60cdb4\">Facebook is the previously unnamed internet company</a> accused by the ISC today of failing to pass on information about one of Lee Rigby’s killers.</p> <p><strong>Alex Hern</strong> reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Facebook is the internet company accused by the intelligence and security committee (ISC) of failing to pass on information that could have prevented the murder of Lee Rigby, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>The ISC investigation found that one of Rigby’s killers, Michael Adebowale, conducted an online exchange <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-54746808e4b08fbd11e1acd4\">detailing his desire to murder a soldier ‘in the most graphic and emotive manner’</a> with a known terrorist, five months before the attack, yet did not directly name the company concerned.</p> <p>‘The party which could have made a difference was the company on whose platform the exchange took place,’ <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-5474630ee4b05735abcbf39a\">states the report</a>. ‘However, this company does not appear to regard itself as under any obligation to ensure that its systems identify such exchanges, or to take action or notify the authorities when its communications services appear to be used by terrorists.</p> <p>‘There is therefore a risk that, however unintentionally, it provides a safe haven for terrorists to communicate within,’ <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-547460d2e4b012ac8415b192\">it states</a>.<em><br /></em></p> <p>The report does not name which US tech service Adebowale used, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-547473e1e4b08fbd11e1acf2\">but at various points the 191-page report mentions Apple, BlackBerry, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo</a> when giving examples of monitoring procedures.<br /></p> <p>The Guardian undestands the company in question is Facebook. </p> <p>The report details 11 accounts run by Adebowale, with seven of those disabled by the company concerned and one closed by Adebowale himself.<br /></p> <p>The ISC’s report says that the technology company closed the accounts in an automated manner for violation of the company’s terms of service.

That was the exchange – not seen until after the attack – between Adebowale and an individual overseas [known as Foxtrot] in December 2012. In this exchange, Adebowale told Foxtrot that he intended to murder a soldier.</p> <p>“Had MI5 access to this exchange, their investigation into Adebowale would have become top priority. It is difficult to speculate on the outcome but there is a significant possibility that MI5 would then have been able to prevent the attack.”</p> <p>That was the conclusion of the intelligence and security committee, which also agreed that agencies could not themselves have obtained access to this information under current rules, as Adebowale was not under active investigation at the time.<br /></p> <p>“The party which could have made a difference was the company on whose platform the exchange took place. However, <strong>this company does not appear to regard itself as under any obligation to ensure that its systems identify such exchanges, or to take action or notify the authorities when its communications services appear to be used by terrorists</strong>.</p> <p>“There is therefore a risk that, however unintentionally, it provides a safe haven for terrorists to communicate within,” the report says.<br /></p> <p>In a further twist that seeks to shift responsibility to the internet companies, the report says that US internet providers do not feel compelled to comply with UK warrants seeking data.<br /></p> <p>The exact nature of the exchange of information between US and UK agencies is a matter of debate. The committee acknowledges that UK agencies which work closely with the US intelligence agencies can still get access. The fact that US internet providers “do recognise the jurisdiction of the US courts means that the UK agencies or law enforcement can, in certain limited circumstances, ask their US partners to apply to the US courts for authorisation to obtain and share the relevant material with the UK”.</p> <p>However, the report adds: “In practice this is limited by the US courts to high priority investigations where there is a known threat to life.” The implication is that MI5 would not have been able to get information on an individual who in this case was regarded as low priority.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5474a40fe4b0111029b6799d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T15:45:31.495Z\">3.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read the latest Guardian report on today’s developments <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-report-internet-firms-safe-haven-terrorists-pm\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5474a0e2e4b012ac8415b224\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T15:43:45.135Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-547473e1e4b08fbd11e1acf2\">internet companies mentioned in the report</a> (the firm at the centre of the claim that it should have intervened on Adebowale’s messages <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-547460d2e4b012ac8415b192\">is unnamed</a>) have not commented on the ISC findings – Facebook is the latest to tell the Guardian it won’t be making a statement – others in the field are pushing back at the recommendation that online activity ought to be more rigorously policed by service providers.</p> <p><strong>Antony Walker, deputy CEO at techUK</strong>, the industry body, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tech companies take their security responsibilities incredibly seriously.

The only way to address these issues is by brokering diplomatic agreements and processes between governments. The report rightly focuses on the importance of the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) process for providing a legal framework that enables companies based outside the UK to respond to access to data from UK agencies without the risk of contravening their own domestic law. This is best achieved diplomatic negation between national governments and in consultation with companies and other stakeholders …<br /></p> <p><strong>If the government believes that it needs additional powers to be able to access communication data it must be clear about exactly what those powers are and consult widely on them before putting proposals before parliament</strong>.<br /></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54749df9e4b0bf2ade60cd9e\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T15:29:51.989Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The role of the agencies: errors and surveillance</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ewen MacAskill, </strong>the Guardian’s defence and intelligence correspondent, has been combing the ISC report and sends this dispatch on what it has to say about the way the security services dealt with Adebolajo and Adebowale when evidence of their extremism emerged ahead of the murder.</p> <p>The report praises the agencies for protecting the UK from a number of terrorist plots, averaging about one or two serious intended attacks a year:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nevertheless, when there is a terrorist attack, it is essential that there is a thorough investigation to establish whether mistakes have been made and to ensure that any lessons are learned.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here’s what the report says about MI5’s missed opportunities:</p> <h2>Surveillance</h2> <p>As the main domestic surveillance agency, MI5 had responsibility for keeping tabs on Adebolajo and Adebowale.</p> <p>Adebolajo, viewed as more of a priority than Adebowale, was caught up in MI5 investigations on five separate occasions, beginning with Operation Ash from May to September 2008. Concern was sparked after contact with a network suspected of terrorist links.</p> <p>Adebolajo was caught up in four further surveillance operations – Operation Beech, Operation Cedar, Operation Dogwood and Operation Elm – before the Woolwich attack.<br /></p> <p>Adebowale was investigated by MI5 on two separate occasions: Operation Fir from August 2011 to June 2012, looking at links between UK-based individuals with an interest in extremist media; and Operation Gum, from January 2012 up until the Woolwich attack, looking at his extremist rhetoric and potential dissemination of extremist media.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa16f92a0bd9479a733bfbd7767a9c0376ceea82\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416929107401/5049d706-2c25-49ac-9271-0f56553ee088-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) after they murdered British soldier Lee Rigby.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) after they murdered British soldier Lee Rigby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Errors</h2> <p>Various errors were made, such as failure to follow up on recommendations to gather more information about Adebolajo. The committee expressed surprise that MI5 did not place one or both of the men under surveillance or increase the surveillance.</p> <p>The report says that MI5 has limited resources and has to prioritise its investigations. Adebowale was regarded as low priority and, as a result, there were significant and unacceptable delays in investigating him.</p> <p>The report says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst we have concluded that the errors identified would not, individually, have affected the outcome, we have also considered whether there was a cumulative effect – i.e. whether, taken together, they might have made a difference. We do know that they would have led to different investigative decisions.</p> <p>However, it is impossible to conclude that those changes – all dependent on one another – would have resulted in MI5 discovering evidence of attack planning. We do not consider that, given what the agencies knew at the time, they were in a position to prevent the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.</p> <p>There are those who feel that the intelligence and security agencies have too much power to intrude into an individual’s privacy. However, when a terrorist attack happens, the question often asked is why the agencies did not do more to prevent it. The balance between these two concerns is one that we are considering further in our separate inquiry into privacy and security issues.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54748faae4b012ac8415b1f9\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T14:40:31.144Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MPs on the intelligence and security committee have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-5474630ee4b05735abcbf39a\">published their report</a> on the dealings of the security services with the killers of Lee Rigby, the soldier killed on the streets of Woolwich last year.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Security agencies could not have prevented the murder, despite the two killers having appeared in seven separate investigations, </strong>the report finds. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2014/nov/25/lee-rigby-woolwich-inquiry-report-published-live-coverage#block-5474676de4b08fbd11e1acd1\">It identifies “errors” by MI5</a> “where processes were not followed, decisions not recorded or delays encountered”, and describes as “inadequate” the response of MI6 in dealing with Adebolajo.

The scale of the problem indicates that<strong> the government’s counter-terrorism programmes are not working</strong>. Successfully diverting individuals from the radicalisation path is essential, yet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/05/gove-may-prevent-debate-counter-terrorism\">Prevent programmes</a> have not been given sufficient priority.</p> <p>In the same context, we have also considered SIS’s [secret intelligence service] work to disrupt the link between UK extremists and terrorist organisations overseas. In the case of Adebolajo – a British citizen arrested overseas and suspected of trying to join a terrorist organisation – <strong>SIS’s response was inadequate</strong>. They considered deportation (or voluntary departure) to be a sufficient solution; they failed to investigate his allegations of mistreatment; and neither they nor MI5 accorded him sufficient priority upon his return to the UK. Given the current situation in Syria and Iraq, we have very significant concerns in this regard.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T12:15:45.287Z\">at 12.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54746f5de4b05735abcbf3af\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T12:02:09.128Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here’s more from the committee on its claim that internet companies – particularly those based outside the UK – are “providing a safe haven for terrorists”:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>None of the major US companies we approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems, largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content.

In a press notice, he goes so far as to say that internet companies ‘appear to accept no responsibility for the services they provide’. He adds: ‘This is of very serious concern: the capability of the [security and intelligence] agencies to access the communications of their targets is essential to their ability to detect and prevent terrorist threats in the UK.’</p> <p>In a remarkably blunt fashion, Rifkind and his committee thus appear to come close to blaming internet companies for Rigby’s murder. The companies have been a chief target of MI5 and GCHQ, strongly backed by Theresa May and senior Home Office officials.</p> <p>The message was rammed home by GCHQ’s new director, Robert Hannigan, who <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c89b6c58-6342-11e4-8a63-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3K51m9TLF\">in a column in the Financial Times</a> early this month described web giants such as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp as ‘command-and-control networks … for terrorists and criminals’.</p> <p>The companies are under extreme pressure to provide their data with the least possible control and oversight. Whitehall officials have indicated that if the companies do not cooperate more with MI5 and GCHQ then they will force them to or get the data by the back door – a message that will not have been lost on China and Russia.</p> <p><strong>Edward’s Snowden’s disclosures make clear GCHQ already has direct access to internet communications.</strong></p> <p>The committee does criticise MI5’s procedures and processes in a way that reflects <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/london-terrorist-attacks-on-77-review-of-the-intelligence\">its report on the 7/7 London underground and bus bombings in July 2005</a>. It sharply attacks MI6 for failing to pursue Michael Adebolajo and says neither MI5 nor MI6 accorded him ‘sufficient priority’ when he returned to the UK from Kenya.</p> <p>But there is no doubt where the committee wants to place the blame – at the door of the internet companies.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T11:54:48.715Z\">at 11.54am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54746a7ae4b08fbd11e1acd9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T11:43:56.774Z\">11.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Haroon Siddique</strong> is in Woolwich, the site of Lee Rigby’s murder, and has been talking to people close to the barracks where the soldier was based.</p> <p>Enda Mcniffe, a 22-year-old student who has lived in Woolwich all his life, and was this morning walking past the spot where Drummer Rugby was killed, said</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From what I read at the time, there was information circulating about [the killers before the murder] and I thought it could have been acted on a bit more.</p> <p>But it was going to happen, if not to poor Lee Rigby then to someone else.</p> </blockquote> <p>McNiffe agreed with the finding that an internet company should have reported online threats made by one of the killers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It’s got to report it if you’re talking about public safety.

The security services should focus their efforts on the targeted surveillance of individuals like Michael Adebolajo rather than continuing to monitor every citizen in the UK.</p> <p>Mass surveillance erodes the basic trust between citizen and state by treating us all as suspects.

Here are the key passages; the highlighting is mine:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the attack, information was provided to GCHQ by a third party revealing a substantial online exchange between Adebowale and FOXTROT (an extremist thought to have links with AQAP) in December 2012, in which Adebowale expressed his desire to murder a soldier in the most explicit and emotive manner …</p> <p>The company on whose systems this exchange took place had not been aware of the exchange prior to the attack. However, they had previously closed some of Adebowale’s accounts because their automated system deemed them to be associated with terrorism – yet they neither reviewed those accounts nor passed any information to the authorities. </p> <p><strong>We take the view that, when possible links to terrorism trigger accounts to be closed, the company concerned – and other communications service providers – should accept their responsibility to review these accounts immediately and, if such reviews provide evidence of specific intention to commit a terrorist act, they should pass this information to the appropriate authority. </strong></p> <p>It has been difficult to gain a clear understanding from GCHQ and the company of exactly what happened in this particular case. The monitoring process used by the company is still not sufficiently clear to the committee or, it appears, to GCHQ. On the basis of the evidence we have received,<strong> the company does not have procedures to prevent terrorists from planning attacks using its networks. </strong></p> <p>We have explored whether it would have been possible, theoretically, for the agencies to have accessed Adebowale’s exchange with FOXTROT before the attack, had they sought to do so. Given the number of variables concerned, we consider that <strong>access would have been possible but unlikely without the co-operation of the company concerned</strong>. </p> <p>Adebowale’s expressed intention to murder a soldier was highly significant. If Adebowale’s exchange with FOXTROT had been seen by MI5 at the time, then we believe that the investigation would have increased to Priority 1, unlocking all the extra resources this would have entailed. This is the single issue which – had it been known at the time – might have enabled MI5 to prevent the attack.</p> <p>We note that several of the companies ascribed their failure to review suspicious content to the volume of material on their systems. Whilst there may be practical difficulties involved, <strong>the companies should accept they have a responsibility to notify the relevant authorities when an automatic trigger indicating terrorism is activated and allow the authorities, whether US or UK, to take the next step</strong>. We further note that several of the companies attributed the lack of monitoring to the need to protect their users’ privacy. However, where there is a possibility that a terrorist atrocity is being planned, that argument should not be allowed to prevail.</p> <p>The capability of the agencies to access the communications of their targets is essential to their ability to detect and prevent terrorist threats to the UK and our allies.<strong> The considerable difficulty that the agencies face in accessing the content of online communications, both in the UK and overseas, from providers which are based in the US – such as Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo – is therefore of great concern. </strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5474676de4b08fbd11e1acd1\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T11:28:29.434Z\">11.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Report's key findings</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the key findings identified by the ISC in the introduction to its report:</p> <ul> <li>The two men appeared, between them, in seven different agency investigations – for the most part as low-level subjects of interest (SoI). <strong>There were errors in these operations, where processes were not followed, decisions not recorded, or delays encountered.

But the group was arrested after a tipoff and taken into custody.</p> <p>Adebolajo was eventually deported after he alleged he was tortured during his period in detention. The Kenyans have said they warned the British that he was a dangerous extremist. It has also emerged that there were apparent sightings of Adebolajo in October of that year at the Musa mosque in Mombasa, where the extremist cleric Sheikh Aboud Rogo preached weekly. Rogo was suspected of funding the group’s plan to join al-Shabaab.</p> <p>On his return to the UK, Adebolajo’s family say, he was approached by the security service, which attempted to recruit him as an informant. Relatives also say they were approached. But the suspected extremist was not put under surveillance or considered a candidate for either a terrorism prevention and investigation measure (TPIM), or the Channel programme, which attempts to deradicalise individuals …<br /></p> <p>Adebolajo was considered to be at the bottom of a pyramid of several thousand people on the security service radar. More intensive scrutiny, carried out with the necessary warrants and agreement of the home secretary, is only targeted at those people at the very top of the pyramid, where there is sufficient intelligence to justify it, the Guardian was told.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54745782e4b08fbd11e1acb3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-11-25T10:27:13.713Z\">10.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the letter that Abu Nusaybah, also known as Ibrahim Hassan, sent to Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chair of the ISC, last year.

Adebolajo has alleged that there was British complicity in his ill-treatment after he was arrested in Kenya in 2010.</p> <p>His brother, Jeremiah, who was working at a university in Saudi Arabia, claimed he had also been approached and pressed by MI6 for information.</p> <p>Adebolajo and <strong>Michael Adebowale</strong>, both converts to Islam, had been known to the security services for up to eight years before the attack. Adebolajo <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/29/woolwich-suspect-adebolajo-somalia-arrest\">went to Kenya in 2010</a>, where he was arrested as he attempted to join extremists in Somalia, and was released in murky circumstances to return to the UK.<br /></p> <p>A friend of his, <strong>Abu Nusaybah, </strong>also known as<strong> Ibrahim Hassan</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22664468\">later went on television to claim Adebolajo had been tortured in Kenya and harassed by MI5</a> – which asked him to spy for it on his return. Nusaybah was arrested after making these claims and later convicted of terrorist offences.</p> <p>After his arrest Nusaybah wrote from his cell to the ISC’s chair, <strong>Sir Malcolm Rifkind</strong>: ‘I implore you to investigate any connection between the UK and Kenyan authorities in the mistreatment of Michael Adebolajo … I am witness to the fact that the Michael I knew ceased to exist after his treatment in Kenya.’</p> <p>Tasnime Akunjee, solicitor for Nusaybah, said: ‘They are precisely the kind of people you need to speak to.

I’m not talking about the well-equipped loos available to us as we soar 39,000 feet into the sky, complete with soft loo roll, airline-branded soap and hand dryers. No, flying toilets are the outcome of people forced to go to the loo in a bag before throwing it into the streets because no better option exists. </p> <p>According to the UN, 2.5 billion people in the developing world lack what many of us take for granted - access to a toilet. As a result, human faeces ends up on the roadside, in drinking water and eventually in people’s stomachs. The outcome is diarrhoea. Second only to pneumonia in its destructiveness, diarrhoea kills more than <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/health/files/Final_Diarrhoea_Report_October_2009_final.pdf\">4,000 children a day</a> (pdf), yet gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to the likes of cholera, TB and measles, says Rose George, author of The Big Necessity.</p> <p>George suggests that “waste” is actually a misnomer since human faeces is an inexhaustible source of valuable nutrients. The idea of value when it comes to excretion may be hard to grasp for some, but in parts of the world where access to decent sanitation is limited and opportunities for generating income are slim, there is an urgency that drives the creation of opportunities.</p> <p>Take <a href=\"http://saner.gy/\">Sanergy</a>, a Kenyan-based enterprise building a network of low cost, hygienic waterless toilets in east Africa’s urban slums. For a $500 one off payment, Fresh Life Toilets are franchised to residents, who operate them as businesses by charging a small fee to users. </p> <p>Sanergy collects the waste and converts it into nutrient-rich organic fertiliser which is then sold on to Kenyan farmers. To date, Sanergy has launched 555 toilets to a network of 270 Fresh Life operators serving 25,000 people a day while safely removing more than seven tonnes of waste from communities daily.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61639b24916fc66e5dc67b1e5ef99ba8264d4628\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/19/1416408511426/913e7b58-740b-43b8-afba-d52b7017cc2c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sanergy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanergy provides waterless toilets to impoverished communities in east Africa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sanergy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Uncertain about an organisation profiting from poo? Consider this: 74% of Kenyans <a href=\"http://inequalities.sidint.net/kenya/abridged/sanitation/\">use traditional pit latrines</a> - the sanitation problems of which, if badly maintained, have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/01/concrete-solutions-world-sanitation-problems\">well documented</a> - and they usually have to pay. Likewise, the cost of emptying these pits can be high.<br /></p> <p>In turn, the franchise provides income for local entrepreneurs who can access direct financing from a local microfinance bank to get started. Most importantly, Fresh Life Toilets are addressing an immediate need for better sanitation, reducing rates of diarrhoea at very low cost to the community.</p> <p>According to co-founder David Auerbach, not using water makes Sanergy possible:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Waterless toilets offer a solution that ensures waste is concentrated, which enables Sanergy to process the waste into valuable by-products with greater efficiency. In an area where water is expensive and a limited resource, waterless toilets are a cost-effective solution.</p> </blockquote> <p>Like Sanergy, UK-based <a href=\"http://www.loowatt.com/\">Loowatt</a> has also developed a hygienic waterless toilet system, although this one also generates energy. The odourless Loowatt toilet uses a sealing mechanism to wrap human waste in a biodegradable liner which is pulled through the sealer when the toilet is flushed. The “cartridge” is then emptied periodically into an anaerobic digester, where the waste and biodegradable liners are converted into biogas and fertiliser. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc3f19270e9ab11cdcfde8220ecf4fe7ba0d586a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/19/1416408418432/4b44abff-f63f-440c-b9b5-7233e4489a7a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Loowatt\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loowatt’s waterless, energy-generating toilet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loowatt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since 2012, Loowatt has been rolling out its sanitation system at its pilot project in Antananarivo, Madagascar. There, a public toilet is linked to a micro-scale digester which provides energy onsite, although as the project expands the toilets will be linked to larger digesters operated by the local government or private operators. Using this model, the Loowatt team is working on toilet solutions for disaster relief.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.waterlesstoilets.co.uk/\">Woo Woo</a> is a London-based company that installs dehydrating toilets for UK clients without access to mains sewerage, such as allotments. With Woo Woo loos, no extra materials are required since the design enables sunlight and wind alone to turn human waste into a compost-like material. </p> <p>“The idea that you could solve sanitation issues with a water-driven toilet is hilarious to me,” says Woo Woo founder James Young. “It’s not going to happen, and that’s just based on water supply. After that you have to build the methods of getting the waste away, and treating it. If someone can crack the waterless toilet by making it affordable and aspirational to everyone, it’s going to make hundreds of millions of lives better.”</p> <p>Disappointingly, national governments and international organisations are failing populations by not realising the far-reaching potential of waterless toilets. These innovative projects are setting an inspiring example - without support, however, there’s a danger they will remain a mere plop in the ocean. <br /></p> <p><em>This article was amended on 20 November.</em> <em>Sanergy’s Fresh Life Toilet unit costs $500, which is a one-time payment only and not every year as previously stated.</em><strong><br /></strong></p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/19/world-toilet-day-business-coalition-open-defecation\">World Toilet Day: business steps in to tackle open defecation with affordable toilets</a><br /></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/18/cities-nature-bridge-investment-gap-water-sector\">Cities should look to nature to bridge investment gap in water sector </a></li> <li>Brought to you by Grundfos: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/grundfos-partner-zone/2014/nov/11/new-water-treatment-technology-reduces-risks-from-hospital-wastewater\">New water treatment technology reduces risks from hospital wastewater</a> </li> </ul> <p><em>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/hubs-water\">water hub</a> is funded by Grundfos.

This means that they do not have access to basic financial services, such as savings, bank accounts, or credit. The majority are women. If financial inclusion as a goal is not tabled on the international agenda, we will lack concerted efforts to ensure that systemic factors that exclude the rural and under-served segments are eliminated. <em>Saloni Korlimarla, mobile technology programme manager, <a href=\"http://www.cherieblairfoundation.org/\">Cherie Blair Foundation for Women</a>, London, UK, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/salonikor\">@salonikor</a></em></p> <p><strong>Making it a goal means it will attract resources:</strong> Only by being a goal in its own right can we focus enough energy and resources into making sure services are available. Financial inclusion is a huge enabler of impact for smallholder farmers, but credit alone is insufficient. It needs to be bundled with other services (such as training) to maximise the impact on livelihoods.<em> Mike Warmington, microfinance partnerships manager, <a href=\"http://www.oneacrefund.org/\">One Acre Fund</a>, London, UK, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OneAcreFund\">@oneacrefund</a></em></p> <p><strong>Individuals are limited without finance: </strong>The sustainable development goals are about unlocking the bottlenecks that are preventing individuals from reaching their potential – access to education, access to water/sanitation, global health challenges. Of course financial inclusion deserves a place among these goals. Access to finance can enable so many opportunities and without it, individuals are severely limited. <em>Payal Dalal, head of education and girls programmes, <a href=\"https://www.sc.com/\">Standard Chartered Bank</a>, London, UK, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pdalal\">@pdalal</a></em></p> <p><strong>Development is all about economic development:</strong> The economic development of a country is absolutely central to everything else and I believe that’s why it should be a goal in its own right. Business, education, mortgage and infrastructure loans; savings accounts and pensions; life, health, accident and property insurance have been essential to long-term and sustained economic growth in every country in the world. We should point out these facts to the development community and challenge them to dispute economic history in developed countries.<em> Dennis Ripley, chief business development officer, <a href=\"http://opportunity.org/\">Opportunity International</a>, Chicago, USA, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/opportunityintl\">@OpportunityIntl</a></em></p> <p><strong>Mobile money transforms lives:</strong> I believe that financial inclusion is a goal in its own right, and it is mobile money technology that will allow financial inclusion to reach it’s full potential. For example, in Ghana today, a grandfather who lives in the countryside has to go every month to Accra to get his pension to pay for his medicine. Every month, he loses time and has to pay for travel expenses. When he arrives in Accra, he has to wait long hours in a line to get the cash. Once he receives his pension he has to be vigilant to not be attacked and have his money stolen. If he lived in a financially inclusive economy, he would have received his pension directly on his phone and been able to go to his local pharmacy to pay for his medicine that same day. Mobile money and financial inclusion would change lives. <em>Estelle Eonnet, director, <a href=\"http://www.micious.org/\">Micious</a>, Paris, France, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%40micious&amp;src=typd\">@micious</a></em></p> <h2><strong>AGAINST<br /></strong></h2> <p><strong>Financial inclusion</strong><strong> is represented enough in the other goals:</strong> Financial services are at their best when they are in service of a larger development issue. The fact that financial inclusion is referenced in nearly all of the existing sustainable development goals (SDGs) demonstrates its central role in the development agenda. If we achieve universal financial access but the rates of poverty, hunger and disease don’t decline in turn, I doubt anyone will feel like celebrating. <em>Robert Meloche, director, Global Financial Inclusion, Visa Inc, San Francisco, California, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robmeloche\">@robmeloche</a></em></p> <p><strong>It supports the other goals:</strong> Surely our goals are poverty eradication, overcoming inequality and sustainable development – financial inclusion is key to achieving all these things. Financing development is a big headache for donors and governments. If we can convince them and the wider development community that not only does financial inclusion enable other goals but that it also potentially contributes to raising domestic resources and reducing aid dependency we are on to a winner. <em>Alice Allan, head of advocacy and policy, <a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/\">Care International UK</a>, London, UK, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aliceallan3\">@aliceallan3</a></em></p> <p><strong>Financial inclusion is not an aim in itself:</strong> Financial inclusion is a means to an end – or many ends – not an end in itself. It should therefore be considered an enabler of a number of the sustainable development goals. Greater financial inclusion contributes to poverty reduction, economic growth and jobs, greater food security and agricultural production, women’s economic empowerment, health protection through managing financial risks associated with prevention and cure. <em>Beth Porter, policy adviser, <a href=\"http://www.uncdf.org/\">UNCDF</a>, New York, USA, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BethPorter19\">@BethPorter19</a></em></p> <h2>Verdict: 5 for, 3 against</h2> <p><em>Read the full Q&amp;A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/nov/07/financial-inclusion-development-enabler-or-goal-in-its-own-right\">here</a>. </em><br /></p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this</strong>:<br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/29/agricultural-insurance-smallholder-farmers-risk-financial-inclusion\">Agriculture insurance: freeing farmers from extreme weather risk</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/24/mobile-money-mhealth-vodafone-pakistan\">Three stories of how digital payments are changing healthcare delivery</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/02/mpesa-safaricom-equity-bank-financial-inclusion-kenya\">Watch out M-Pesa, Equity Bank wants to transform mobile money in Kenya</a><br />• Advertisement feature: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/visa-partner-zone/2014/nov/13/ten-myths-about-m-pesa-2014-update\">Ten myths about M-PESA: 2014 update</a><br /></p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\">Join our community</a> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Some 2.5 billion live without basic sanitation. And more than 3 billion earn less than $2.50 a day, putting them at the bottom of the world’s financial pyramid. 22,000 children living in extreme poverty die every day, according to Unicef.<br /></p> <p>Big businesses have, for years, been making strategic investments to address the needs of these communities. Their motivations range from a public image boost to genuine humanitarian aims. But it’s also simply good economics. “There is a real business reason why we invest in sustainability,” said Hugo van der Goes, vice president of Cargill Cocoa &amp; Chocolate North America. He was among more than 350 speakers from corporate, nonprofit, academic and even artistic sectors who gathered in Minneapolis, Minnesota last week to discuss social change, including some of the latest efforts to reap often elusive profits from social enterprise endeavors. </p> <p>The event, <a href=\"https://netimpact.org/conference\">called the Net Impact Conference</a>, also drew 2,700 estimated attendees, many of them students who consider themselves corporate idealists and are highly motivated to use their business degrees to solve environmental and societal problems.</p> <p>If done right, Van der Goes told them, projects that improve the lives of the poorest of the world’s poor can also spur economic development and increase a firm’s consumer base.</p> <h2>Assisting farmers in Ghana stabilizes a crucial crop </h2> <p>With global demand for cocoa growing even as production stagnates, the cocoa supply has become a major focus of Cargill’s efforts to benefit people at both ends of the pyramid. </p> <p>In Ghana, one of the world’s major cocoa producers, a convergence of social and agricultural factors threatens supply of the crop. Many farms are filled with old trees that are rapidly becoming less productive, making it hard for farmers to earn enough cash to escape poverty. </p> <p>Meanwhile, farmers themselves are aging alongside their trees – but are breaking with a long cultural history of cocoa growing as a family legacy. Instead of passing their farms on to their children, many are encouraging the next generation to move to the city and go to school. </p> <p>In response to this emerging cocoa crisis, <a href=\"http://www.cargillcocoachocolate.com/sustainable-cocoa/the-cargill-cocoa-promise/ \">Cargill is working with local partners</a> to educate farmers on techniques that can help them grow more and higher-quality cocoa, and earn more money for it as well. Measures include enriching poor soils by planting shade trees and adding fertilizers, as well as learning when to cut down old, less productive trees to make room for hardier new trees. (Young cocoa plants can take three or four years to start producing fruit.) </p> <p>Cargill is also building schools, teaching farmers to protect children’s rights, educating communities on nutrition and investing in programs that deliver health care to cocoa-growing regions.</p> <p>Already, these efforts have improved lives while doubling yield in some cases, Van der Goes said. “This is vital, not just for farmers, but for companies like Cargill and our customers,” he said. “We’re going to need every cocoa bean we can grow.”</p> <h2>Safe drinking water funds girls’ education</h2> <p>There is no running water in Kibera, a Nairobi slum where by some estimates more than one million people live in an area smaller than New York’s Central Park, and one child in five does not live to the age of five. The shanty-town’s roads serve as open sewers. Residents hack into the municipal waterline with makeshift hoses that accumulate contamination. Women then line up to purchase the dirty water for their families, paying 10 times more for it than the government charges customers in other parts of the city. </p> <p>Kibera’s tragedy presented an opportunity to Pentair, a global water services provider, according to Amy Skoczias Cole, the firm’s vice president of corporate social responsibility. Speaking at Net Impact, Cole described how in partnership with several nonprofit organizations, <a href=\"http://www.shofco.org/locations/kibera\">the company drilled a well, equipped it with filtration and pumps, and then put kiosks in Kibera</a> to sell the clean water for a nominal fee.</p> <p>Kibera’s women and girls suffer most from the lack of piped-in clean water, Cole said, because they’re the ones who spend all day acquiring and transporting water, and they’re the ones who take care of people who get sick from drinking it. So the profits from the Pentair-provided water kiosks fund Kibera’s first free school for girls.</p> <p>By improving health and access to education in Kibera, Cole said, the firm and its partners hope to cultivate a new generation of community leaders while also contributing to the area’s economic development. Pentair, meanwhile, gets to tap new regions, markets and opportunities.</p> <h2>Building solar-powered service kiosks – and the brand</h2> <p>The Coca-Cola Company is also focusing on providing easy access to clean drinking water, according to Derk Hendriksen, general manager for <a href=\"http://www.coca-colacompany.com/ekocenter/\">the firm’s Ekocenter Project</a>. In some of the poorest neighborhoods in South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Ghana and Vietnam, Coca-Cola is setting up 15ft-long kiosks: modular, solar-powered units that initially will provide water-purification technology, internet connections and power for a wide variety of services, including phone charging, banking, and refrigeration, Hendriksen said. </p> <p>Working with a private German company called Solarkiosk, Coca-Cola plans to have 150 of these Ekocenters up and running in Africa and Southeast Asia by the end of 2015, all operated by local residents – preferably women.<br /></p> <p>From a business standpoint, Hendriksen said, one goal is to improve Coke’s reputation in untapped communities. Another is to put the company’s wares into new hands: eventually the Ekocenters will sell products made by Coca-Cola and other companies.</p> <p>As transformative as all of these projects sound, there remains a vast web of political and logistical hurdles to their success in countries that often lack basic infrastructure, Hendriksen said. Even when local governments are eager and supportive, there are many players involved. Communication can be difficult for both cultural and technological reasons, slowing down the pace of a project.</p> <p> Nevertheless, with their massive supply of resources, mega-companies can have a significant impact on people’s lives. In Coca-Cola’s case, one of the first entrepreneurs chosen to run an Ekocenter in east Africa was a single mother of three young children whose husband had died from HIV/Aids.</p> <p>“It was great to see how she was so committed and enthusiastic and hopeful about the opportunity to run an Ekocenter,” Hendriksen said. “But it was even more compelling to see how her five-year-old son was looking at his mom on the day she opened her store. </p> <p>“I saw the smile and pride on his face as he looked at his mom as a type of role model I don’t think any child in that community had ever seen.”</p> <p><em>Emily Sohn is a freelance journalist in Minneapolis whose stories have appeared in Nature, the Los Angeles Times, Discovery News, Science News and other publications.</em></p> <p>Read more stories like this:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/10/consumers-shopping-solar-ebola-gucci-water-giving-tuesday\">Five products that help the world’s poorest people</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/30/base-of-pyramid-inclusive-business-scale-up-expert-live-chat\">How does the base of the pyramid scale up? – live chat</a></li> <li><strong>Brought to you by Business Call to Action</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/28/time-to-start-challenging-our-assumptions-that-start-ups-cant-reach-scale\">Time to start challenging our assumptions that start-ups can’t reach scale </a><br /></li> </ul> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/role-business-development\">The role of business in development</a> hub is funded by Business Call to Action.

In Rwanda, the grey-crowned crane, which has a striking crown of stiff golden feathers and a bright red spot on its neck and stands at more than a metre high, has become prized as an adornment for private houses and hotels across the country. Despite government bans on the killing, harming or poaching of these birds, many are still being captured and sold to dealers, sometimes for the price of a chicken. “Once they have been taken out of the wild, they can no longer breed and the population drops a little bit more,” says Nsengimana.</p> <p>As a result, there are probably only 300 to 500 grey-crowned cranes left in Rwanda. Yet the bird has a special status in the country as a symbol for two Rwandan clans, and is prized for its beauty.</p> <p>Nsengimana, a survivor of the 1994 Rwanda genocide who spent several months in a refugee camp, decided in 2012 to try to save the crane in his native land. At the time, he was working as a staff veterinary officer for <a href=\"http://gorilladoctors.org/about-mgvp.html\">Gorilla Doctors in Kigali,</a> Rwanda’s capital, but will now devote his time to saving the grey-crowned crane.</p> <p>The first move, Nsengimana says, is to raise public awareness of the bird’s plight and then declare an amnesty for those who still have them in their possession.</p> <p>“We will use these birds to create a captive population of grey-crowned cranes and begin to re-introduce birds at a special rehabilitation centre in Rwanda’s Akagera National Park,” he says.</p> <p>“We hope to get around 40 cranes back into the wild this way in the near future and more later on. The key point about this effort is that Rwandans are going to do this for themselves. This is not going to be a solution imposed from outside the country.</p> <p>“I want this to be something that Rwanda can be proud of and will it for itself.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8c99422cbad06bdee6e1bac563387dad21b82dc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415274877029/51070c98-c411-4734-9153-a224e412ff1b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Thousand Columns Gallery in the central sector of the Imawar Yeuta Cave in the Auyan Tepui.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Thousand Columns Gallery in the central sector of the Imawar Yeuta Cave in the Auyan Tepui.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Romeo/Rolex Awards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>FRANCESCO SAURO: </strong><br /><strong>SEEKING THE ORIGIN OF LIFE </strong></h2> <p>Francesco Sauro has no doubts about the value of exploring the vast cave systems below the table-top tepuis mountains of Brazil and Venezuela. The geologist rates this underground system, which has caverns stretching dozens of kilometres, as the world’s oldest and most important: “You can find minerals that are completely new to science.” And Sauro should know.

This will start with a lengthy reconnoitre to find surface caves that give access to underground cavern systems. “The only way to these caves is by helicopter,” he says. “The tepuis are far too difficult to climb.”</p> <p>Helicopter flights are expensive, hence the great care needed in surveying the tepuis to find the most promising location. Then the real work begins. “The caves are very different from those in Europe,” says Sauro. “You can find great mushroom-shaped and egg-like formations that are the result of interactions between colonies of bacteria and minerals. These are stunning, primitive life-forms and are very important in understanding the origin of life.”</p> <p>Finding such rock formations gives his expedition a real edge, Sauro adds, though the precious nature of his target also poses severe problems: “You have to keep all possible contamination to a minimum. You can only follow careful, restricted paths. The bacterial colonies down there will be very sensitive and we could easily damage them. Of course, you cannot stop breathing. On the other hand, you can do other things, such as bringing back all your faeces and urine in plastic bags. That is a bit messy, especially if you have 20 people working in a cave system for three or four weeks. But that is the nature of this work.”</p> <p>These expeditions are worth such privations, Sauro insists. “Caves are our last dark continent. There are thousands of kilometres to be explored all over the world and they may hold the secrets of the origin of life. For good measure, they are just great places to be inside.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2d6cab0fd588a2cae1284eb41ab6dee3ca6a6ad\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/4/1415107235089/d8c1a547-0d7f-48b1-a445-934d32c0b3e2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Sohum device is tested on a baby at Vaani Vilas Hospital, Bangalore.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sohum device is tested on a baby at Vaani Vilas Hospital, Bangalore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ambroise Tézenas/Rolex Awards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>NEETI KAILAS: </strong><br /><strong>LOW-COST WAY TO DISCOVER IF A CHILD IS DEAF</strong></h2> <p>Deafness can cause cognitive and language impairment if a child’s lack of hearing is not picked up until he or she is five or six years old. By then, it is usually too late for the child to learn to speak properly, with grim effects for their later years. The problem is particularly severe in the developing world, where diagnoses are often difficult and missed. A deaf child is simply assumed to be a slow learner.However, Neeti Kailas has developed Sohum, a cheap, handheld device that can screen a child’s hearing shortly after birth and could be used in remote, rural settings. Those found to have some form of deafness could then be selected for treatment before it is too late to have an effect on their cognitive development.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"596aca698bafeee8ec33d981b37a78323373a6ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/4/1415111844373/dd39f595-9832-4aba-949d-02f94465b936-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Neeti Kailas.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neeti Kailas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ambroise Tézenas/Rolex Awards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“When I was young I knew someone who was deaf and never learned how to speak,” she says. “It was only later that I discovered it is perfectly possible for deaf people to learn to speak if they are spotted early enough. Later I became interested in medical devices and it seemed logical to follow this interest through.”</p> <p>Kailas, 28, has set up Sohum Innovation Lab in Chennai, India, with her husband Nitin Sisodia, an electrical engineer. The outcome is the Sohum. (The term comes from Vedic philosophy and connects a person with the fabric of the universe.)</p> <p>To use a Sohum scanner, three electrodes are placed via a headband on to a child’s skull. These measure the electrical response his or her brain’s auditory system makes to a specific noise, which appear as five peaks on the device. If these show up, the child can hear. Crucially, the device contains filters that remove ambient noise so that it can be used in noisy settings such as villages, halls or busy surgeries.</p> <p>Kailas is working on preparing the first batch of Sohum devices that will act as a proof-of-concept for the system. When in full production it is hoped they will sell for around $1,500 (£930), considerably lower than $5,000-$25,000 for current devices. Once enough are in operation, a Sohumwould cost around $2.40. If combined as part of government vaccination schemes, costs could be reduced to a few cents. As Neeti says: “We have great hopes for Sohum.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a150a024b6ac50c7ffbbf0b821357de76c50fc1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/4/1415107438941/319f3d6b-b94b-4050-a02c-5ec4b1b41e7b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hosam Zowawi loads up superbugs for examination.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hosam Zowawi loads up superbugs for examination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Kingma/Rolex Awards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>HOSAM ZOWAWI: </strong><br /><strong>BATTLING THE MICROBE SUPERBUGS</strong></h2> <p>Hosam Zowawi’s father is a bee-keeper, which impacted on his son’s professional life. “One day, when I was about seven, a relative brought my father a microscope to study honey and pollen particles.

Now he is turning that expertise into an enterprise aimed at having a direct impact on healthcare.</p> <p>His particular concern is antibiotic resistance, a problem that has reached a critical status in many parts of the globe. Over-prescribing of antibiotics means some strains of microbes have evolved an ability to withstand the effects of these drugs. Life-threatening infections, once controlled by medicines, are now spreading unhindered between patients.</p> <p>One solution, says Hosam, is to find ways to diagnose, quickly and efficiently, which strain a patient is carrying. If they are found to have a resistant strain, a non-resistant antibiotic can be administered. The critical point is that this should be done when a patient is first diagnosed with an infection. Present tests require up to 48 hours to determine if a bug is resistant to an antibiotic, giving it time to spread through the body.</p> <p>The problem has led Hosam to develop two tests that both aim to cut detection times of resistant strains to a few hours. The first is called the Rapid Superbug test, which can pinpoint the presence of genes that code for beta-lactamase enzymes, chemicals that allow bacteria to destroy important classes of antibiotics, including penicillin. The second test rapidly identifies a class of bacteria called gram-negative bacilli, which are more likely to be antibiotic resistant than gram-positive strains, the other main group of bacteria.</p> <p>Hosam’s plans include an antibiotics awareness campaign for the Gulf region that will include videos, flyers and social media. His overall budget – for tests and awareness campaign – is $86,000, to which his Rolex award will make a substantial contribution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00404d8ddb2c01fad4b36abd6488f8254f696848\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/4/1415107636522/21e2398e-6548-4717-be5e-41a58dc73403-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A patient's heart is monitored using the Cardiopad.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A patient’s heart is monitored using the Cardiopad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Latzel/Rolex Awards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>ARTHUR ZANG: </strong><br /><strong>INVENTOR OF CARDIOPAD COMPUTER</strong></h2> <p>Arthur Zang has a straightforward claim to fame: he is responsible for developing Africa’s first medical tablet computer, the Cardiopad. The device allows a nurse in a remote rural clinic to record a patient’s electrocardiograph (EEC) – an electric signal that reveals crucial information about the behaviour of a person’s heart – and transmit it wirelessly to a cardiologist in a city hospital who will then decide whether or not the patient needs treatment or drugs, or if are they are healthy enough to continue without medical intervention?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ec29ac7718da9b5880252e76453eff61940173d9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/4/1415112012464/815d36dd-5b28-4228-bc40-b72a4e552e86-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Arthur Zang.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arthur Zang.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ambroise Tézenas/Rolex Awards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I am from Cameroon and we have fewer than 50 cardiologists in this country,” says the 27-year-old computer engineer. “Yet more than 22 million people live here. We need to find a way to make the most use of their expertise and to pinpoint people at risk of heart disease without having them travel unnecessarily through remote countryside to get to a city. That is why I developed the Cardiopad.”</p> <p>The device is intriguing in its own right but there is an added twist to the story of its creation. Zang’s mother, Felicite, is a nurse and immediately saw the value of the Cardiopad. As Zang struggled to raise funds to make a prototype device, she took out a $1,500 bank loan to help his work. “She believed in the Cardiopad from the beginning,” Zang says.</p> <p>That money allowed him to make a prototype device that, in turn, interested the Cameroon government which invested $37,000 in the project. “With that money I went to China and met entrepreneurs. They helped me manufacture 30 complete devices. We are now using these to promote the product and to test them.”</p> <p>Currently the Cardiopad is being used in two hospitals in Cameroon, one in the village of Mbankomo and the other, 20km away, in Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon. “The nurse attaches electrodes to a patient’s chest and it reads their EEC which is then transmitted to the Cardiopad of the cardiologist in Yaoundé from which a diagnosis is made,” says Zang. “The results have been very good.”</p> <p>And now with his Rolex prize money, Arthur has been able to set up plans for full-scale production of Cardiopads. “We will be selling many devices very soon,” adds Zang. “Then I can pay my mother back.”</p> <h2>EVERY SECOND COUNTS: JOIN OUR FORUM</h2> <p>The Observer and the Guardian are launching a half-day forum, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/sep/30/-sp-tim-berners-lee-second-counts-forum\" title=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/sep/30/-sp-tim-berners-lee-second-counts-forum\">Every Second Counts</a>, at Kings Place, London, on Saturday 15 November.

London has introduced both bike-sharing and bike lanes, and Paris even has a bike-sharing programme for children. In Copenhagen, ever the bicycle champion, <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenize.com/2014/07/the-greatest-urban-experiment-right-now.html\">41% of rides to work and education now take place on bicycle seats</a>. But what if you’re not super fit, don’t want to arrive at work sweaty, or if you simply live far from your job? A new hybrid “e-bike” promises to fix that dilemma.</p> <p>To be precise, the <a href=\"https://www.superpedestrian.com/\">Copenhagen Wheel</a> is not truly an e-bike at all. It’s a wheel that can be attached to a regular bike. That wheel, equipped with a motor, batteries, sensors and wireless connectivity, transforms the bike into a smart bike that multiplies pedal power and even measures the rider’s heart rate and monitors potholes. “The experience is very natural,” claims Assaf Biderman, associate director of <a href=\"http://senseable.mit.edu/\">MIT’s SENSEable City Lab</a>, which developed the Copenhagen Wheel, and CEO of Superpedestrian, the startup that makes the wheel. “You can essentially ride as far as you like.” </p> <p>The MIT team came up with the idea behind the Copenhagen Wheel not because they were looking to improve bikes but because they were trying to solve an urgent problem: traffic in the world’s fast-growing cities. “The car is not going to go away,” explains Biderman. “We realised that the bike is the best solution if we allow it to become more like a car.” Indeed, the MIT team worked with a range of cities in developing solutions for urban infrastructure, but decided that this concept – developed in conjunction with Copenhagen city planners – had the most obvious consumer-market potential.</p> <p>The Copenhagen Wheel, which can be pre-ordered online and will go on the market later this year, adds a smart twist to the traditional e-bike: power assist; brakes that store energy; and algorithms that help the bike understand when the rider pedals harder, allowing the wheel to push with more power.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Copenhagen Wheel\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/S10GMfG2NMY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>New York-based company FlyKly makes a similar wheel, the <a href=\"http://www.flykly.com/smart-wheel\">Smart Wheel</a>, available for pre-order since October. “The smart thing is the most interesting aspect about these bikes,” says Esben Alslund-Lanthén, a research analyst at Danish sustainability think tank Sustainia. “Copenhagen isn’t hilly, but it’s windy. The smart aspect makes biking much more convenient. And cyclists in hilly cities like San Francisco can really benefit from it.”</p> <p>Granted, when the traditional e-bike was developed, such bells and whistles were simply not possible. Digital technology, Biderman says, has come to the aid of urban transportation: “Thanks to digital devices, there’s a feedback loop between us and the environment around us. We asked ourselves: “how can we use that feedback loop to help improve the urban environment?’”</p> <p>SENSEable City Lab’s answer is to use the same sensors that measure the rider’s activity to also survey the environment around them. If used on a large scale, and assuming riders give their consent, such data showing both urban traffic activity and road passages in need of repair can be collected and evaluated by city planners. The humble bike, in other words, stands to become an important piece of urban infrastructure. </p> <p>That, Biderman says, makes the Copenhagen Wheel especially useful for cities such as Lagos, Nigeria, or Nairobi, Kenya, that until now haven’t closely monitored their traffic patterns. He predicts the Copenhagen Wheel could become the transportation equivalent of the mobile phone in developing countries: “They leapfrogged the west in going straight to mobile phones, skipping landlines altogether. The same thing could happen in urban mobility, with people opting for the Copenhagen Wheel rather than taking the traditional first step of buying a car.”</p> <p>Smart bikes may, if widely adopted, also change the way we think about urban transportation, turning it from a utilitarian process that’s often a waste of time into an activity with wellness potential – without the sweaty office arrival. In Copenhagen, Alslund-Lanthén notes, city agencies already use e-bikes as a way of getting staff around the city faster while helping them get healthier.</p> <p>There’s only one thing: where to park the wheel? The Copenhagen Wheel and FlyKly’s Smart Wheel aren’t cheap, at $799 and $800 (£505), respectively. Although they can be locked electronically, Alslund-Lanthén also advises “locking it to something really solid”.</p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/16/banning-dangerous-chemicals-business\">Why banning dangerous chemicals is not enough</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/24/green-chemistry-save-toxification-chemicals-business\">Will green chemistry save us from toxification?</a></li> <li>Brought to you by: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/04/conference-technology-minimise-carbon-footprint\">Cutting emissions and saving money through teleconferencing</a></li> </ul> <p><em>The </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/technology-innovation\"><em>technology and innovation hub</em></a><em> is funded by BT.

Using traditional farming techniques, their tiny businesses <a href=\"http://makechocolatefair.org/issues/cocoa-prices-and-income-farmers-0\">trap them in a life of poverty</a>, with most unable to earn enough to make a sustainable living for themselves and their families. Meanwhile, some of world’s wealthiest confectionery companies make huge profits on the back of insufficient wages. <br /></p> <p>Mars is one such organisation. Tracking its supply chain back to 150,000 of these impoverished growers, it decided it had a responsibility to share the benefits of its global success with all those involved in the business.<br /></p> <p>The company invested in new technology for the farmers which has revolutionised their way of life. The average cocoa yield has tripled - and average incomes along with it. It also means Mars has access to more cocoa.<br /></p> <p>This pilot project is just one part of a five-year research project between Mars and the University of Oxford’s Said Business School, exploring the concept of mutuality in business. By working with the food and drinks giant, academics at the university are analysing if there are other, more flexible ways of being a mutual organisation without directly sharing ownership – something Mars has no interest in doing.</p> <p>Founded in 1947, Mars was created on the principle that “the company can only be successful if everyone else around it is successful,” says chief sustainability officer, Barry Parkin. In founding the research partnership with Oxford, Parkin says that Mars wants to establish how, as a modern multinational, it can spread value and profits through stakeholders and supply chain.</p> <p>A second pilot project in Kenya is looking at how people from the poorest communities in Nairobi can be brought into the distribution and supply chain of the confectioner. This, says Mars is so Kenyans can access employment and be taught how to be more entrepreneurial. Young Kenyans benefit as they are able to draw an income as a local distributor, while Mars benefits because their products are marketed and distributed to new communities.<br /></p> <p>Mars feels the first efforts have been a success. “We’re now looking to scale that into other countries,” Parkin says.<br /></p> <p>Colin Mayer, professor of management studies at the Said Business School, says a strong interest in the changing shape of business leadership led to the partnership.<br /></p> <p>“One of the things we’re particularly interested in is how mutuality can be introduced into different types of businesses… the extent to which companies that do not have a formal mutual structure may be able to be [mutual to some extent]... we’re interested in the notion that the benefits of a company should not just be benefits that accrue to the shareholders.”<br /></p> <p>Oxford’s researchers will challenge Mars to think about being a mutual business in the broadest sense. It will look at sharing the benefits of the business with suppliers, customers, communities, future generations - and even the planet as a producer.<br /></p> <p>The scheme will give Oxford’s business school a large body of research work to draw on as it develops its programmes for students focused on responsible leadership. Mars also hopes that it will mark the business out as a thought-leader on the issue of sharing the benefits of business.<br /></p> <p>“People talk a great deal about these ideas. What’s really required in this area is for there to be some role models,” says Mayer.<br /></p> <p>For those involved in creating genuinely mutual, co-owned organisations the move may appear a little more cynical. Though it makes efforts to spread the spoils of business, the model is not a profit-share.<br /></p> <p>Nevertheless, campaigners say that the risk of the term ‘mutual’ being hijacked is far outweighed by the benefits of such a large profit-making organisation talking openly about new ways of doing business.<br /></p> <p>Gareth Swarbrick, who set up the largest social housing mutual in the UK - Rochdale Boroughwide Housing - says he will be following the research closely.<br /></p> <p>“Mars have quite an interesting history, they’re not your typical plc,” he says. “If, through this piece of work, they decide to incorporate some of their values of mutuality in to the way they organise themselves and the way they involve people, that could send a strong message out because of the scale”.<br /></p> <p>Swarbrick says that if the research looked at how the values, ethics and economics of mutuality could be applied to other sectors it would be beneficial to all - with organisations like his own able to act as gatekeepers for mutuality. He hopes it would show that companies “can have scale without conforming”.<br /></p> <p>“Yes there is a risk, but it’s worth trying,” he added. “There is a need for a bit more plurality and a few different models rather than everyone being wedded to the plc model.”<br /></p> <p>Iain Hasdell, chief executive of the Employee Ownership Association, says he will be looking for a combination of concepts of employee ownership and employee engagement in the Mars project. “It is the combination of the two that creates the higher productivity and profitability that characterise employee-owned businesses,” he says.<br /></p> <p>Ultimately, Oxford’s academics will use the partnership to understand the effects of changing the way a large organisation does business. Mayer says he will assess the impact of Mars’ version of mutuality on social capital and human capital in and around the business.<br /></p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/20/credit-unions-edging-alternative-banks-payday-loans\">Credit unions are increasingly an alternative for banks and payday loans</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/23/lessons-for-co-operatives-on-ensuring-a-fair-and-democratic-structure\">Lessons for co-operatives on ensuring a fair and democratic structure</a></li> </ul> <p><em>The </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/co-operatives-and-mutuals\"><em>co-operatives and mutuals hub</em></a><em> is funded by The Co-operative.

In the seven years since BASF launched an initiative of the same name, Samruddhi has also meant a new way of life for hundreds of thousands of soybean farmers across India. </p> <p>In 2007, the multinational company established a pilot project with 30,000 soybean farmers to help them boost productivity in their crops and incomes in the marketplace. </p> <p>“The single biggest need gap we found was in information,” said Raman Ramachandran, chairman of BASF Companies in India, during the recent Business Call to Action Forum 2014. “How to you grow soy better and make it more economical?”</p> <p>The answer, it turns out, rested with providing farmers tips on how and when to fertilise and safely utilise pesticides. BASF hosted town hall sessions for farmers, conducted field trials and worked directly with farmers during harvest season and when it came time to sell their products at market. </p> <p>BASF is one of nearly 100 members of the Business Call to Action, which was established in 2008 to accelerate progress toward the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</a> by challenging companies to develop inclusive business models that cater to people in emerging markets earning less than $8 (£5) per day. </p> <p>By 2013, more than 221,000 farmers had joined in BASF’s program, Ramachandran reported. He pointed to a PricewaterhouseCoopers impact assessment of Samruddhi, which found that participating farmers have increased yields by 25% and incomes by 36%. This assessment also determined that a large portion of the farmers reinvest their earnings in food, medicine and education for their families. The initiative not only benefits the farmers, but also BASF since farmers who have profited are buying more farm equipment like tractors and inputs like seeds, as well as fertilisers from BASF. </p> <p>When asked if BASF would invest in this project as a business initiative – and not a break-even or potentially expensive corporate social responsibility project – Ramachandran’s answer was unequivocal. </p> <p>“Definitely,” he said. “We knew that if (participating farmers) developed better practices, many of our inputs would work.”</p> <p><strong>Watch: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q55ASTGDKqk&amp;list=UUayG4lIz84kodibJ1dZAq3w\" rel=\"nofollow\">video interview with BASF’s </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q55ASTGDKqk&amp;list=UUayG4lIz84kodibJ1dZAq3w\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Raman Ramachjandran</strong></a></p> <p>Samruddhi is a relatively well-established project, but other companies are just starting to find their footing in terms of harnessing their products for customers at the base of the pyramid. For example, Panasonic, which is best known for its consumer electronics products, is making a major transition as it sees profits from products like TVs decline. Part of its turnaround plan relies heavily upon earnings from its automotive and industrial systems units. </p> <p>At the same time, Panasonic is looking for business and sustainability impact wherever it can reasonably extend itself. That includes base of the pyramid customers. The company is selling a new <a href=\"http://news.panasonic.net/stories/2013/0513_22556.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">solar lantern</a>, which it says can illuminate for up to 90 hours thanks to a 3.5W solar panel. The system, which also includes a USB port for cell phone charging, is available in Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kenya and Malaysia.</p> <p>This is new territory for the electronics giant, which estimates that 30,000 tons of carbon emissions could be cut through the sale of 1m lanterns over five years. The problem doesn’t seem to be the technology, but rather the challenge of selling it.</p> <p>“We do not have the sales channels required to deliver solar lanterns to the base of the pyramid,” said Genichiro Shimada, general manager for Panasonic’s International Relations Group, during the Business Call to Action forum. “We need to create new sales channels with inclusive business partners.”</p> <p>So far, many of those channels have included selling to donor organisations. Shimada says the firm is working hard to build relationships with NGOs, microcredit firms and loosely affiliated sales networks in order to get its product into the hands of those who really need it. (Forging those relationships is one of the goals of the Business Call to Action and the forum.) </p> <p>“Competition is needed in the market,” Shimada said. “We can compete [with established social enterprises]; we want to create a better quality product than them. And that’s good for the market.”</p> <p><strong>Watch: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGvBm_skfvk&amp;list=UUayG4lIz84kodibJ1dZAq3w\" rel=\"nofollow\">video interview with Panasonic’s </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGvBm_skfvk&amp;list=UUayG4lIz84kodibJ1dZAq3w\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Genichiro Shimada</strong></a></p> <p>For some companies at the forum, the social mission has migrated from the back burner to front and centre of their business operations. DataWind Ltd., which makes a $35 (£22) tablet for low-income markets, is one such company. CEO Suneet Singh Tuli said that DataWind is competing “neck and neck in India” with Samsung for low-income customers. </p> <p>Tuli said that DataWind determined the price point for the tablet because it represents roughly a week’s salary for low-income Indians, proportionately the same as a tablet costs a typical worker in a developed economy. </p> <p>“The 4.5 billion people worldwide without internet will evaporate in three to five years,” he stated. “We hope to create price pressure on hardware, but also start new business models.” </p> <p>One such business model is delivering faster processing speeds despite the fact that most customers in India are only able to access slower 2G networks. DataWind also plans to field web-based ads, using that revenue to offset the cost of providing internet services to its devices.</p> <p><strong>Watch: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4dTVLc-KBc&amp;list=UUayG4lIz84kodibJ1dZAq3w\" rel=\"nofollow\">video interview with DataWind’s </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4dTVLc-KBc&amp;list=UUayG4lIz84kodibJ1dZAq3w\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Suneet Singh Tuli</strong></a></p> <p>Disruption of business models, especially those that contribute to cycles of poverty, was another theme at the forum. Bart Hartman, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.nots.nl/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">NOTS Impact Enterprises</a>, aims to completely overhaul the process of charcoal production, which is dirty, time consuming and adds to deforestation across sub-Saharan Africa. </p> <p>Click <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/94190166\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> to see a video on the process. </p> <p>Hartman explained that the company’s solution, which involves a low-cost and highly efficient oven – as well as planting trees to offset those lost in the production of coal – has been tested and proven to reduce carbon emissions by 75% while reducing charcoal production to a three day process instead of the typical 11 day cycle. It could also shift the balance of power in the business relationship of charcoal production.</p> <p>“Traders currently earn a disproportionately greater share than producers … what we want to do is to help charcoal producers get a larger stake,” Hartman said. </p> <p><strong>Watch: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFgu66BCnGY&amp;list=UUayG4lIz84kodibJ1dZAq3w\" rel=\"nofollow\">video interview with NOTS’ Bart Hartman</a> <br /></strong></p> <p>Some 75% of production and consumption of charcoal is happening in 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of people use charcoal for cooking. Hartman stated that with proper investment (which he estimated at €100m (£78.3m)), charcoal production will be sustainable by 2025. </p> <p>As the MDGs are nearing their deadline in 2015, the United Nations is crafting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to take their place. Those 17 goals, still in draft form, include over 100 targets and will focus on improvements in health, sanitation and education. Every single one will be relevant for businesses – both environmentally and economically.</p> <p>While there is a lot to criticise about the MDGs, they did move companies, NGOs and governments toward new alliances, even if those alliances were beta versions when it comes to actual impact. The SDGs by design have engaged more companies in their formulation, according to Paul Ladd, senior policy advisor and lead author, post-2015 and SDGs at the United Nations Development Programme.</p> <p>Stuart Hart, who led the panel that included both Shimada and Hartman, posed the question: in 15 years, will those companies that fail to integrate the SDGs into their core business operations be at a competitive disadvantage? Hart, the Grossman Endowed Chair in Sustainable Business at the University of Vermont Business School and the S.C. Johnson Chair emeritus at Cornell University, clearly thought so, as did other members of the panel. As evidenced by statements earlier in the week from the Rockefeller family <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/22/rockefeller-heirs-divest-fossil-fuels-climate-change\">divesting</a> its dirty energy assets, it’s hard not to agree.</p> <p>But Ladd was more circumspect. “It would be great if everyone came to the table out of a social obligation”, he said. But despite the “backslapping” around alliances and triple bottom lines, some companies “unfortunately will do just fine working in a less than sustainable way” – ie business as usual. That is why we need more pressure from civil society and the streets, in which just days earlier in New York City some 400,000 people demonstrated for real action on climate change by the United Nations General Assembly.</p> <p>Ladd seemed to share the protesters’ sense of urgency. “We’re running out of time,” he said.</p> <p><em>Access the event summary report <a href=\"http://www.businesscalltoaction.org/resources/publications/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> with links to event videos and other resources. </em> </p> <p><em>Scott Anderson is the managing editor of <a href=\"http://nextbillion.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">NextBillion.net</a>, a website and blog bringing together the community of business leaders, social entrepreneurs, NGOs, policy makers and academics who want to explore the connection between development and enterprise.</em></p> <p><strong>More from the Business Call to Action partner zone:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/28/time-to-start-challenging-our-assumptions-that-start-ups-cant-reach-scale\">Time to start challenging our assumptions that start-ups can’t reach scale</a> </li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/20/bcta-datawind-tablet-pc-developing\">Low-cost tablet PC looks to aid education in poor communities</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/22/empowering-farmers-through-mobile-communication-in-west-africa\">Empowering farmers through mobile communication in west Africa </a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Content on this page is paid for and provided by <a href=\"http://www.businesscalltoaction.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Business Call to Action</a>, supporter of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/role-business-development\">the role of business in development hub</a></strong></p> <p><em>Launched at the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Nations</a>, <a href=\"http://www.businesscalltoaction.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Business Call to Action</a> (BCtA) is a global alliance hosted by the <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Nations Development Programme</a> headquarters in New York.

Yet it is becoming increasingly apparent that digital payments in rural, remote areas settings are quicker, easier, and safer. The likelihood of fraud drops as fewer hands are needed to transfer the money. And the transaction costs decline, making it cheaper for providers to reach rural populations. This translates into scale - a sought after goal in most public health projects - enabling organisations to cover larger areas with their services.</p> <p>A digital trail also allows for easy data collection, auditing, and transparency, all of which is essential in health programming. Ultimately, USAid suggests programmes could create sustainable business models, becoming less dependant on donor funding and build relationships with new corporate partners. But what is the evidence?</p> <p>Here are three projects that illustrate how technology, and more specifically, mobile money, can improve the reach and result of healthcare initiatives.</p> <h2>Helping fistula patients access transport costs</h2> <p>Obstetric fistula is a disabling condition that leaves women incontinent as a result of prolonged or obstructed labour. Despite corrective surgery being relatively cheap and easy to perform, hospital wards that could carry out the operation in Tanzania were largely empty.<br /></p> <p>“Transport is a very big barrier for these women,” says Erwin Telemans, chief executive of Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation hospital in Tanzania (CCBRT). With a choice between a two to three day trek or transportation costs varying between $15 and $60, many women decide instead to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/23/fistula-women-ethiopia\">endure the pain and stigma</a>.</p> <p>Looking for a solution to their empty beds, CCBRT <a href=\"http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/about/foundation/mobiles_for_good/ccbrt.html\">partnered with Vodafone Foundation</a> to pay for the transport costs of these fistula patients. Using its network of 600 community workers who operate at village-level, the clinic transfers funds via mobile to a local community worker who then buys a ticket for the patient. Last year, 70% of the <a href=\"http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/about/foundation/mobiles_for_good/ccbrt.html\">women treated for fistula at the hospital</a> came through this mobile money scheme and the model is scalable. The clinic is now expanding the project to support children with cleft lip, using a similar M-Pesa scheme.</p> <h2>Encouraging better financial management for pregnant women</h2> <p>In Zanzibar, non-profit <a href=\"http://www.d-tree.org/\">D-tree</a> has partnered with mobile network Zantel to employ a similar strategy: paying for transport costs via mobile money to ensure that women give birth in clinics, not at home.<br /></p> <p>Since 2011, over 10,000 births were administered under the programme, with 30,000 mobile money transactions helping to enable the wider goal, pushing the percentage of pregnancies in clinics from 48% to 78%, according to Marc Mitchell, founder of D-tree.<br /></p> <p>For the programme to survive though, there has to be continued buy-in from all the participating bodies. To encourage better financial planning and to create an incentive for telecom companies to participate, D-tree is developing mobile wallets for pregnant women.</p> <p>Mitchell says that the mobile wallet will shift some of the responsibility back onto the patient, helping mums-to-be contribute to the cost of their maternal care and teaching them some money management skills; encouraging them to save small amounts across the nine months of their pregnancy.</p> <h2>Facilitating health insurance payments</h2> <p>In Pakistan, Dr Asher Hasan is shifting the cost of healthcare from NGOs and the private sector to employers. Pakistan’s public healthcare system has serious gaps. Medicines, x-rays and tests cost extra, meaning that paying for a health emergency is still a challenge for many in the country. His Karachi-based social enterprise, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nayajeevan\">Naya Jeevan</a>, allows employers to sign workers up for health insurance for $2 per person per month.</p> <p>While a string of mutlinationals including Unilever have signed up, Hasan says uptake is not happening as quickly as he wished.The problem was the sign-up process was too time-consuming, requiring detailed information about employees. Naya Jeevan now gathers that information directly from the employees, and Hasan is looking to streamline the process further using digital payments.</p> <p>In 2013, 400 of nearly 900 insured households in Sultanabad, Karachi, were enrolled with United Bank Limited’s mobile banking platform, <a href=\"http://www.ubldirect.com/Corporate/BankingServices/Omni/home.aspx\">Omni</a> as a 12-month pilot. These households were asked to make all their payments for clinical services digitally. The process coincedentally introduced more people to mobile banking for the first time and attached it to an important concern - their health.</p> <p>Hasan now wants digital health and financial services to be further integrated. Naya Jeevan is now enrolling patients on a smart-card system, using a mobile banking platform, and transitioning to digital prescriptions, so medicines can be paid for with mobile money.</p> <h2><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong><br /></h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/02/mpesa-safaricom-equity-bank-financial-inclusion-kenya\">Watch out M-Pesa, Equity Bank wants to transform mobile money in Kenya</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/18/mobile-payment-utilitlies-east-africa\">Using mobile money to buy water and solar power in east Africa</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/blog/2014/aug/18/econet-wireless-zimbabwe-cashless-society\">Zimbabwe’s Econet Wireless and the making of Africa’s first cashless society</a></p> <p>• Advertisement feature: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/visa-partner-zone/10-things-you-need-to-know-mobile-money\">10 things you need to know about mobile money </a></p> <p><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\"><strong>Join our community</strong></a><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

He's been reverse engineering Snapchat's API to demonstrate exactly the problem of rogue third party apps for years. \"Your average developer can build something in a day's time that interacts with Snapchat's API and saves everything that comes through it,\" Caudill says. \"Quite honestly, I'm surprised this hasn't happened sooner.\"</p><p>Caudill first warned Snapchat in 2012 that he had analyzed its API and could build a pirate app that stripped out its time-deletion features. \"Given the nature of the application, I suspect unofficial clients are unavoidable…especially as the service grows in popularity,\" he wrote at the time.</p></blockquote><p>How do you prevent, in perpetuity, a third-party app with the correct login details from accessing your server?</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/8/6919179/stop-supporting-gamergate\">Stop supporting Gamergate &gt;&gt; The Verge</a></h2><p>T.C.Sottek: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/10/in-defense-of-gamers/\">as Peter Frase wrote in Jacobin</a>, there's a reactionary right-wing flavour to all of Gamergate's desperate yelling. (Liz Ryerson was the first to thoroughly document this extremism.) \"Some gamers would like it both ways: they want everyone to take their medium seriously, but they don't want anyone to challenge their political assumptions or call into question the way gamers treat people who don't look and think like them,\" Frase wrote. \"They hate and fear a world where games are truly made by and for everyone.\"</p><p>What gives Gamergate power and momentum is its extremist conservative obstinacy; it is a reactionary movement against progressive voices that hoodwinks typically apolitical game players by convincing them of some harm that doesn't actually exist, like they are losing their right to free speech, or their hobby is being killed by an anti-gamer conspiracy. Once you've insinuated something like that, whether or not it's true, it's easy to get a lot of people on your side; a closely related project is to get people hyped up about people stealing votes to justify racially and politically biased ID laws, even though voter fraud in the United States is a mythical boogeyman.</p></blockquote><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/10/7/6936361/the-amazing-progress-of-leds-in-one-chart\">The amazing progress of LEDs, in one chart &gt;&gt; Vox</a></h2><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Everyone knows about Moore's law, which says that the number of transistors in a computer chip (and, therefore, its computing power) doubles every 18 to 24 months.

It says that every 10 years, the power of LED lighting packages will increase by a factor of 20, while the cost of these packages, per unit of illumination, will fall by a factor of 10.</p><p>The law is named after Roland Haitz, who made the forecast in 2000. And so far, the industry has actually exceeded his expectations…</p><p>Recently progress has accelerated, so that you can now get LED packages that produce 1,000 lumens of light. If current trends continue you'll be able to buy 10,000-lumen LED lights in a few years.</p><p>For comparison, a 100-watt incandescent light bulb produces around 1,700 lumens.

As of a year ago, less than 10% of Google Play visitors paid for anything, according to a person who had access to the figure.</p><p>Over the past year or so, Google has reduced the cut of Google Play revenue it gives to some partners that sell Android devices from 25% to 15% and, in at least one case, to zero. It told at least one partner that the reduction came because Google wasn't generating enough money from Google Play.</p><p>Google Play has been held back for other reasons. Android devices, with few exceptions, are viewed by consumers as more down-market than the iPhone. As a consequence, wealthier phone buyers pick the iPhone over Android, and those people end up spending more money through apps and on buying digital content than the owners of Android devices. Google has been working on ways to help change that perception, but it will be an uphill battle.</p></blockquote><p>Less than 10% of people have paid for something on Google Play; yet Google is slicing away at the cut it gives to OEMs (and carriers).

It’s a game, obviously: one that its developer Mojang has sold nearly 54m copies of across computers, consoles and mobile devices so far.</p> <p>It’s a series of books published by Egmont that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/26/minecraft-david-walliams-youtube-childrens-books\">sold more than 1.3m copies in the UK alone</a> in the first eight months of 2014. It’s a <a href=\"http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Minecraft-ByTheme\">range of Lego kits</a> that have been selling out rapidly, as well as the source for a line of plush toys, hoodies and other products <a href=\"https://minecraft.net/store\">sold from Mojang’s online store</a>.</p> <p>But Minecraft is also an educational tool in schools through the <a href=\"http://minecraftedu.com/\">MinecraftEdu</a> initiative, and the driver for <a href=\"http://blockbyblock.org/\">Block by Block</a>, a partnership with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme to get young people involved in planning public urban spaces, starting with a pilot in Kenya.</p> <p>Minecraft is also one of YouTube’s most popular video categories – right up there with music – fuelling hugely popular channels like Stampy (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/01/youtube-pewdiepie-august-disneycollector-katy-perry\">the fourth biggest YouTube channel in the world</a> in August with 217.9m views) and The Diamond Minecart (sixth with 190.6m views).<br /></p> <p>Oh, and at some point in the next 3-4 years, Minecraft will also be a movie, courtesy of a <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/minecraft-movie-in-the-works-at-warner-bros/\">deal between Mojang and Hollywood studio Warner Brothers</a>.</p> <p>It’s unsurprisingly one of the key topics for nosy questions when The Guardian interviews Mojang’s chief operating officer Vu Bui, ahead of his keynote speech this week at London’s Brand Licensing Europe conference.</p> <p>A Minecraft film? When’s it coming out? “I still have no idea. A long time. I’m going to guess three years, but it could be four, probably not two. 3-4 years seems to be a reasonable bet,” says Bui, stressing that the project remains in its early days of development.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbae06361c8297f6381f29eec3db5828622b5263\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412774909418/de99ca59-7873-469e-9aa3-600f342a3d01-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mojang's chief operating officer Vu Bui.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mojang’s chief operating officer Vu Bui.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lydia Winters/Mojang</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February, news site <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2014/02/minecraft-movie-warner-bros-lego-movie-producer-690664/\">Deadline provided initial details</a>, suggesting that the Minecraft movie would be live-action, and produced by Roy Lee and Jill Messick – Lee having previously produced The Lego Movie, which should bode well.</p> <p>“We were approached by so many studios, but after talking to Warner Bros, we decided that this are absolutely the team we want to work with,” says Bui. “They respect the brand, respect the IP, and want to make something that is going to be awesome, not just capitalise on the success of the game.”</p> <p>Is it really live-action? Who’s in it? Bui chuckles as he parries the question. “A movie takes years, especially a large-budget movie like this. It’s still in the beginning stages, and there really isn’t a clear picture yet of what this is going to be. Once there is, I’m sure we’ll share more.”</p> <p>He’s very clear on one point though: whatever story the Minecraft movie tells, it will just be one story among many possible, matching the way there is no single ‘right’ way to play Minecraft as a game.</p> <p>“We don’t want any story that we make, whether it’s a movie or a book, to create some sort of ‘this is the official Minecraft, this is how you play the game’ thing. That would discourage all the players who don’t play in that way,” says Bui. “When coming up with a story, we want to make sure it is just a story within Minecraft, as opposed to <em>the</em> story within Minecraft.”</p> <p>There are plenty of other things to talk about when it comes to the business around Minecraft, which Bui says is still overseen by a tiny core team within Mojang – mainly art director Markus ‘Junkboy’ Toivonen and director of fun Lydia Winters. Yes, that is her job title.</p> <p>“Every product that exists out there officially, they have gone over pixel-by-pixel, and for the books, page-by-page. We keep all our approvals in-house – we don’t use any licensing agents – and we are very hardcore about those approvals, to make sure each product is something we believe in,” says Bui.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"110cc38832680d750ea82a0c076c3c10f94a1bc5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412775146674/d0be7707-0616-431d-82a0-da030f80465a-396x420.png\" alt=\"The next Minecraft book, Blockopedia, is hexagonal.\" width=\"396\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The next Minecraft book, Blockopedia, is hexagonal.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this year, Angry Birds maker Rovio revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/28/angry-birds-rovio-financial-results-2013\">47% of its income in 2013 came from its consumer products division</a>. Minecraft products may be selling well, but for Mojang, the emphasis in its business is still firmly tilted in favour of gaming.</p> <p>“Licensing is a small portion of our business, and we want to keep it that way. We’re a games studio, and I don’t think that’s going to change any time soon,” says Bui.</p> <p>“But people do want to have something physical in their life when they’re not in front of a screen. When we make merchandise, we’re thinking about making something for the people who want it and love it, not just as a source of revenues.”</p> <p>Mojang’s partnership with Egmont has been positive for both companies, but particularly the latter – and the wider children’s books market.<br /></p> <p>In an appearance at a conference in July, the publisher’s international CEO Rob McMenemy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/03/will-digital-eat-the-childrens-media-world-its-totally-going-to-happen\">told the audience</a> that in the UK “the children’s book market year-on-year grew by 11%” in 2013. When asked why, he gave a one-word answer: “Minecraft”.</p> <p>The first four Minecraft books have sold well, in part because they provide some of the tutorial content – from fighting to building – that isn’t in the game itself (even if it is available online as part of the <a href=\"http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecraft_Wiki\">official Minecraft Wiki</a>). The next book, Blockopedia, is a hexagonal-shaped tome exploring individual blocks from the game.</p> <p>“We didn’t want to make standard-type annuals with graphics all over the cover and every page a Where’s Waldo? Those type of things we weren’t interested in. We wanted to make it valuable: something that people would buy and treasure, instead of simply flipping through then tossing aside,” says Bui.</p> <p>“If you see the initial pages before our input, and the final product, it’s literally night and day. As a book publisher, Egmont were very concerned with things like the covers: that they look like a more mature book that wouldn’t fit the target audience. But we don’t have a target audience, we don’t look to a particular demographic.</p> <p>“We have younger people playing on mobile up to people on their 70s and 80s playing with their grandchildren. Yes, most of our customers are skewed towards the younger ages, but people of all ages can enjoy and appreciate them. The books stand out on the shelves, and we’re proud of that.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD-iVXglyTQ\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nD-iVXglyTQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>qCraft is one example of an educational Minecraft project: a mod that teaches quantum physics.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Minecraft as a brand isn’t just about commercial products. Bui is just as enthusiastic about MinecraftEdu, citing a stat that’s been circulating internally that 1m students have used it in schools.</p> <p>“It’s pretty exciting that a game is being used by teachers not just as a reward – do your classwork then you can play Minecraft for 15 minutes – but actually as an educational tool, with teachers developing a curriculum within the game,” he says.</p> <p>“It’s very interesting to think that in the future, there will be architects and city planners and all these types of people who grew up using Minecraft, and who’ll be applying those skills in ways that change the world.”</p> <p>The era of skyscrapers with chickens embedded in the walls beckons. But Block by Block shows the seriousness of Mojang’s intent to find out how Minecraft really can be used by people to take more of a role in urban planning: a bridge between citizens and professional architects, rather than trying to replace the latter.</p> <p>“We’ve got people in slum areas, many of whom have never used a computer, learning how to use Minecraft to have an input into the redesign and reconstruction of public spaces. It’s beyond being a game, to being used as a layman’s architectural tool,” says Bui.</p> <p>“Then the architect comes in and turns that into what can actually be built. You need that architect still! But previously there wasn’t a good way for local stakeholders to communicate with architects: they didn’t speak the same language. Now that communication can be done through Minecraft.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53ea25a0420ecec9e30aeecdbc90cead2fc195d6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412775655875/0080d534-42c8-42f6-88f6-dc042e4ffb04-460x282.jpeg\" alt=\"You can't buy official Minecraft cakes, but you can bake your own, as this Google search shows.\" width=\"460\" height=\"282\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can’t buy official Minecraft cakes, but you can bake your own, as this Google search shows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The conversation turns back to licensing, but not the big partnerships with the likes of Lego, Egmont and Warner Bros. How about people within the Minecraft community making and sharing... well, not necessarily products, but things: from knitted toys to birthday cakes? How does Mojang work with them?</p> <p>“We want people to be creative, and we are working on ways to help people to that. We have something coming out soon – in the next month or so hopefully – that will clarify what people can do with the brand,” says Bui.</p> <p>“It’s really amazing what people are doing out there. What’s not interesting to me is when people just take our existing graphics, slap them onto another product and sell it. There’s no reason those products should be out there. But our approach has always been soft: we talk to people and say ‘hey, this isn’t cool’ or ‘hey, this would be cool if you changed it in that way...’”</p> <p>It will be interesting to see how those new guidelines continue this softly-softly approach to brand protection. With Mojang in the process of being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/15/microsoft-buys-minecraft-creator-mojang-for-25bn\">bought by Microsoft for $2.5bn</a>, any misstep is likely to be brandished as evidence of a culture change under the new ownership, even if Microsoft has nothing to do with it.</p> <p>An interesting point: Bui says the guiding light behind Mojang’s policies is its desire to encourage creativity. “We get a number of emails a week asking if someone can get the licence for Minecraft birthday supplies: plates and hats and streamers,” he says.</p> <p>“But if you do a Google search for ‘Minecraft birthday’ you’ll see all kinds of creativity from families who went out to the store, didn’t find Minecraft stuff, and so created it themselves. Why would we want to put out the official Minecraft cake-topper then, when the game is all about creativity?</p> <p>“Once you put out the official one, people would buy it because it’d be easier than making it themselves. We’re more interested in what people make for themselves: it’s way more exciting for us to have people sitting together and having ideas for Minecraft parties, rather than us just selling some cheesy Minecraft products.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W33lOipsauU\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W33lOipsauU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Stampy is the world’s fourth most popular YouTube channel.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The last topic the Guardian discusses with Bui is Minecraft videos on YouTube, from the hugely-popular channels like Stampy and The Diamond Minecart to the videos uploaded by fans of all ages showing their exploits in the game.</p> <p>Bui says that Mojang’s approach to YouTube was defined very early on by the game’s creator, Notch, who ensured that people could use Minecraft assets, sounds and gameplay footage on YouTube without having to ask permission or share any of the resulting advertising revenues.</p> <p>Earlier in 2014, <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/nintendos-lets-play-drama-might-have-a-happy-ending-513818999\">Nintendo was criticised</a> for filing copyright claims against some YouTubers uploading “Let’s Play” videos of its games, inserting its own ads, which left the video creators unable to earn money from their work. Nintendo <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/218572/Nintendo_reveals_YouTube_affiliate_program_for_Lets_Players.php\">said it was working on an affiliate program</a> to share revenues with YouTubers, but its approach was still compared – often negatively – with Mojang’s hands-off policy.</p> <p>“We have a whole slew of people who are making their entire living just off making videos about Minecraft. Just the economics of that – how many people are making a living off this one IP – is pretty awesome,” says Bui.</p> <p>“That doesn’t take anything away from us, and I would say it actually adds value to Minecraft, to have people who are extremely talented and creative doing things. We’ve essentially outsourced YouTube videos to a community of millions of people, and what they come up with is more creative than anything we could make ourselves.”</p> <p>There are limits: Mojang’s rule is that uploading videos to YouTube is fine, but selling them on iTunes or other video-on-demand services is not – the key being whether creators are charging fans.</p> <p>“There’s no damage to us from YouTube. We might have some people who make content we might not agree with, but this is how the democratisation of media works. You put it out there and let the community decide,” says Bui. “If someone’s putting out rubbish, the community is not going to watch it, and it won’t rise to the top.”</p> <p>The sheer scale of Minecraft as a brand, a community and a cultural touchpoint means Mojang won’t always be able to avoid criticism and online backlashes over the way it manages the game.</p> <p>A recent controversy over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/24/minecraft-how-a-change-to-the-rules-is-tearing-the-community-apart\">how players can and can’t make money from the Minecraft servers that they run</a> is the latest proof of that. Even so, Bui says that Mojang’s desire to retain its focus as a games studio, as well as its respect for the community around Minecraft, will serve it well.</p> <p>“As I said, we want to make most of our money from selling games. We’re not here to penny-pinch the creatives out there using our property to create cool content,” he says. “We have this massive group of people creating amazing things. Why would we want to hinder that in any way?”</p> <p>• <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/05/minecraft-33-million-users\">Minecraft: a personal story by the Guardian’s Keith Stuart</a></strong><br />• <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/03/youtube-apps-minecraft-digital-kids\">YouTube, apps and Minecraft: digital kids and children’s media</a></strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412766814916/2d41802c-fdda-4664-ade2-77a4ffad2b73-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/08/minecraft-movies-youtube-mojang-licensing","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/oct/08/minecraft-movies-youtube-mojang-licensing","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"When it comes to aid, learn from those who know what poverty is really like | Erik Solheim","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-08T13:02:14Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/08/aid-donors-brazil-china-africa","fields":{"body":"<p>The rise of emerging economies such as Brazil and China has not only lifted millions of people out of poverty, but offers new opportunities and resources for development elsewhere.</p> <p>China, which is poised to become the world’s largest economy, is now a major source of aid and private investment for development, providing 20% of private foreign direct investment in developing countries. Brazil’s foreign aid budget has increased fivefold since 2005. Turkey gives more of its national income in aid than the average Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) country, while the United Arab Emirates is the most generous of today’s donors, handing over 1.25% of its national income for development assistance (<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/development-co-operation-report-20747721.htm\" title=\"\">see chapter 3 of the OECD’s development cooperation report 2014</a>).</p> <p>The contribution of emerging donors to global development could be even greater through closer cooperation with traditional donors. The 29 member countries of the OECD’s development assistance committee account for 90% of global development aid and have decades of experience behind them. Yet, they can learn a lot from countries that have recently made the transition out of poverty and know from their own experiences which policies work best.</p> <p>So-called south-south cooperation has proven effective in creating jobs, building infrastructure and promoting trade. Developing countries now account for more than a third of global trade, and the value of south-south trade is almost equal to that of north-north. Trade not only creates growth but enables the transfer of knowledge, technology and skills. A recent wave of south-south <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_swap\" title=\"\">currency swap</a> agreements between China, India and their trading partners, to protect against exchange rate fluctuations, is just one example of the kind of innovations that traditional donors can learn from.</p> <p>Traditional aid can also be channelled into helping less developed countries make the transition from exporting raw materials to building manufacturing industries. Chinese and Indian companies are outsourcing manufacturing to Africa, providing jobs for many of the 1 million young people who are joining the labour market there every month.</p> <p>South-south direct investment is growing by 20% every year. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/30/chinese-investment-ethiopia-shoe-city\" title=\"\">The Chinese company Huajian, a designer shoemaker, opened an Ethiopian factory in 2012 with 550 employees</a>. The factory now employs 3,500 Ethiopians. Dozens of new textile factories, including about 50 from Turkey, have started operations in Ethiopia, supporting the country’s aim to become the continent’s manufacturing powerhouse. Traditional donors can support the creation of manufacturing industries in various ways, including by helping to mitigate financial risk.</p> <p>Infrastructure is another area that is critical for development. Billions of dollars are needed to bring electricity to the 1.3 billion people who lack access to it. Huge investments are also needed to build roads, railways and telecommunication networks in developing countries. China is already financing much of this critical infrastructure, for example, a planned <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-27368877\" title=\"\">railway linking Kenya with Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan</a>.</p> <p>More funds could be freed up in the developed world for such projects. Sovereign wealth and pension funds in OECD countries are sitting on an incredible $83tn but less than 1% of this is directly invested in infrastructure. Large sums could be mobilised if funds in OECD countries followed the lead of those in Latin American and allocated 3% of their holdings to infrastructure investments.</p> <p>If the world is to meet its goals for sustainable development, traditional donors must think more globally, cooperate more closely with emerging donors and mobilise the huge sums that exist in untapped resources.</p> <p><em>• Erik Solheim is chair of the </em><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/\" title=\"\"><em>OECD’s development assistance committee</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412771377624/f2a97c02-3d5a-44ad-ad36-4435a600653c-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/08/aid-donors-brazil-china-africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/08/aid-donors-brazil-china-africa","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"The challenge of filling the skills gap in emerging economies","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-07T14:35:26Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/2014/oct/07/the-challenge-of-filling-the-skills-gap-in-emerging-economies","fields":{"body":"<p>High levels of investment in human capital and strong education systems are drivers of economic growth. From Germany to Japan, economic powerhouses can attribute much of their success to their heavy investment in human capital. </p> <p>In the US, President Obama has authorised federal funding for cities and states to conduct job training programs via the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which stems from the wide recognition that the nation’s workforce needs to be future-ready and that the widening skills gap needs to be addressed now more than ever. For all these nations and more, skills are a precious commodity and good education systems are what set them apart from other high-growth economies that simply rely on physical capital.</p> <p>So here’s the challenge: how can emerging economies ensure they don’t stumble as they attempt to fill their skills gap, and how can developing economies ensure their skills gap does not turn into a ‘skills trap’ from which there is no escape?</p> <p>Nowhere are skills more in demand than in emerging economies, according to a <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/hr-management-services/key-trends-in-human-capital-2012-a-global-perspective.jhtml\">human capital study</a> by PwC. At one point in time, these countries relied on cheap labour to fuel their export-driven economies. But their economic model is changing and, as a result, they have to rapidly move up the value chain – or risk faltering.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.manpowergroup.com/wps/wcm/connect/587d2b45-c47a-4647-a7c1-e7a74f68fb85/2013_Talent_Shortage_Survey_Results_US_high+res.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\">Talent Shortage Survey</a> (pdf) by global employment agency Manpower Group, skills shortages prevented 45% of employers in the Asia-Pacific region filling vacancies. In India, this number soared to 61% of employers, while in Brazil 68% had trouble recruiting the right workforce. Developing nations have to narrow the skills gap and “produce more workers capable of doing talent intensive jobs that require higher qualifications”.</p> <p>While this shortage in human capital can be seen as a weakness, it is also presents a huge opportunity for economic growth. Developing and emerging economies – with populations that are overwhelmingly young and hungry for professional advancement – can turn themselves into “factories of talent,” instead of being the cheaply-staffed workbenches of the developed world. </p> <p>Currently, however, the education systems in many of these countries don’t provide the right kind of training that would fill the skills gap. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this claim. For example, developing countries do not have enough resources to purchase tools to build modern skills. There are also hard numbers: in two of the fastest growing emerging economies in the world – Turkey and Brazil – nearly 10% of all companies report that poorly educated workforces are the main constraint on their growth.</p> <p>This is particularly apparent when it comes to filling jobs that require technical skills, especially engineers, technicians and IT staff. According to the Talent Shortage Survey, a shocking 71% of companies in Brazil are struggling to recruit for such posts. And in India – despite the country’s many and fabled Indian Institutes of Technology – it’s still a massive 48%.</p> <p>It would be wrong, though, to blame governments and education systems for all these problems. Rapidly growing economies will always struggle to fill their skills pipeline in an ordered way – especially given today’s rapid technological climate. Skills-training designed by civil servants at their desks five years ago are obviously already outdated.</p> <p>To combat these issues, emerging economies can start with the most fundamental point: the private sector is experiencing the most skills shortages. Companies that use their assets to close the skills gap – working closely with governments to leverage the resources and structure of the education system – are best positioned to boost human capital in developing and emerging economies. </p> <p>Samsung, for example, is building up a global network of Tech Institutes to help students learn engineering and technical skills after school. The programme was first launched in Africa in 2011, with the goal of educating 10,000 engineers in Africa by 2015. Training programmes are also being set up in South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Turkey, Indonesia and Russia. </p> <p>Tech company Honeywell, through its Initiative for Science &amp; Engineering (HISE), is also working in this area through partnering with universities in developing regions such as China, India and Mexico. Since launching HISE in 2006, Honeywell has been giving students exposure to science and maths by sponsoring discussions with Honeywell’s top technologists and engineers, as well as 23 Nobel laureates to date.</p> <p>Of course, in the grand scheme of things, these numbers reached are still small and there is much work to do. We need to continue to mobilise corporate citizenship arms of other businesses to help ensure that the skills gap does not harm developing nations, and does not trap them in a culture that breeds dependency.</p> <p>Private businesses have a critical role to play: they not only have a moral imperative, but it also makes business sense too. Companies can’t just sit back and wait for fully trained workers to appear out of thin air and start queuing at their factory gates and office doors. </p> <p><em>Seokpil Kim is chief citizenship officer &amp; head of global marketing operation at Samsung</em></p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/01/businesses-base-pyramid-partner-ngos-poor-communities\">Businesses selling to the poor should think twice before working with NGOs</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/01/nine-practical-tips-building-sustainable-business-india\">Nine practical tips for building a sustainable business in India</a></li> <li><strong>Advertisement feature:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/24/business-call-to-action-forum-multinationals\">Multinationals reaffirm commitment to BoP business with BCtA</a></li> </ul> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/role-business-development\">The role of business in development</a> hub is funded by Business Call to Action.

The smart slum is still a peripheral idea, but we can speculate on the likely impact of <a href=\"http://www.ovum.com/slums-must-form-part-of-the-smart-city-movement/\">extending this ‘smartness’</a> to slums and make two competing claims. Firstly, that development professionals should be wary of smart slums repeating some of the negative impacts of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development\">ICT4D</a>; and secondly, that a push for smart slums could be appropriated for social justice.</p> <p>The idea of the smart city is a vision of a networked urbanism. The promise is that environmental monitoring and feedback from <a href=\"http://www.libelium.com/top_50_iot_sensor_applications_ranking/#show_infographic\">embedded sensors</a> everywhere will simultaneously deliver greener and more productive cities. The idea has been most fully materialised in brand new cities like <a href=\"http://www.songdo.com/songdo-international-business-district/the-city/master-plan.aspx\">Songdo</a> in South Korea but is <a href=\"http://www.connectedurbandevelopment.org/\">spreading to established urban centres</a> like San Francisco, Amsterdam and Madrid.</p> <p>The smart city itself is by no means a new idea. In previous decades it had labels like cybernetic or connected city, but it has been given a new lease of life by the flowering of small, cheap and adaptable sensors that draw on smartphone technologies and DIY electronics (think <a href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/\">Arduino</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theinternetofthings.eu/\">Internet of Things</a>). For people working in development this comes with an attractive new feature; the smart city of today is seen as participatory. Feedback and monitoring includes the active participation of citizens who install smart metrics and sensors (such as the Arduino-based <a href=\"http://www.smartcitizen.me/pages/sck\">Smart Citizen Kit</a>, which measures temperature, humidity, noise, CO2 and NO2 levels), contribute data, and become part of a kind of sensor citizenship. The smart slum also makes sense as a way to bridge the infrastructure gap; by adding programmable intelligence to services that are extended in to slums (such as sensors that <a href=\"http://www.libelium.com/smart_water_wsn_pipe_leakages/\">report the water flow in pipes</a> and send alerts if water use is outside of the expected normal range), they can be managed in a way that is responsive and well-adapted to the ever-shifting environments of informal settlements. <br /></p> <p>The idea of smart slums shares a great deal with the way slum mapping has adopted new technologies and participatory processes. A decade or so ago, a coalition of NGOs and women’s networks <a href=\"http://eau.sagepub.com/content/14/2/225.short\">mapped hundreds of Pune’s slum settlements</a>, with the aim of bringing poor communities into the official mechanisms of city planning, so that they would get a better share of resources. More recently, the <a href=\"http://www.mapkibera.org/\">Map Kibera</a> project has used the participatory technologies of GPS and <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.500/-0.100\">OpenStreetMap</a> to enable residents of Kenya’s biggest slum to make a digital map of their streets and alleyways. Map Kibera is meant as a platform for empowerment; giving residents a way to monitor and report on their own experiences of government initiatives. <br /></p> <p>But smart slums could still repeat the <a href=\"http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/25561/\">problematic cycle of first generation ICT4D</a> if the technologies are dropped into communities without an effort to build the capacity of poorer citizens to use them. Many funding evaluation reports and academic studies show how ineffective the tech-led approach can be, and how it <a href=\"http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1107/1027\">can reinforce existing divides</a>. Moreover, the whole idea of monitoring, like mapping, should be approached with caution. Mapping and measurement were the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYL4pVUW7Lg\">original mechanisms of colonial control</a> and projects that simply add visibility without agency risk reinforcing the status quo. It may also be that sensors and smartness paradoxically limit citizenship rather than extending it, if citizens just participate by generating data and real resource decisions are made elsewhere. This is a dystopian version of smart slums as a way to subdue and control. <br /></p> <p>So how could smart slums be done differently? One approach is being tested through bottom-up citizen science. The approach of these projects (like our own <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CitSciKS\">Kosovo Science for Change</a>) draws on critical pedagogies like that of 1960s educator <a href=\"http://www.freire.org/paulo-freire/\">Paulo Freire</a>, for whom learning was the co-operative activity of understanding how our lived experience is constructed, and how to make a difference in the world. These projects involve citizens in using embedded sensor technology to answer their own questions about their environments. The approach would be familiar to development professionals as participatory community development but with added elements of <a href=\"http://www.raisinggeeks.com/blog/maker-movement/\">maker culture</a> – fablabs and hackerspaces – and empirical methods. <br /></p> <p>If applied in the context of smart slums, these methods could be part<br />of a new politics of infrastructure. As every part of traffic, water,<br />energy and waste systems become direct generators of data they raise new questions of governance. Now that we can see what’s going on and have the computational ability to influence it, who gets to decide how it’s<br />managed? The answer doesn’t just depend on companies and government but on the potential for citizens to prototype their own solutions.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/staff/d-mcquillan/\">Dan McQuillan</a> is a lecturer in creative and social computing at <a href=\"http://www.gold.ac.uk/\">Goldsmiths</a>, University of London.

But what do we mean by sustainability? What are the roles of industry, government and consumers? And what are the tools and models we will need?</p> <p>These were some of the questions addressed at a recent roundtable event, hosted by the Guardian in association with Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board, and attended by representatives from academia, civil society and private sector organisations.</p> <h2><strong>What is sustainability?</strong></h2> <p><strong><br /></strong>The roundtable grappled first with the concept of sustainability itself, and how we break it down into something more manageable. For Keith Kenny, head of sustainability at McDonalds, it’s defined by what he called the “three Es”: ethics, environment and economic viability.</p> <p>“If we’d had this debate five years ago, there would have been different opinions, but there’s more alignment now,” he said. “It’s always going to be a balance of those three.”</p> <p>Within that, there’s a further “basket of issues”, according to Hugh Jones, director of the Carbon Trust. “There’s a need for better policy and healthier lifestyles at the consumer end,” he said. “Food waste is a big problem, and you need to factor in water and climate change too.”</p> <p>Mark Pettigrew, agricultural sustainability manager for Europe at PepsiCo, echoed this sentiment, calling for a systemic approach to the concept. “It’s important to take a whole value-chain approach, from production through to consumption,” he said. “There are real challenges of poverty, obesity and inequity across the food system, and tackling it requires collaboration across the value chain.”</p> <p>In 2012, Bord Bia announced a plan to get every Irish farmer and food and drink manufacturer signed up to the sustainability agenda. The voluntary “Origin Green” programme requires farmers to undertake regular sustainability assessments, while manufacturers develop multi-annual plans with clear targets in areas such as sourcing, emissions, energy, waste, water and biodiversity, and social sustainability.<br /></p> <p>“Ireland prides itself on being green,” said Aidan Cotter, chief executive of Bord Bia. “There’s a huge world opening up around sustainability, and it’s no longer good enough to just talk about it. We have to prove we can do it. So we’ve set ourselves the goal that, by 2016, every farming and food manufacturing business will be signed up to this.”</p> <h2><strong>Supply chain risk</strong></h2> <p><strong><br /></strong>For many multinational corporations and large retailers, the sustainability of supply chains has already become an essential part of risk management, as their own long-term future depends on the viability of those who provide their inputs. Earlier this year, for example, the supermarket chain Asda revealed that 95% of its entire fresh produce range is already at risk from climate change. In 2012, confectionery giant Mondelez International launched a $400m Cocoa Life sustainability programme to support its cocoa-producing communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"045f85f9b87565df093a3e70df602b6333f61068\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/2/1412264346966/fcbadbb0-8d15-4a6e-b31f-e6c8aa023935-339x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Inder Poonaji, head of sustainability at Nestlé\" width=\"339\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It used to be just economics but now we’re looking at how we sustain the communities around these farms’ – Inder Poonaji, head of sustainability at Nestlé.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Drew Turner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“For us it is about the idea of creating shared value, which has brought a new lens for looking at things,” said Inder Poonaji, head of sustainability at Nestlé. “It used to be just economics but now, with more responsible sourcing guidelines, we’re looking at how we sustain the communities around these farms in future – because we know that if we don’t, they’re not going to exist.”</p> <p>One of the barriers to sustainability in global value chains is the sheer scale of them, and the difficulty of measuring and standardising within such a broad concept. Nestlé uses a tool called Rise (Response-Inducing Sustainability Evaluation), developed by the University of Bern to assess the sustainability of agricultural production at the level of the individual farm, with data analysed against 10 sustainability indicators, including soil use, animal husbandry, nutrient flows and biodiversity.</p> <p>More widespread access to basic technology is also proving useful in developing countries, said John Steel, chief executive of Cafedirect. “We’ve recently launched a technology platform called WeFarm, an SMS-based peer-to-peer learning network for farmers. It means that if farmers see frost on a plant in Kenya, they can post a question through their phone and get an answer about what to do. We’re trying to remove the barriers that the chain puts in the way, and make it more collaborative at grassroots level.”</p> <p>A multitude of certification schemes have also emerged over the years, aimed at making value chains more equitable, for producers in developing countries in particular. However, many at the roundtable suggested certification in the food and drink sector has become unwieldy – the Ecolabel Index currently lists 148 labels for the food sector alone.</p> <p>“I see it as industry-filtered, with some civil society filtering too, but you’ve basically got a patchwork quilt with lots of initiatives and gaps. This is where state agency becomes really important,” said David Barling, reader in food policy at City University, London.</p> <h2><strong>Abdicating responsibility</strong></h2> <p><strong><br /></strong>Although some consumers feel confident interpreting the various kitemarks, most would prefer to outsource responsibility for sustainable choices to the retailers who still sell us the majority of our food, said Cotter. “Consumers expect food on the shelves to be produced sustainably.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b037524d515215e56e65817875544076748068b3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/2/1412264713107/41bf79c8-5c19-4f49-a670-d02d085e61a2-311x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tim Hess, reader in water management, Cranfield University\" width=\"311\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“Most consumers think that if they shop from a particular place they will do the right thing,” says Tim Hess, reader in water management, Cranfield University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Drew Turner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tim Hess, reader in water management at Cranfield University, agreed that supermarkets have come to play a pivotal role as gatekeepers to sustainability. “Most consumers are making choices through where they buy from, thinking that if they shop from a particular place they will do the right thing, and if they go to another place it will be cheap,” he said.</p> <p>But while some retailers compete on sustainable credentials, there was a consensus at the roundtable that achieving a step-change in sustainable food depends on greater pre-competitive collaboration.</p> <p>The Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme (WRAP) was held up as one good example, having initiated the Courtauld Commitment under which food and drink businesses including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Unilever and Nestlé have committed to work together to reduce food, packaging and supply-chain waste.</p> <p>The drive towards sustainability is often channelled through specific routes – labelling, diets, retailer commitments, or global commodity roundtables, such as that for <a href=\"http://grsbeef.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">beef</a>, but there are other methods too, said Mark Driscoll, head of food at Forum for the Future, who described some early-stage work his organisation has been doing with the <a href=\"https://www.unglobalcompact.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UN Global Compact</a>.</p> <p>“This is about moving beyond the farm-by-farm approach, and looking at more regional or country-based approaches, linking businesses, communities and civil society organisations. How can we provide the tools and techniques for local decision makers to really make sustainable agriculture mainstream? It’s a challenge, and we’ll need to think slightly more out of the box.”</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest challenge is still achieving the third “E”: economic viability. As Justin McCarthy, editor of the Irish Farmers Journal pointed out, farmers are in the worst position. “They’re in the middle. Their inputs – such as fertilisers - are controlled by three or four large companies, and then there’s a concentrated network of processors and retailers at the other end that sets the price. It puts a huge squeeze on their profitability.”</p> <p>In the end, as McCarthy pointed out, retailers respond to what consumers (and shareholders) want. Low prices is one thing they certainly want and, according to Melissa Barrett, director of sustainability services at Accenture, grasping their social, ethical and environmental values will be an even bigger challenge in years to come.</p> <p>“We’ve done research on what we call tomorrow’s consumers, and the movement of information with younger generations is so fast, and no longer just about identifying with a sustainability label,” she said. “It’s about what links into my values at the time, and what my peers are communicating about.”</p> <p>A more sustainable food industry is certainly achievable, but as McDonald’s’ Kenny pointed out, sustainability is a moving target. “We know what best practice is now, but we’ll know more next year. It’s not a destination – it’s a journey, and we have to keep moving.”</p> <h2>Key points</h2> <p>• FAO estimates of greenhouse gas data released earlier this year showed that emissions from agriculture, forestry and fisheries have nearly doubled over the past 50 years and may increase by another 30% by 2050, unless greater action is taken.</p> <p>• A 2013 report by the UK’s Institution of Mechanical Engineers – Global Food; Waste Not, Want Not – found that 30%-50% of food produced around the world is wasted.</p> <h2>At the table</h2> <p><strong>Oliver Balch (Chair)</strong> Freelance journalist, the Guardian</p> <p><strong>David Barling</strong> Reader in food policy, City University, London</p> <p><strong>Melissa Barrett</strong> Director of sustainability services, Accenture</p> <p><strong>Padraig Brennan</strong> Senior business analyst, Bord Bia</p> <p><strong>Aidan Cotter</strong> CEO, Bord Bia</p> <p><strong>Tim Hess</strong> Reader in water management, Cranfield University</p> <p><strong>Hugh Jones</strong> Director, Carbon Trust</p> <p><strong>Keith Kenny</strong> Head of sustainability, McDonalds Europe<br /></p> <p><strong>Justin McCarthy</strong> Editor, Irish Farmers Journal</p> <p><strong>Mark Pettigrew</strong> Agricultural sustainability manager, Europe, PepsiCo</p> <p><strong>Inder Poonaji</strong> Head of sustainability, Nestlé</p> <p><strong>John Steel</strong> CEO, Cafédirect</p> <p><strong>Mark Driscoll</strong> Head of Food Forum for the Future</p> <p><strong>Roundtable report</strong> commissioned and controlled by the Guardian. <strong>Discussion </strong>hosted to a brief agreed with Bord Bia. <strong>Funded </strong>by Bord Bia.

In Kenya’s ASALs, drought is the most pervasive hazard, encountered by households on a widespread level. More than three million pastoralist households are regularly hit by increasingly severe droughts, <a href=\"http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=321064616&amp;Country=Kenya&amp;topic=Economy\">costing the economy an estimated $12.1bn between 2008 and 2011</a>. For livelihoods that rely mainly on livestock, the high livestock mortality rate caused by drought has devastating effects, rendering these pastoralists among the most vulnerable populations in Kenya. As the impacts of climate change unfold, the link between drought risk, vulnerability and poverty becomes significantly stronger.</p> <p>Over the past several years, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), in collaboration with Cornell University and technical partners, has pursued a research program aimed at designing, developing and implementing insurance products to protect livestock keepers from drought-related asset losses. Using satellite imagery to assess the amount of forage available, Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) provides insured pastoralists with a pay-out in times of drought based on predicted rather than actual livestock deaths.</p> <p>In order to launch IBLI as a commercial product, ILRI and Takaful Insurance of Africa came together in August 2013 to offer a sharia-compliant version of IBLI in Wajir County with plans of expansion into other areas of northern Kenya later this year.

For example, it offers mutual or “community insurance”, whereby the insurer charges a set fee, rather than applying interest, which in sharia-law can be seen as a form of gambling.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21601022-new-kind-insurance-may-protect-herders-against-drought-insure-my-cows\">CEO of Takaful Insurance of Africa, Hassan Bashir</a>, was born into a cattle-herding Somali family, and as Kenya’s first sharia-compliant insurance company, he wanted to solve his community’s biggest problem – the loss of livestock due to drought.</p> <p>Takaful requires that those who need protection participate in a risk pooling scheme. Fund participants are grouped into geographically defined areas that have a set contribution based on local pasture conditions and they receive an indemnity when predicted livestock mortality from drought rises above the trigger level.</p> <p>One of the biggest challenges facing Index Based Livestock Takaful (IBLT) is consumer education to catalyse demand. The communities in the target areas have low written literacy levels, radio coverage is limited to near town centres, and mobile phone coverage can be sporadic. Finally, as a pastoral population, worse weather means that more members of the community are trekking with their animals to find better pasture, which impacts who is available to purchase.</p> <p>This situation is further compounded by the fact that these communities have had little or no prior experience with insurance. It takes them time to trust the product and overcome their preconceived notions of its compliance with sharia law. Further, due to low levels of liquidity, pastoralists must often consider selling an animal in order to pay for the premium. As a result, many pastoralists buy small, less expensive contracts for “shoats” (sheeps &amp; goats) to test the product before they pay the more expensive premiums for cattle and camels.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the scheme has had its successes. In March 2014, all 101 policyholders received a payout for a low level of drought in the area and sales between August/September 2013 and January/February 2014 grew by 138% with the expense ratio to Takaful Insurance decreasing by 100%.</p> <p>In order for IBLT to reach scale and commercial sustainability, plans are underway to expand across the Greater Horn of Africa starting with Somalia, as Takaful Insurance has recently opened offices in Mogadishu and Hargeisa. Critical distribution infrastructure, such as mobile phone coverage and mobile money, as well as FM radio coverage is almost complete in areas of Takaful Insurance’s operation. So far, the Index-Based Livestock Insurance program has been linked to a 50% drop in ‘distress’ sales of livestock to raise cash in times of drought, a 33% reduced likelihood of having to eat significantly smaller meals and a 33% reduction in dependence on food aid.</p> <p>Leading research body CGIAR recently announced that it will dedicate at least <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29311473\">60% of its one $1bn annual budget to reaching more vulnerable people</a> with climate-smart initiatives such as Index-Based Livestock Insurance. The impacts seen in Kenya could be scaled up, but given the infrastructural and other challenges of east Africa’s drylands, it is not yet clear whether an IBLI product can be entirely commercially viable without subsidy support. Despite this, and even though IBLI does not offer complete protection against herd loss, it is a promising option for addressing poverty traps that arise from catastrophic drought risk. Uptake has had a range of benefits for those insured, including improved wellbeing and a reduction in drastic coping strategies when drought strikes.</p> <p><em>Bryn Davies is the market and capacity development manager at the International Livestock Research Institute.

Today, it has less than 2,000. The surface area of the Aral Sea in central Asia has dropped by half, from 66,000 to 33,000 square km, and <a href=\"http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/20795water-cooperature-sm.pdf\">the Dead Sea in the Middle East from almost 1,000 to 650 square km</a>.</p> <p>Fifty years from now, Lake Chad is at risk of disappearing altogether. Thirty years from now, the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea may become small lakes. China, the emerging superpower, may soon see Lake Poyang, its largest freshwater lake, evaporate – as many as 3,000 small lakes <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.br/clima/pdf/impactos_yellow.pdf\">in the source region of the Yellow River have done so in the last two decades</a>.</p> <p>As lakes disappear, rivers are either being depleted or severely polluted. <a href=\"http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/85801himalayan-challenge.pdf\">Large stretches of the Ganges, the Nile, and the Yangtze are already biologically dead</a>. Over the next thirty years, some of the mightiest rivers in the world – including the Yellow and the Yangtze, the Ganges and the Indus, the Euphrates and the Jordan, and the Nile – will see a reduction of at least 25-30% in their flow from evaporation, desertification, climate change, and pollution.</p> <p>The climate change debate is highly focused on atmospheric pollution and energy use, but there is a growing realisation of the close links between climatic and environmental factors and the future flow and quality of water through melting glaciers, deforestation, changes in precipitation, and emission of waste into fresh water.</p> <p>The next thirty years will also see a strong increase in demand for water – for hydroelectricity, irrigation, and urbanization. At the same time, <a href=\"http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/85801himalayan-challenge.pdf\">the 25-30% reduction in water flow will lead to a drop in food grain production</a> in China, India, Bangladesh, Egypt, and the Middle East.</p> <p>The net result of this decrease will be a gap between demand and supply of food grains of approximately <a href=\"http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/85801himalayan-challenge.pdf\">200 to 300 million tons by 2040 in international markets</a>. China and India, reasonably self-sufficient in 2014, may become major importers of food grains by 2040. If all this unfolds, commodity prices will skyrocket, affecting the poor worldwide and making food riots, migration, and conflicts within and between countries inevitable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"127e4dfc28934f0d73a564135232790be3f29df9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/30/1412073847208/ae78ff74-f73f-4954-99fd-bd1180c0783f-460x361.jpeg\" alt=\"Mega arc of hydro insecurity\" width=\"460\" height=\"361\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Areas of hydro insecurity</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Strategic Foresight Group</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The main theatre of crisis and conflict driven by depletion of water resources will be from south-east Asia via South Asia and Central Asia to Turkey and from Egypt along the eastern and central parts of Africa to Kenya and Burundi.</p> <p>What could change this ominous scenario? The good news is that mere decline in the availability of water does not necessarily lead to violence. <a href=\"http://www.strategicforesight.com/conference_pdf/99205Singapore%20Suggestions.pdf\">Singapore</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tufts.edu/water/pdf/WaterConflict/OusmaneDione.pdf\">Senegal</a> are examples of how to avoid conflict through good water governance and transboundary cooperation. A <a href=\"http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/20795water-cooperature-sm.pdf\">recent study by Strategic Foresight Group (SFG)</a> on 205 shared river basins from 148 countries concludes: “any two countries engaged in active water cooperation do not go to war for any reason whatsoever, including land, religion, economy or terrorism.” The key to peace thus lies in the intensity of cooperation as measured by <a href=\"http://strategicforesight.com/water-cooperation-map/\">the water cooperation quotient (WCQ)</a> the report introduces.</p> <p>The WCQ is a new tool developed by SFG and introduced to the international community by Jordan’s Prince Hassan, chair of the <a href=\"http://www.unsgab.org/\">United Nations Secretary-Generals’ Advisory Board on Water &amp; Sanitation</a>. It uses ten parameters – including economic, environmental, institutional, legal, political, and technical factors – to examine both legal and operational cooperation between countries that share a water body. Countries are assessed on a scale of 0 to 100, with countries at risk scoring below 35.</p> <p>To promote active water cooperation, <a href=\"http://www.strategicforesight.com/focus.php?id=2#.VCA_HfldV8E\">the Blue Peace framework</a> – which defines a structured process to turn water from a source of potential crisis to an instrument of cooperation – is essential. Specifically, it consists of creating regional mechanisms for cooperation, engaging mainstream political leaders from rival river-boardering countries, and enabling them to negotiate trade-offs between water and other public goods. Such mechanisms are already in place in Europe, North and South America, and West Africa.</p> <p>The next decade will see the emergence of global mechanisms – innovative legal and diplomatic instruments – for resolving water-related disputes and promoting transboundary water cooperation. If the international community mobilises political will behind the new architecture of water and peace, the alternative grim scenario of water war can still be averted before the world crosses the tipping point.</p> <p><em>Ilmas Futehally is executive director and co-founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.strategicforesight.com/index.php\"><em>Strategic Foresight Group</em></a><em>.

The next index is due in 2015 – will significant progress have been made? </p> <p>While there is much potential for good to come out of partnership, NGOs have to reconcile the fact that business can be both a challenge and an enabler. “We cannot escape the reality that many food and beverage companies are fueling an obesity epidemic through the products they produce, and the way they are marketed,” <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-van-ameringen/can-the-private-sector-he_b_4725802.html\">said Marc van Ameringen</a>, executive director of Gain.

Most of the arable land in Chad is in the southern region, furthest from the Sahara, and is characterised by poor soils, a long dry season with daily temperatures over 40C and a short rainy season. Farmers rely on peanuts, sorghum, sesame, millet and cassava for the bulk of their calories. These crops are grown within a slash-and-burn system with crop rotations of three or four years and then the land is allowed to regenerate native bush species.</p> <p>Traditionally, these fallow periods of woody plant growth was around 15 years. Today they average between three to five years. This change is due to population growth, and subsequently smaller parcels of land per family, and deforestation due to increased demand for fuel wood and charcoal. Farm families eat a diet high in carbohydrates, low in protein, and low in vitamins and minerals. <a href=\"http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/country/home/tags/chad\">Acute seasonal hunger and chronic malnutrition are common</a>.</p> <p>The pressure to increase production on dwindling land requires more intensive farming, but farmers cannot access fertilisers, irrigation and other technologies. What they can do is improve soils and conserve water through basic soil building methods (traditional to some cultures but not traditional to Chad) such as composting, intensive manure use, mulching, companion planting and green manure crops. These low-tech methods are also compatible with several innovative practices showing promise in other sub-Saharan countries. Agroforestry strategies such as farmer managed natural regeneration and fertiliser tree systems have been <a href=\"http://worldagroforestry.org/research/agroforestry-systems\">successfully promoted</a> in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.</p> <p>Subsistence livestock management in Chad needs also to be more intensive and productive. Livestock mostly range freely. Goats, chickens, guinea hens, and cows wander to find what they can. This strategy uses no fences, barns, feeding, water provision, and usually no veterinary services.</p> <p>The result is malnourished livestock that produce little milk, eggs or meat. Using pens or fencing would require much more labour to supply forage and water to the livestock, but this labour investment would be repaid with greater production within one season. It would also accumulate manure to build soils.</p> <p>The few agricultural development projects that exist in Chad, either through the government or NGOs, are small with limited outreach. Most <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/countries/chad\">outside aid</a> is focused on feeding programmes, refugee relief and public health campaigns but hunger and other health problems are only exacerbated by low farm production in Chad and neighbouring countries.</p> <p>Focusing greater resources on subsistence farmers would bring multiple benefits. Agricultural programmes should realise that millions of farmers face the choice between subsistence and hunger, not the choice between subsistence farming and market farming. Chad’s extension services, whether governmental or NGO, are very limited. One promising government project is a radio programme on agricultural topics, which includes expert commentary and listener questions via SMS. This project could be expanded to reach more districts and in more local languages. Face-to-face education is also needed. A cost-effective programme could be based on the “barefoot doctor” approach, which trains indigenous extension staff to work in their home region on a very personal level with little institutional infrastructure.</p> <p>Soil and water conservation methods, farmer field schools and village support groups could be promoted through such local staff. The reality is that to feed 9 billion people millions will have to feed themselves, in their own villages, with very low-tech methods. Markets only <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-holt-gimenez/feeding-nine-billion-five_b_5208388.html\">help people with money and infrastructure</a>. The analysis by the World Economic Forum, whether intended or not, shows that many countries need help that is simple, direct, cheap and decidedly not market-oriented.</p> <p><em>Gene Fifer is an agronomist with the </em><a href=\"http://mcc.org/\"><em>Mennonite Central Committee</em></a><em> in Moundou, Chad.

The US would have to cut slightly less, but transfer up to $634bn to make a fair contribution.</p> <p>But in a fair system of shared responsibility, most developing countries would be net receivers, says the report, released ahead of Ban Ki-moon’s climate summit in New York on Tuesday. Kenya would receive $2bn, and be allowed to increase its emissions by more than 50%, while Peru would be allowed to double its emissions and receive $6bn. South Africa would have to cut emissions only marginally, but would receive $13bn, and the Philippines would be given $6bn, although it would have to cut emissions by up to 46%.</p> <p>The first scientific attempt to link precise emission cuts and the money needed to hold temperatures to a 1.5C rise by 2025 takes UN data and calculates each country’s “fair share”. It does so by factoring in how much carbon each country has emitted historically, how much wealth it has and its population. The principle of fairness, and the right of some countries to receive support, are accepted in the UN climate talks.</p> <p>Given its population, wealth and limited historical responsibility, China could argue that it has the right to increase its emissions by about 40% by 2025, but if the world is to hold to a 1.5C target it needs to cut its emissions on today’s levels by 25% to 45%. “That difference could cost China up to $497bn – transfers that would need to be made via access to technology,” says the report.</p> <p>Equally, Russia is said to deserve financial help to move away from fossil fuels given its fall in emissions since the end of the USSR and its relative poverty. But Brazil would get almost no financial support and would have to reduce its emissions by 22% on 1990 levels to do its fair share.</p> <p>“In the Philippines we know we have to take action, and the analysis shows that on our own we can only increase our emissions by 40% or so by 2025, which is less than what is currently projected. We are struggling to stop the expansion of coal in order to meet that fair share,” said Lidy Nacpil, of the <a href=\"http://www.apmdd.org/\" title=\"\">Jubilee South-Asia/Pacific Movement on Debt and Development</a>.</p> <p>She added: “But the science also shows that the Philippines’ fair share will not be enough, and to stop climate change we must do more to reduce emissions than would be expected.</p> <p>“We are demanding the transfer of resources in order to do that, estimated here to be up to $9bn a year by 2030. We call this a part of the climate debt owed to us and it is needed if we are to confront climate change while still responding to the needs of people.</p> <p>“These deep cuts have to happen. That’s the realistic demand from people facing the full brutal force of climate change.”</p> <p>Asad Rehman, from Friends of the Earth, said: “It’s the wealthy industrial nations that are largely responsible for the climate crisis we currently face, so it’s only fair they face up to their responsibilities by making large cuts in their emissions and funding climate action in the developing world too.</p> <p>“It’s a basic moral principle that those with more responsibility have to take more action, and also that those with more wealth contribute more. What should each country do is an ethical question.”</p> <p>The fraught question of how responsibility for tackling climate change should be divided has dogged the UN climate talks for more than 20 years. Britain and other rich nations have argued that all countries should have broadly equal per capita emissions by 2050. But this is proving unacceptable in the talks for many developing countries. This is because it ignores historical responsibility for accumulating greenhouse gases emitted over the past 200 years, and because it gives a greater share of the remaining emissions that can be burned without causing catastrophic warming to rich countries.</p> <p>“Using UN data we can work out what the limit on climate pollution should be for the whole world,” said Sivan Kartha, senior scientist at the SEI and the report’s author. “[This approach] shows not just what the whole world has to do, but it also helps people answer the fundamental question of the UN climate talks: what should each country do?”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 22 September 2014 to add missing words to the final quote.

As the camera was set up, Amin, surrounded by henchmen, asked David Lomax what questions he had. David replied: \"I want to ask you, what happened to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/revealed-the-fate-of-idi-amins-hijack-victim-436181.html\" title=\"\">Dora Bloch</a>?\" Bloch was the elderly British woman who had disappeared during the Entebbe hijack of 1976 and had later been murdered. There was total silence before Amin roared with laughter at what he took to be a joke: \"Mr Lomax, you are a very brave man.\" When the interview began, David repeated the question. He followed up with: \"Do you eat the hearts of your enemies?\"</p><p>David, who has died aged 76, was one of the most admired BBC current affairs reporters. He was never a specialist correspondent, and his reports, for 24 Hours, Tonight, Nationwide, Newsnight and Panorama, ranged across Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Africa and the Middle East. In an era when the personality of the reporter did not deliberately fill the screen, there was a signature to his films that made him the one with whom every producer wanted to work. He was animated by a sympathy for the individual stories of those caught up in grim and extraordinary situations, and by his fierce sense of injustice. He was as fearless as he was courteous, and the clarity of his voice and lucidity of his writing, along with a hawkish eye for the ridiculous, exemplified the best aspects of the liberal tradition and independent voice of BBC journalism.</p><p>In 1979, he interviewed in Dublin a representative of the Irish National Liberation Army, which had claimed responsibility for the recent murder of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/mar/31/2\" title=\"\">Airey Neave</a>. In the Commons, there were angry calls for David to be prosecuted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. David, however, was always clear that the journalist's responsibility, in telling a story, was to ask the straight questions of anyone, including terrorists and tyrants.</p><p>David's films defined Newsnight in its first months on air in 1980. With his producer and close friend <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-mike-dutfield-1580286.html\" title=\"\">Mike Dutfield</a>, he chronicled the last days of white Rhodesia, disappearing into territory occupied by Robert Mugabe's Zanu forces. A few weeks after independence, returning to Zimbabwe, they were imprisoned as they uncovered the first indications of the nature of Mugabe's regime. Newsnight's editor, George Carey, arriving in Harare to seek their release, was met at the underground prison by the cheerful welcome of David and Mike, who had made friends with their warders. In 1982, reporting for Panorama from Beirut, under constant bombardment, pinned down by sniper fire, with a bullet through the back of David's jacket and their sound recordist wounded in the foot, they brought home the most memorable film of that war.</p><p>A tall craggy rock of a man, David was in some ways an unlikely television reporter; incredibly scruffy, usually wearing a vast shapeless woolly jersey, with a satchel overflowing with paper. His size, open face and straightforward friendliness to everyone smoothed his way through checkpoints and gained access to places he was never meant to see. In 1968, after the invasion of Czechoslovakia, he tried to bluff his way into the Russian military HQ in Prague brandishing an invitation to the general for a game of chess (he was a formidable player).</p><p>Though he was best known for his overseas reporting, much of his work dug into the grain of British life, away from the world of Westminster politics, which never much interested him. In 1989, as the Berlin Wall fell, David gained access to Hull prison; his report for Panorama, The Boys on B Wing, revealed the degrading conditions in which young boys under 16 were being held alongside adults. He claimed to know nothing of business but was fascinated by technology and won an award as business journalist of the year, which much amused him, for his interviews with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/06/steve-jobs-obituary\" title=\"\">Steve Jobs</a> (who walked out) and Bill Gates.</p><p>David was born in Normanby, North Yorkshire. He learned to fly during his national service in the RAF in Canada. He kept up his pilot's licence, taking a single engine Auster with two RAF friends to Nepal and back. His fascination with aircraft later informed a Panorama investigation into the Eurofighter, which led to the full legal force of BAE being launched unsuccessfully against the BBC. In 1958, David went to Brasenose College, Oxford, to study history; he claimed to have attended one lecture in three years but loved to return for reunions.</p><p>In 1961, he secured a BBC traineeship, which took him to Plymouth, Devon, where he was in the same newsroom as Hugh Scully, his lifelong friend. At Oxford he had met Judy Lawson, and they married in 1962. Judy introduced him to sailing, which came to be the compulsive interest of their lives. In 1985, in a shabby internal BBC manoeuvre, David was fired; he used his redundancy to buy a racing cruiser, Cloud Walker. They sailed to the Caribbean, sending postcards at every port to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-brian-wenham-1260662.html\" title=\"\">Brian Wenham</a>, the BBC director of television: \"Dear Brian, Thank you for the yacht.\" He returned to the BBC as a freelance and was on air more than ever before.</p><p>Other more ambitious voyages followed. Friends would receive postcards from Spitsbergen as he sailed far into the Arctic and the west and east coasts of Greenland, exploring waters only recently made navigable by the melting icecap. He and Judy crewed for six months on a Viking ship across the Atlantic in 1991. He was a vice commodore in the Royal Cruising Club, and as the years passed, his face become ever more weather-beaten and he seemed to become part of the sea and rugged landscape he so loved.</p><p>His home for many years was a rambling house outside Newbury, Berkshire, full of children, dogs, books, friendly argument and anecdote, and music, with David conducting a stream of friends for enormous suppers around the kitchen table. In the garden were his beehives. A pot of Lomax honey was invariably presented to interviewees; its label read \"Beenham Honey. By royal appointment to President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya, and\" – as the only person ever to have interviewed the Thai royal family – \"Her Majesty Queen Sirikit of Thailand\". In his last decade, he and Judy moved to Dartmoor, setting up a bed and breakfast, a magnet for his friends; an open invitation brought more than 200 of them to his 70th birthday.</p><p>Often the most respected journalists are difficult human beings when known close up. David was an exception, a man as much loved as admired; his unassailable generosity and restless, unpretentious nature bred a mischievous delight at the absurdity of power and an interrogative seriousness about its abuse. The BBC archive records 900 of his stories over more than 40 years; he taught generations of producers not just the craft but the values of humane reporting.</p><p>David is survived by Judy, his two sons, Alistair and Michael, three daughters, Jane, Megan and Emily, two&nbsp;foster daughters, Alicia and Laura, and 11 grandchildren.</p><p>• David Lomax, television reporter, born 18 May 1938; died 5 September 2014</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/11/1410434177518/David-Lomax-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/11/david-lomax","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/2014/sep/11/david-lomax","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"Why do you have to buy an iPhone 6 to get a working digital wallet?

The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/09/apple-iphone-6-bigger-thinner-faster\">new iPhone 6</a>, along with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/09/apple-watch-iwatch-wearable-device-smartwatch\">wearable Apple Watch</a>, will integrate mobile payments, which would basically allow you to purchase products at stores using only your device.</p> <p>Mobile payments in America could be a great innovation, updating one of the worst payment systems in the world and making trips to any store easier. <br /></p> <p>But there’s one more thing: limiting it to just new Apple products carries a cost. Your ability to use phones to pay for goods and services should not be limited to what phone you own, creating a divide between Apple haves and Apple have-nots. <br /></p> <p>There are compelling public policy reasons to open up this kind of mobile payment to everyone. Mobile payments can and should be universal. At their best, they increase access to the banking system for everyone by making payments easier. They improve commerce by making transactions quicker and more efficient, lowering costs. Countries like Kenya have integrated systems that allow consumers to pay for virtually anything by mobile phone, leaping past the US in offering that technological promise to virtually everyone. </p> <p>What’s the best way? Don’t look to Apple’s rivals. Look to using the US postal service as a financial services provider with mobile payment options.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c01808c0-42ae-4ffc-933d-c0768a37b3c0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410353983810/27d807c3-570b-4a2b-9fba-c4a19102aa12-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"post office\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The potential home of your next digital wallet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Rhodes/  Steve Rhodes/Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may sound far-fetched to choose the postal service, but it’s not as strange as you may think. The postal service has something most companies don’t: access to almost every American. That includes those <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/07/07/why-the-postal-service-should-offer-banking-services\">who don’t have bank accounts</a>, as Senator Elizabeth Warren has pointed out. <br /></p> <p>Most corporations who have tackled mobile payments have failed at it. Several companies have rolled out mobile payment options over the past several years. But none offer the convenience of using text-based payment services for all purchases. Amazon’s beta version of a digital wallet only allows users to store gift or membership cards. Ebay’s Paypal system is great for online purchases and user-to-user transfers, but doesn’t work so well for going into an actual store. Smaller sites like Venmo and Cover and Gopago and others have had to line up merchants one by one to accept mobile payments.</p> <p>But Apple Pay would represent a serious step forward. Thanks to “near field communication” technology, Apple’s new phone and watch devices would allow users to scan their phone on a sensor to pay for things. The phone would basically act like whatever credit or debit card you link to your Apple Pay account. </p> <p>Apple has been able to get a level of cooperation that most companies couldn’t. It has teamed with credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard on the venture. And unlike its competitors, Apple has made a deal with the five largest credit card issuers – American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Capital One and Bank of America. They have agreed to offer lower fees on Apple Pay transactions through their credit cards. That gives retailers a powerful reason to equip their stores with Apple Pay-enabled devices, because they wouldn’t be charged as much on each transaction. Combine that with the millions of Apple users (over 800 million have accounts on iTunes), and plenty of retailers could be enticed to expand their acceptance of mobile payments.</p> <p>Retailers like Uber, Starbucks, Target, Nordstrom, McDonald’s and reportedly CVS and Walgreens have signed on. Apple Pay launches in October with 220,000 merchant locations; it will even be accepted at Disney World.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1b902b2e-bd5b-4145-a0db-232f564778a7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410354227403/f9169e08-f135-457e-aa72-942dd93f160b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Disney\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Things you can buy with Apple Pay: everything at Disney resorts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marsaili McGrath/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the only consumers able to take advantage of this would be those with an iPhone 6 or Apple Watch. Apple’s clear intention in owning the digital wallet is to create more value for their products; they’re not going to create an app out for use on other phones. And that’s a shame, because our banking system needs a working digital wallet.<br /></p> <p>This creates several potential problems. First are the security risks, where stealing a phone would now be, temporarily at least, equal to stealing a wallet. Apple will seek to reduce this threat with a one-step cancellation tool, and by authenticating Apple Pay through a fingerprint scanner on the iPhone. But the fingerprint scanner has already raised questions about privacy. And considering the recent hack of Apple’s iCloud storage that led to the release of nude celebrity pictures, consumers might not want to centralize their financial and medical information with the same company.</p> <p>If Apple can hurdle past the security challenges, the company would have a near-monopoly on mobile payments, leaving behind the millions of people who cannot afford an iPhone. This could have a real-world cost. Retailers often entice customers by reducing prices when they pay in cash. Cheaper transaction fees through Apple’s mobile payments network could help the Apple Pay system for the same reasons; if it costs a retailer far less to convert an Apple payment, they would want to encourage more of them. <br /></p> <p>At that point, you have people who cannot afford an iPhone effectively paying a tax on their purchases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-92ea79bf-91df-4c6d-8e21-de6ef98efb59\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410354563236/adbf0171-1161-442d-8159-437f25c861c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"whole foods\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All Americans deserve to have a working payments system -- not just those who can afford expensive smartphones and organic produce.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JEFF HAYNES/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mobile payments can also actually limit fraud, which is so prevalent with easily breached credit cards where personal data can be quickly stolen and re-used. Nearly half of all credit card fraud in the world occurred in the US in 2012, because our security systems are so lax. This can re-create our banking infrastructure, making it more secure and modern.</p> <p>But if mobile payments are limited to iPhone users, you’ve just extended the problems of inequality into the payment system. <br /></p> <p>We have a better solution right in front of us, with the US postal service. Over the past year, policymakers and activists have urged the postal service to add basic financial services, to rescue the tens of millions of Americans who have no bank account of their own. <br /></p> <p>Because the post office would be starting from scratch, they could incorporate a mobile payment app into their offerings, using the same technology (which is available on all phones) but expanding it beyond Apple devices. The postal service could serve as the backbone for a new system that would improve payments for individuals and small businesses, and give people more control over how to spend their money.</p> <p>Mobile payments are coming to America one way or another. Once you let private companies control access, they inevitably narrow it. With its 35,000 locations and the potential for millions of bank accounts, the Postal Service would have just as much leverage to offer a better payment system, one that would not depend on your brand of phone. <br /></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/10/1410365941614/4d940dac-db8f-415d-93f4-c0f207da3ec7-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/sep/10/apple-pay-new-mobile-payments-should-be-for-everyone","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/sep/10/apple-pay-new-mobile-payments-should-be-for-everyone","sectionName":"Money"},{"webTitle":"iPhone 6 size draws battle line with Samsung and other Android makers","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-09T22:39:11Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2014/sep/09/bigger-iphone-battle-android-samsung-apple-iphone-6-phablet","fields":{"body":"<p>Apple is belatedly joining an evolutionary shift that has been driving the rest of the phone market for years. Its new larger screened phones will principally chase users in its two biggest markets: China and the US – but also gives it the weapons to compete directly with Android handset makers who staked a claim to large-screened handsets years earlier.</p> <p>While the iPhone’s screen crept up from 3.5in (measured diagonally) to 4in in 2012 with the launch of the iPhone 5, other manufacturers – notably their chief rival Samsung – have been pushing first above 4.5in and then over 5in and 5.5in.</p> <p>Consumers clearly want bigger screens. In the US, RBC Capital Markets in June found that 35% of people who would not otherwise consider a new iPhone would do so for a larger screen. Kantar Research also <a href=\"http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global/News/The-last-mile-in-smartphone-buying\">found</a> that screen size was the most important element of the phone design in driving users’ choices, cited by 42%.</p> <p>Apple is playing catch-up to Android handset makers, which began offering larger screens years ago in response to strong demand in Asia, as well as to differentiate themselves from Apple. That gave them some crucial leverage: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/07/apple-smartphone-samsung-patent-trial-iphone\">an internal presentation from Apple, presented as evidence by Samsung in a trial over patents</a>, showed executives concerned in April 2013 that “consumers want what we don’t have” – larger-screened phones. </p> <p>Jana, which surveys consumers in Africa and Asia, <a href=\"http://www.jana.com/assets/Big-Screen-Infographic.png\">points out</a> that since 2007 the average size of a smartphone screen has grown from 2.6in to 4.86in. </p> <p>But for Apple’s slow approach to introducing a larger screen, that average would be larger; Apple shipped 13.5% of all smartphones in the first half of 2014, and most were 4in, with a significant proportion being the older iPhone 4 and 4S, with 3.5in screens. (BlackBerry, which still offers 3in screens on older BB7 phones, was 0.4% of smartphone shipments in the first half of the year.) </p> <p>Bigger is preferred. Over half the respondents in a recent survey in emerging economies including Kenya and Vietnam expected their next smartphone to have a screen over 5in.</p> <p>Samsung in particular has a powerful position in the so-called “phablet” (phone-tablet) market, defined variously as phones with screens over 5in or 5.5in (the precise definition varies between research companies). From the first Galaxy Note, introduced in 2011 with a then-gigantic 5.3in screen, to the latest Galaxy Note 4, with a 5.7in screen, Samsung has dominated the space, with an estimated 14% of the installed base of the rapidly growing segment.<br /></p> <p>Samsung intends to retain that status despite challenges from China’s Huawei and Xiaomi: <a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2014/09/419_164168.html\">speaking</a> at IFA last week, the executive vice-president of its mobile business, Lee Young-hee, said: “We have both the originality and leadership in the global market’s high-end segment for large-screened smartphones, though many other smartphone manufacturers, including Apple, are increasingly looking into this segment … With our long-accumulated experience and know-how in related technologies such as multi-tasking control and digital pen-writing, I believe we can maintain our leadership.”</p> <p>For Samsung, that could be crucial: profits at its electronics division dipped in the second quarter, along with smartphone shipments, and Apple’s entrance into this space will test brand loyalty.</p> <p>Phablets will become an increasingly important part of the phone market, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC). In a <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25077914\">forecast this month</a> it says that this year more phablets will be sold than laptop computers worldwide, 175m against 170m – and that in 2015, the number will hit 318m, outdistancing 233m tablets. (IDC defines a phablet as a phone with a screen between 5.5in and 7in.)</p> <p>In the context of the smartphone market, which is expected to hit 1.2bn this year, 5.5in+ “phablets” will be just under 15% of shipments. But more and more phones have screens larger than 5in, an alternative definition of “phablet”.</p> <p>For Apple, which sees China as a gigantic market to be tapped, larger-screened phones are certain to drive many extra sales, even over the number it already has: China is reckoned to have around 120m iPhone users – making it the the largest – more than the US, which has about 74m <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Reports-July-2014-US-Smartphone-Subscriber-Market-Share\">according to data from July from ComScore</a>.</p> <p>The biggest point in Apple’s favour, though, is that it can use its larger-screened phones to appeal to two groups: existing iPhone customers wanting something bigger and users of Android phones whose key consideration is screen size. <br /></p> <p><strong>• Charles Arthur’s travel and accommodation was paid for by Apple. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/info/guardian-editorial-code\"><strong>Editorial is completely independent</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/9/1410292985929/0b7f5f08-d19c-4f2e-ae9d-2f351df0cfb0-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/09/bigger-iphone-battle-android-samsung-apple-iphone-6-phablet","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/sep/09/bigger-iphone-battle-android-samsung-apple-iphone-6-phablet","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"GNM sustainability report 2014: editorial","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-09T07:30:00Z","sectionId":"sustainability","id":"sustainability/sustainability-report-2014-editorial","fields":{"body":"<p>At the 2014 <a href=\"http://www.pressawards.org.uk/\">UK Press Awards</a>, the Oscars of the newspaper industry, the Guardian was named newspaper of the year for its reporting of government surveillance, based on leaks from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\">NSA</a> whistleblower, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>, first published in the summer of 2013.</p><p>On a night when a plethora of Guardian and Observer journalists were honoured individually, the judges said the paper 'broke a story of global significance that went to the heart of the debate on press freedom…the job of a newspaper is to speak truth to power and the past year has seen the Guardian do this with will and verve'.</p><p>That determination to speak truth to power was also acknowledged a few weeks later, when the Guardian, along with the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/\">Washington Post</a>, was awarded the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/14/guardian-washington-post-pulitzer-nsa-revelations\">Pulitzer prize for public service</a>, the highest accolade in US journalism. This time, the judges said the paper's aggressive reporting had 'helped to spark a debate about the relationship between the government and the public over the issues of security and privacy'.</p><p>The debate continues to rage and while the NSA revelations have, to put it mildly, ruffled the feathers of governments and commentators around the world, they have only served to bolster the reputation of the Guardian as a trusted media brand: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-report-2014-readers-survey\">our latest survey of readers</a> told us 87% of those who took part believe our news is trustworthy.</p><h2>Campaigning journalism</h2><p>The past year has also seen the Guardian adopt a new model of campaigning journalism with the launch, in February, of the Guardian's worldwide end <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/end-fgm\">female genital mutilation (FGM) media campaign</a>, led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/maggieokane\">Maggie O'Kane</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mary-carson\">Mary Carson</a> from the paper's multimedia investigations team.</p><p>It is estimated that 6,000 girls daily are mutilated by FGM and the aim of the campaign is to use the tools of mass media and relationships with grassroots organisations to end the practice of FGM as quickly as possible.</p><p>Working with other British campaign groups and international campaign platform <a href=\"https://www.change.org/\">change.org</a>, the Guardian called on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\">Michael Gove</a>, Minister for Education at the time, to write to all schools in the UK, asking head teachers to take whatever action necessary to protect the children in their schools.</p><p>A young woman from Bristol, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/05/british-girl-guardian-campaign-end-female-genital-mutilation-fgm\">Fahma Mohammed, was the face of the Guardian's campaign</a> and drove a petition that collected nearly 250,000 signatures in just over 20 days. The UN Secretary General <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ban-ki-moon\">Ban Ki moon</a> joined the campaign, calling on media around the world to support an international drive to end the practice. A month later, not only had Mr Gove agreed to write to all schools, but the Welsh and Scottish Education ministers agreed to do the same. </p><p>The campaign moved to the US where, inspired by what she had seen in Britain, a young woman from Atlanta called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/12/jaha-dukureh-washington-female-genital-mutilation\">Jaha Dukereh</a> started her own petition with change.org and the Guardian. She called on President Obama to order a national survey into the prevalence of FGM in the US. The US petition is now approaching 250,000 signatures and prominent congressmen have joined the campaign. The scale and success of the US and British campaigns have led to a <a href=\"http://human-dignity-foundation.org/\">Human Dignity Foundation</a> grant of $1m dollars to take the fight to Africa. The work in Kenya, once again with campaign platform <a href=\"https://www.change.org/\">change.org</a>, is now well underway.</p><h2>Guardian Australia</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/au\">Guardian Australia</a> marked its first birthday at the end of May 2014 and there was much to celebrate. Having launched in what can truly be described as \"interesting times\", certainly in terms of the politics of the country, the website managed to break story after story, almost from day one. One of its biggest scoops so far was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/julia-gillard-labor-purpose-future?view=classic\">5,000 word essay</a>, written last September for the website by deposed prime minister, Julia Gillard, in which she finally broke her silence after last year's general election. Gillard is now a regular columnist for the website.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australian-immigration-and-asylum\">Asylum and immigration</a> have been areas of particular focus for the reporting team: each year, thousands of asylum seekers making their way to Australia on boats are intercepted and detained in camps on islands in territories belonging to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/papua-new-guinea\">Papua New Guinea</a> (PNG). Once interred, there is no possibility of them ever settling in Australia and they are not legally entitled to settle in PNG either. This leaves them with a choice of remaining in limbo or returning home.</p><p>On 17 February 2014, violence broke out in the detention centre on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/manus-island\">Manus Island</a>, following protests about the poor conditions there. One asylum seeker, Iranian architecture student <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/reza-barati\">Reza Barati</a>, was killed and several other people were injured. Guardian Australia broke the story and obtained footage shot inside the centre, which helped to confirm that the disturbances has started inside the centre, not outside as was initially reported.</p><p>The unrest at Manus Island has been the subject of three separate inquiries since February. It has also had several documentary treatments and all of them have referred to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/interactive/2014/feb/28/manus-island-riot-timeline\">interactive timeline</a> generated by Guardian Australia, which charts what happened on the night of 17 February. The timeline is updated, as new information becomes available, and has become the definitive reference document about the event.</p><h2>Innovation</h2><p>There was success this year with another Australian interactive: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family\">Firestorm</a> is a groundbreaking multimedia project that told the story behind one of the most arresting images of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/jan/05/tasmania-bushfires-in-pictures\">2013 Tasmanian bushfires</a> – the Holmes family clinging to a jetty to survive the devastation. Categorised as an online experience, Firestorm blends long form writing, video documentary, audio material and interactive elements. The piece won the prize for multimedia story telling at the <a href=\"http://walkleys.com/\">2014 Walkley awards</a>, which celebrate the best in Australian journalism. We also brought the reality of surveillance to life in a compelling interactive feature: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\">NSA Files – Decoded</a>.</p><p>In print, we added to our selection of supplements with the launch of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/jan/11/do-something\">Do Something</a> in January. Free with the Saturday Guardian, Do Something is a guide to stretching your horizons, learning new skills and generally making the most of life, without breaking the bank. In September 2013, Observer readers were introduced to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/jul/13/observer-tech-monthly\">Observer Tech Monthly</a>, which brings together news and developments from the world of science and technology and includes a wide-ranging selection of opinions, debates and interviews.</p><p>We have recently relaunched our app, with a new responsive design that is compatible with smartphones and tablets for the first time, giving users a more personalised and engaging experience.

Throughout 2014-15, we will continue to innovate and find even more compelling ways in which people can access and enjoy our award-winning journalism. </p><h2>Record breakers</h2><p>In April, the Guardian reached a significant milestone, passing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/guardian-reaches-over-100-million-unique-browsers\">100 million monthly unique browsers</a> mark for the first time, according to figures released by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/17/guardian-website-100-million-users-abc\">ABC (Audit Bureau of Circulations).</a></p><p>The Guardian first explored online journalism almost 20 years ago, when our technology writers created an online hub for technology news and called it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/dec/16/guardian-technology-section\">Go2</a>. Then, in 1999, the full website, Guardian Unlimited, was revealed and later re-launched as guardian.co.uk in 2008.</p><p>In 2013, the Guardian moved to a global domain, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk\">theguardian.com</a>, to reflect a growing international audience (almost two-thirds of our audience live outside the UK).

Literacy is a fundamental right for women. In 2010, Irina Bokova, director-general of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco), <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35859#.U5WPLl5N3wI\" title=\"\">said that</a> \"newly literate women have a positive ripple effect on all development indicators\". This broadens the issue significantly beyond education alone.</p><p>\"On its own, literacy neither saves lives nor fills hungry mouths,\" says Katy Newell-Jones of <a href=\"http://www.feedtheminds.org/\" title=\"\">Feed the Minds</a>. \"However, we encounter women's literacy time and time again as a valuable component in women's empowerment. A woman who is able to keep her own business records is more likely to be able to manage her income and expenditure; and the children of a literate mother are more likely to complete their education.\"</p><p>Literate women are also more able to mitigate some of the root causes of maternal and child morbidity and mortality. Further, <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/training/programmes/Instructor%20Version/Part_2/Activities/Human_Societies/Agriculture/Supplemental/Women-Farmers_Productivity_in_Sub_Saharan_Africa.pdf\" title=\"\">women's productivity</a> in the informal sector in countries across sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia remains the cornerstone of regional economic systems and food security, making improved learning outcomes integral to reducing poverty and harnessing all aspects of a country's economic potential.</p><p>A woman's ability is also increasingly dependent on the written word in a technology driven world where smartphones are ubiquitous, and illiteracy limits her <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/fatimah-kelleher/future-is-%E2%80%98smart%E2%80%99-but-is-it-equal-african-women%E2%80%99s-digital-agency\" title=\"\">to only basic levels of engagement</a>.</p><p>So where and how wide is the gap?  The <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/events/global-monitoring-report-20132014-implications-renewed-agenda-teachers-and-quality-education\" title=\"\">2013/14 Education For All Global Monitoring report</a> highlights that despite gains since 1998, more than 60% of adult women in Arab states, south and west Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa are still illiterate. A closer look at national data shows cause for greater concern. In Mali, women's adult literacy by 2015 is projected to be only 29%, with women's youth literacy at 45%.</p><p>Compounding such data is concern over underestimation of the problem. Global statistics use national surveys and censuses that ask whether respondents have been to school. But <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001907/190771e.pdf\" title=\"\">increased access to education through higher enrolment rates can underplay high dropout among children</a> before they are literate. Even completion of basic education is no guarantee, due to the <a href=\"http://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/why-quality-universal-primary-education-risk\" title=\"\">ongoing struggle for quality within education</a> among countries that have accelerated their educational programming to meet the <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/en/education-for-all-international-coordination/themes/efa-goals/\" title=\"\">Education for All</a> and <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\" title=\"\">millennium development goals</a> over the past 15 years.</p><p>But for millions of girls on the cusp of youth followed by rapid adulthood, addressing challenges within formal systems will not be easy. Domestic responsibilities, new roles as wives and mothers, coupled with increasing economic productivity, makes 'time poverty' an even greater challenge to their learning options. Traditional views on women's education along with issues of distance and security in reaching adult learning centres underpin the challenges.</p><p>There is a clear need therefore to approach this problem in a holistic manner, as outlined by a <a href=\"http://www.niace.org.uk/sites/default/files/project-docs/womensrighttoliteracy_web_0.pdf\" title=\"\">National Institute of Adult Continuing Education report</a> on women's right to literacy: \"Literacy learning is particularly effective when it is linked to, integrated with or embedded in other learning. Such approaches produce stronger outcomes in both literacy and vocational education and training. Women who want to be successful traders, efficient farmers, contribute to school governance and rear healthy children must be equipped with the necessary, associated literacy skills.\"</p><p>Critical to this \"second chance\" approach is ensuring women are involved in the co-designing, development, implementation and evaluation of their learning programmes and activities. Approaches such as <a href=\"http://www.reflect-action.org\" title=\"\">Reflect</a> that use <a href=\"http://www.reflect-action.org/how\" title=\"\">participatory methodologies</a> are already popular since the 1990s and are now widely used to empower women.  Considerations such as learning mother-tongue and sensitivity to the power relationships women have to broker in their adult contexts are critical. When such learning is placed at the heart of the community, empowerment is also more likely to emerge.</p><p>Greater investment in women's adult and youth literacy is urgently needed, while responsibility must be accepted across all sectors, not just in education. With skills training falling increasingly within economic and private sector development initiatives, integrated women's rights programming must go beyond nominal gender box ticking and instead fully utilise social and women's rights expertise to address the complex realities.

But in the developing world, and especially in the forty-eight least developed countries, such mechanisms are usually lacking. These countries are extremely poor and struggle with issues of hunger, disease and governance. Increasingly, these problems are aggravated by climate change. In the face of such challenges, weaknesses in systems for scientific advice are understandable.<br /></p> <p>Proposed solutions to these challenges are now being defined through the <a href=\"http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300\">UN’s new Sustainable Development Goals</a>. The initial draft of these goals makes clear the critical role of science in mobilising efforts to address poverty and environmental issues. But to become effectively involved in this process, the least developed countries will need to build scientific capability and strength. Ideally, each could build a corps of advanced scientists who can review and synthesize the best available information and present it to government leaders – and to their people – in clear, understandable terms. However, they cannot begin to achieve this goal without partnerships and support from the developed world to complement their own scientific culture.</p> <p>From 2001 to 2009, I served as the <a href=\"http://www.scidev.net/global/r-d/news/rwandas-president-creates-a-new-science-ministry.html\">government minister in charge of science in Rwanda</a>. In the early 1990s, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/07/rwandan-genocide-20th-anniversary-thousands-mourn-stadium\">my country endured a civil war that culminated 20 years ago in the genocide against the Tutsi,</a> leaving at least a million people dead. In the aftermath, Rwanda’s leaders recognized early on that education – including science education – would be a pillar of recovery. With the election of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kagame\">Paul Kagame </a>to Rwanda’s presidency in 2000, <a href=\"http://www.mineduc.gov.rw/IMG/pdf/Rwanda_National_STI_Policy.pdf\">the nation embarked on a development path focused on science, technology and innovation</a>, with a particular emphasis on information and communications technology (ICT). </p> <p>Under President Kagame’s direction, the government began to pursue a holistic approach to easing poverty, improving health and increasing stability through science. In the late 1990s, Rwanda began the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UrugwiroVillage\">Urugwiro Village Dialogue</a>, which brought people together to shape the future after the genocide. This process resulted in a comprehensive <a href=\"http://www.minecofin.gov.rw/home/ministry/key-documents/rwanda-vision-2020.html\">‘Vision 2020’ policy document</a>, which was released in the same year that Kagame took office. It set the timeframe for Rwanda to have a science, technology and knowledge-led economy by 2020. After his election, the president made science a ministry-level post in the government. </p> <p>This began the country’s systematic approach to science-based recovery and development. Through a process of consultation with all sectors of the nation, including academia, civil society, business and the diaspora, Rwanda was able to establish detailed, ambitious policies for science, technology, innovation and the development of ICT.</p> <p>Throughout this process, Rwanda worked in close partnership with the scientific and development sectors of other nations and international organizations. But these relationships did not follow the old model of dependence; rather, Rwanda set goals to address its needs, and worked with partners who supported the nation in its efforts. </p> <p>For example, the process that produced our 2<a href=\"http://www.mineduc.gov.rw/IMG/pdf/Rwanda_National_STI_Policy.pdf\">005 policy on science, technology and innovation</a> included close consultation with the World Bank, the African Development Bank, UNESCO, and East African regional science and technology commissions, involving Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. The UK played a critical and constructive role in this process through the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development\">Department for International Development (DFID)</a>.</p> <p>But the relationships were personal, too. The UK’s ambassador to Rwanda, Jeremy Macadie, came to the National University of Rwanda for the final meeting on our science, technology and innovation policy. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_King_(chemist)\">Sir David King</a>, then the UK’s chief scientific adviser, met with President Kagame in 2006, and addressed the two chambers of Rwanda’s Parliament on the importance of science and technology. King later became a member of Kagame’s <a href=\"http://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/index.php?action=Search&amp;search=sir+david+king&amp;search_type=site&amp;t=Search+results&amp;send=search\">Presidential Advisory Council (PAC)</a>. </p> <p>We also built a relationship with the UK’s Royal Society, out of a belief that it could be an advocate for science investment in developing countries. President Kagame <a href=\"http://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/index.php?action=Search&amp;search=sir+david+king&amp;search_type=site&amp;t=Search+results&amp;send=search\">was invited to speak at the Royal Society in 2006</a>. And the Rwandan government made a similar effort to build lasting partnerships with the United States, particularly the <a href=\"http://www.aaas.org/news/aaas-delegation-visits-rwanda-talks-east-africa-science-and-education-cooperation\">American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)</a>, USAID, and some of the best US research universities.</p> <p>These international initiatives generated a number of substantive projects. Working closely with DFID and Sir David King, we developed a <a href=\"http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&amp;type=1006&amp;menu=1348&amp;nr=2253\">national strategy for climate change and low carbon development</a>. <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/rwanda/\">Carnegie Mellon University opened a campus in Rwanda</a>, and the Italy-based Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics also plans to open a branch. <a href=\"http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/rwandan-president-paul-kagame-visits-mit\">With MIT, Rwanda is establishing a Global Climate Observatory on the summit of Mount Karisimbi</a>.</p> <p>To be sure, Rwanda today faces serious ongoing challenges. It remains a very poor country. But its economic growth has averaged 7% to 8% in recent years. Rwandans today are better educated and healthier than at any time in history. Its university enrolment is near 80,000, compared to 3,000 before the genocide. Well over half of Rwandans now have mobile phones.</p> <p>Rwanda is proof that even the poorest nations, faced with the most profound challenges, can build a future based on science. But without strong partners and good friends, this would not be possible.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://romainmurenzi.blogspot.co.uk/\">Romain Murenzi </a>is the executive director of TWAS (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TWASNews\">@TWASNews</a>), the academy of sciences for the developing world, and served as Rwanda’s minister of science and technology from 2001 to 2009.

An increasing number of NGOs, donors and governments have started to integrate mobile phones into their nutrition programmes. Unicef, for example, recently used mobile phones <a href=\"http://www.childcount.org/reports/ChildCount_Kenya_InitialReport.pdf\" title=\"\">for nutrition surveillance in Kenya (pdf)</a> by getting community health workers to send data about children’s heights and weights via text message.</p> <p>In light of this, <a href=\"http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/4096/ER79%20A%20Mixed-Method%20Impact%20Evaluation%20Design%20of%20a%20Mobile%20Phone%20Application%20for%20Nutrition%20Service%20Delivery%20in%20Indonesia.pdf?sequence=3\" title=\"\">a new study</a> carried out by the <a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Institute of Development Studies (IDS)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wvi.org/indonesia\" title=\"\">World Vision Indonesia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.worldvision.ca/\" title=\"\">World Vision Canada</a> calls for the need to properly assess the impact of using mobile phone technology to address undernutrition. We propose a design to examine the use of mobile phones in Indonesia’s nutrition service delivery system.</p> <p>In Indonesia, mobile phones are used to collect data on the nutritional status of children and to deliver tailored messages to encourage healthier eating. Indonesia has one of the highest absolute numbers of undernourished children in the world. The country has more than 7.5 million children below the age of five too short for their age (stunted) and 2.8 million children too thin for their height, according to <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/Nutrition_Report_final_lo_res_8_April.pdf\" title=\"\">Unicef’s 2013 report on improving child nutrition</a>.</p> <p>There is an urgent need to develop new tools and mechanisms to respond to the challenge of child undernutrition. But can the current enthusiasm for mobile phone technology deliver?</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/using-mobile-phones-for-nutrition-surveillance-a-review-of-evidence\" title=\"\">recent review</a> found there are few studies that have critically assessed the success of mobile phones in addressing undernutrition. No study could be found that looked at what happened to mobile-phone-based nutrition programmes after the initial introduction. The review suggests that mobile phones may make tracking and monitoring of nutrition more timely and efficient. For example by speeding up data entry and transfer, and reducing errors. However, it is still unknown whether and under what conditions this “real-time” nutrition data can be used to trigger rapid response to crises and inform better decision-making.</p> <p>Another shortcoming is that most nutrition programmes using mobile phones are small one-off pilot projects with limited or no integration into national nutrition strategies. In several studies mobile-phone systems were created in parallel to existing non-tech approaches, therefore duplicating efforts. Sustainability and opportunities for scale-up were consequently low as in-country ownership and actual need were often very limited. Consequently, most projects ceased to exist after the initial pilot.</p> <p>Furthermore, even if such projects do continue after implementation, it cannot be assumed that incorporating mobile phone technology has a positive effect. There are key questions that should be asked. For example, does mobile phone technology improve data quality and timeliness in nutrition monitoring at the community level? Will it contribute to effective decision making by donors and governments? And if so, would quicker data lead to quicker action against undernutrition on the ground?</p> <p>At the core is the need to understand the context of where projects are being implemented. Reliable network coverage, stable access to electricity, available capacity and budget, acceptance of technology and the dynamics of domestic decision-making processes are all factors which influence mobile phones being an effective tool against undernutrition.</p> <p>Despite the fact that in other spheres it is widely acknowledged that understanding the context and not applying a one-size fits all approach, it seems to have to a large extent bypassed the mobile revolution. In the context of mobile-phone-based projects this is probably one of the main reasons why many don’t continue after the pilot. Projects are still often driven by technology experts and context, and country-specific needs are only marginally considered.</p> <p>There is a clear need for a better understanding of how context affects mobile phone technology for nutrition service delivery. This is essential to develop successful programmes in different settings. A one-size-fits-all approach to the design of mobile phone-based nutrition programmes and systems is unlikely to be effective.</p> <p>A critical and rigorous assessment of the impact of mobile phones on nutrition service delivery is long overdue. A study is needed so that this technology can reach its full potential to contribute to improving nutrition around the world.</p> <p><em>Inka Barnett is a research fellow at the </em><a href=\"https://www.ids.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Institute of Development Studies</em></a><em>.

India has 600,000 villages, of which <a href=\"http://www.slbcbihar.com/DOCUMENTS/DRAFT_FINANCIAL_INCLUSION_PLAN.PDF\">only 74,000 have access to banks</a>. Financial inclusion efforts by the government focus on trying to increase the number of brick-and-mortar banks, creating a <a href=\"http://rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?UrlPage=&amp;ID=733\">massive network</a> of banking correspondents to target rural areas, and installing more ATM branches – one within <a href=\"http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-01-16/news/46264332_1_financial-inclusion-nachiket-mor-bank-account\">15 minutes walking distance</a> of every Indian by January 2016.</p> <p>Yet, these stats fail to account for the country’s massive unbanked population that utilise informal financial services, notably mobile money.</p> <p>Traditional banking is challenging for low-income populations for several reasons. Some struggle with filling out forms, given limited literacy levels. Others simply distrust the financial institutions with their meagre savings. Most low-income families operate in a cash-based society. They prefer to store their cash where it’s easily accessible. They don’t see value in opening a bank account, only to store a small amount of money. Plus, banks have numerous formalities, fees, and documentation that can be intimidating and require a trek to a local branch, which can compromise a day’s wages.</p> <p>In 2005, the Indian government tried to attract citizens by offering <a href=\"http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/BC35100812SF.pdf\">‘no frills’ bank accounts</a> with no monthly costs and zero (or very little) minimum balance required. Thousands signed up. Few actually used the bank accounts, leaving the majority of them <a href=\"http://www.microsave.net/files/pdf/Exploring_Reasons_for_Dormancy_in_No_Frills_Savings_Accounts_In_Tamil_Nadu.pdf\">dormant</a>.</p> <p>In a country so vast, having a physical structure in place – be it through ATMs, banking correspondents, or brick-and-mortar branches – seems difficult. Consequently mobile money platforms are catching on.</p> <p>Delhi-based <a href=\"https://b2b.beam.co.in/\">Beam</a> is one alternative to the old-school bank. At a ‘mom-and-pop’ shop, commonly referred to as kirana stores, a Beam agent, the shopkeeper, helps a customer pay his bills, buy a railway ticket, and remit money to his relatives in his ancestral village using his mobile phone. With transaction costs for remittances being lower than at a bank (0.5% versus 2.0% respectively), Beam customers often choose not to have bank accounts.</p> <p>Beam gives customers similar services to a bank: they can store cash for payments, pay utility bills electronically, send money home, top up a pay-as-you-go mobile phone, pay TV and wi-fi charges, and purchase any necessary travel tickets – without the hassle of opening a bank account, providing paperwork, and needing to do it in person.</p> <p>An expansive network of mom-and-pop shops facilitate payments, making it accessible to low-income families who may struggle with technology. For customers with smartphones (which are now as cheap as 4,000Rs in India), Beam also has an app.</p> <p>Given that Beam is connected to their mobile, is cheap, straightforward, and instantaneous, mobile money seems like a better option. Beam is also telco-agnostic, meaning that it can operate on any telecomm provider; it’s not a mobile wallet product of a specific company, such as Vodafone or Airtel.</p> <p>Yet, Beam has its setbacks. It can’t offer savings packages, loans, insurance, or credit. Beam holds its customers’ money in escrow at a bank and its CEO, Anand Shrivastav, admits the company has had to spend considerable amounts of time, building public trust, making sure customers felt their money was secure in a Beam account. As it expands, Beam will need a larger force of agents, educated and savvy enough to carry out its business in the heartland of India. For mobile money to become in India what it has been in Kenya, Beam and providers will have to work with the RBI to change the legal and regulatory framework that has <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/05/28/mobile-money-kenya-good-india-bad/\">limited the expansion of mobile money on the subcontinent</a> to date. </p> <p>Still, these are interesting times for financial inclusion in India, and subsequently, for the country’s economy. More access to formal financial services will encourage savings and investment. But for the effort that will take to ensure billions of Indians are no longer unbanked, it would seem wise, prudent even, to simultaneously develop the infrastructure that will also facilitate mobile banking.</p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong><br /></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/18/mobile-payment-utilitlies-east-africa\">Using mobile money to buy water and solar power in east Africa</a><br /></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/blog/2014/aug/18/econet-wireless-zimbabwe-cashless-society\">Zimbabwe’s Econet Wireless and the making of Africa’s first cashless society</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/18/-sp-fewest-atms-interactive-map\">Interactive map: which country has the fewest ATMs?</a></p> <p>• Advertisement feature: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/visa-partner-zone/10-things-you-need-to-know-mobile-money\">10 things you need to know about mobile money</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development\"><strong>Join our community</strong></a><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

His claim is a historical one, based on <a href=\"http://stevenpinker.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions-about-better-angels-our-nature-why-violence-has-declined\">much-queried</a> empirical methods, but underwriting his narrative of progress is an assessment of human nature that worries we’ll fall into anarchy without a strong state to guide us.</p> <p>Is this, rather than the idea that we’re becoming less violent, his really dangerous idea? In light of fresh anxieties about the rise of the security state and mass surveillance, it seems much more dangerous to worry over mass anarchy than the overreach of state power.</p> <p>“As I’m having this conversation with you, I’m really not worried about a drone sending a missile through my hotel window and blowing me to bits,” Pinker told me by phone in the lead up to his appearance at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas. “So I think those concerns are genuinely overblown.”</p> <p>Pinker thinks that “evolution gave us a number of motives that, left to their own devices, will result in levels of violence that we all deplore, and that it’s up to our institutions – which are products of our own ingenuity – to drive those rates of violence down.”<br /></p> <p>I put to Pinker the idea that because the state has a monopoly on violence, and wields it in increasingly asymmetrical ways (drone strikes, militarised police, mass surveillance), it’s hard for citizens to respond.</p> <p>“I don’t think that there’s much merit to those points,” Pinker said. “Because together with a more effective democratic government we have far more freedom of thought and speech than our ancestors did.</p> <p>He added: “I can say that Barack Obama is a Muslim who was born in Kenya and is like Hitler, and I don’t have to worry about being trundled off to jail or sent off to re-education camps. Whereas a few hundred years ago, before there were technologies of surveillance and mass education, there were a lot of things that could have led me to be burned at the stake.”</p> <p>Human societies are poised between the violence of anarchy, and the violence of tyranny, Pinker believes. But ”one part of human nature, namely the capacity to think up violence-reduction methods, such as governments and the rule of law, can counteract other parts of human nature such as the drive for dominance and revenge.” </p> <p> Whether or not we suppress the desire to be violent, says Pinker, “we suppress the behaviour itself.” That said, he considers the militarisation of domestic police forces to be “a preposterous development over the last 10 to 15 years, which I expect to be reversed … it has led to salient atrocities like the one we saw in Ferguson.”</p> <p>But, he insists, “by and large there’s no comparison between that and say the gulag or Maoist China, or Nazi Germany, or Medieval Europe.”</p> <p>He think that liberal-democratic systems, informed by Enlightenment ideals, have hit a kind of “sweet spot”. Democratic checks and balances combine with “a government that wields the least possible amount of violence, in order to prevent greater violence”. </p> <p>They are the most likely to self-correct too, Pinker says, because “it’s actually principles of liberal democracy that allow us to expose the crimes of our ancestors”. He refers to the politics of Martin Luther King Jr as an example of this process. </p> <p>“[King] was deliberately applying a principle that on paper the entire country had committed itself to [in the constitution], but shamefully had not applied.</p> <p>In Pinker’s view, liberal democracy is “a never-ending project, and it requires, as the cliche goes, eternal vigilance, which is the price of liberty. People in power are bound to try to abuse that power, so it’s a matter of coming up with safeguards to prevent that from happening.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-31T13:39:07.959+01:00\">at 10.39pm AEST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5402b972e4b0b881942ff9f8\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-31T07:08:49.528+01:00\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>What’s been the best-seller in the pop-up Fodi bookshop today? </strong></p> <p>Lydia Cacho’s <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846274220\">Slavery Inc: The Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking</a> apparently. </p> <p>Oh, and Rushdie.

Back then Nussbaum (who has also written an excellent piece chronicling the subversiveness of <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women\">Sex and the City</a>) would defend the show’s many artistic merits, in the face of unfair prejudice towards its more “trashy” cover elements.</p> <p>Though neither speaker really addressed the panel headline’s provocation, Rushdie did leave us with a rather cute joke: two goats are chewing on film reels in a projection room. One goat asks, “how was the film?” The other replies, “it’s OK, but not as good as the book.”</p> <p>And for the record, here is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/books/review/are-the-new-golden-age-tv-shows-the-new-novels.html?_r=0\">an excellent discussion between Adam Kirsch and Mohsin Hamid</a> that does actually address the premise.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-31T13:39:31.331+01:00\">at 10.39pm AEST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5402a3d4e4b00f184315aab7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-31T05:38:24.872+01:00\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>People, there’s a Fodi quiz.

His mother was upset, but then when she visited him in jail, she was proud of him. “It was an honour for me to be arrested with famous writers, and the greatest academics of law, humanist philosophers!” Zarakolu told this afternoon’s Fodi audience in his session, <strong>Publish and be damned</strong>.<br /></p> <p>He has been consistently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/02/turkish-publisher-arrest-ragip-zarakolu\">arrested, harassed and imprisoned</a> by the Turkish government for more than 40 years, in part because he insists on writing about the Armenian genocide in a Turkish political environment that is becoming increasingly nationalistic. <br /></p> <p>At least in Australia, he said, those who insist on a “clean history” can’t jail intellectuals. “You can talk about what happened to the Aborigines, you can discuss it,” Zarakolu said.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-74e35e87-05a1-4b1c-b82a-68d9abc2b4da\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/31/1409457882310/7a1eff06-a3a9-4188-9c44-4ace93a742c1-419x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Ragip Zarakolu\" width=\"419\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An archive photograph of Ragip Zarakolu,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HERIBERT PROEPPER/ASSOCIATED PRESS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His most recent detention was in 2011. “It was like [Franz Kafka’s novel] The Trial, because I was kidnapped out the front of my house [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/02/turkish-publisher-arrest-ragip-zarakolu\">by the anti-terrorism police</a>]. They were unknown persons, civilians, their outfit was like normal young people … our neighbours tried to save me, they thought it was a gang!”<br /></p> <p>The odd thing was that under the “civilian government in Turkey they work with the same methods” as the old generals’ regime, Zarakolu said. In the 70s dictatorship, being arrested and harassed seemed normal – but it was “abnormal” under a civilian regime.<br /></p> <p>Zarakolu wryly noted that when he visited Belfast at the invitation of the British consul during the troubles, he was there as a human rights observer, but he has had the opportunity to observe the human rights conditions in jail as a prisoner. “It’s a kind of defence mechanism, so you can say you’re morally higher – [it’s the government that is] abnormal, and this situation is abnormal. So this is also an experience.” </p> <p>“I am lucky to have this experience and I go on to express my ideas in prison also,” he said, noting that he’d published a petition calling for genocide recognition during his time in jail.<br /></p> <p>Freedom of expression is vital, Zarakolu said. “It’s a mission to struggle for freedom of expression.

There was the day she was kidnapped and then incarcerated on the orders of a corrupt police chief, and going undercover as a nun to collect stories from sex workers in some of the Mexico City’s roughest neighhoods.</p> <p>She’s busted crime rings and linked some of her country’s most powerful businessmen and politicians to child prostitution, one of whom she once confronted in court with the words: “Every time you look into my eyes every child you’ve abused will be looking back at you.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a73fa871-fe4c-46b1-967b-9b4145986059\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/31/1409455605671/0af1317e-df03-40f5-86a3-1335cfda51cf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"lydia cacho mexican journalist\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lydia Cacho photographed for the Guardian.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cacho links these individuals to a global trade of coerced sex workers and underage sex slaves that she says makes $150bn every year. Australians are connected to that system – not only as sex tourists in countries like Cambodia and Thailand – but also as consumers of pornography, of which teenage imagery and videos make up 25%.</p> <p>The journalist makes it clear that she is all for erotic, healthy love lives, nor does she believe in prostitution raids (excepting cases involving children) that pronounce someone is a victim when they are not. But the violence and misogny that proliferates in the sex industry can be changed, she says, and that change begins with men. </p> <p>Cacho then proposes her own “dangerous idea”, that we kick off a global dialogue about masculinity. “What it is to be a man, and the owner of your own body.” She says feminism has taken great strides in helping women own their own bodies and sexuality, but now it is time that men have a similar discussion, and learn to enjoy sex “not through the penis alone, but with their whole being.”</p> <p>She ends with a bold call out: “Men tell me we need more women like you. But what we need is more men like me in the world.”</p> <p><strong>Correction:</strong> This original post incorrectly referenced Carmen Aristegui as a subject of Cacho’s journalism.

There are more journalisms (sic) than ever before. There are more people fulfilling the role of the journalists than ever before [paid / amateur / ‘corporations pretending to be journalists’]. And the audience is biggest than it’s even been before.”</p> <p>Journalism(’s) alive and well then. Cats certainly don’t need saving, Peter adds, to opprobium from the audience. He also says that we need to stop talking about digital as if it happened two weeks ago. We’re two decades into this revolution – at least.</p> <p>Mark Scott agrees but adds that the most comparable revolution, the invention of the printing press, took at least 100 years to roll out. We’ll look back at 2014 and realise we were only at the very beginning. The big question, he says, is: how do we fund it? There may be more journalists than ever before (more voices, more discussion, more debate). But at journalism’s core, there are far fewer people invested (and prepared to invest) in breaking news than there used to be.</p> <p>Australia has seen a lot of recent and successful entrants into the market, says Simon Crerar. His own company Buzzfeed, the Guardian (thanks, mate), Daily Mail, and soon to arrive Huffington Post. These are forcing Australia’s sitting publishers into new ways or working thinking. </p> <p>Peter agrees: Newscorp are responding with “nimbleness”. But the fact remains: you’ve got to bring in more money that you spend, especially if you are no longer proprietor owned, but share-holder owned. A la Fairfax etc.</p> <p>Time to talk business models then. Tim Duggan of Junkee – which won Aus media brand of the year, he boasts ,“beating the Guardian” natch – does it all with only two full time editorial staff and funded by native advertising. Asked for a definition of that slippery beast, he gives one: “quality content, inspired by brands, delivered in-thread so that it looks like everything else we feed through.” He gives an example of a juicy 5000-word travel read for the youth brand Contiki that will launch next week.</p> <p>All well and good, say Peter Fray, but who is going to pay for Kate McClymont to write 5000 words from ICAC? Journalism exists to seek truth and seeking truth is a very expensive thing, he says. Native advertising is not going to deliver that, at least not at the Australian where digital subscriptions are going up (here comes the push for the paywall), but 90 cents in the dollar still comes from print revenue.<br /></p> <p>Mark Scott chips in: “is that a print success story of a digital weakness story?” And another question: if print’s days are numbered, how big a newsroom could digital-only revenue fund?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://news.vice.com/video/the-islamic-state-part-1\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bsCZzpmbEcs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Vice’s Islamic State video.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There’s more chat about Buzzfeed and Junkee’s business models from Simon and Tim, talk of the global news brands (New York Times, Daily Mail, the Guardian) who are building on strong home bases with local offices around the world, and a surprising amount of optimism about Australian journalism’s future. And a big shout out from Simon for Vice’s embedded Islamic state video series.</p> <p>This final thought from Peter interesting: “The one thing we don’t do enough of in this county is open the door and let the reader in. We journalists need to appreciate their opinion, not see it as the threat we first see it as. It’s a great opportunity, a once in a lifetime opportunity in my case. I’m buzzed up on that.” </p> <p>See Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger on “open journalism” here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2012/feb/29/alan-rusbridger-open-journalism-guardian-video\"                                                data-video-id=\"1710869\"                data-video-name=\"Alan Rusbridger on open journalism at the Guardian: 'Journalists are not the only experts in the world' - video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-386687693\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/poster/2012/2/29/120229OpenAlanRusbridger_5879430.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/3/131002AlanRusbridger-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/3/131002AlanRusbridger_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/3/131002AlanRusbridger_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/2/29/120229OpenAlanRusbridger-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/3/131002AlanRusbridger/131002AlanRusbridger.m3u8\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Finally, some great questions – one could even say dangerous ideas – from the floor: </p> <p>• Is the thing that needs saving actually advertising?<br />• Is there room for a model for a totally crowdfunded site that isn’t just a feed for ideas but a source of information?

The Swedish author Kajsa Ekis Ekman says it will be the equivalent of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/us/baby-m-and-the-question-of-surrogate-motherhood.html?_r=0\">Baby M case</a>, a watershed moment for surrogacy in the US. </p> <p>Ekman says surrogacy is a “perverse sort of market”, the reverse side of the coin to prostitution. “These two industries both commodify the female body in different ways,” in that prostitution is sex without reproduction – the client of a pregnant sex worker will not expect to be responsible for any child resulting from intercourse – and surrogacy is reproduction without sex, because nobody has sex to procreate the surrogate child. </p> <p>In what was one of the more provocative Fodi talks today, Ekman said this was so a male buyer can remain faithful to his wife, who may be infertile, and so a male homosexual couple may “keep their gayness intact while fathering a child”.</p> <p>Prostitution and surrogacy embody the two archetypal forms of female subjugation, Ekman says, the whore and the self-sacrifical Madonna. Both of these “require women to renounce their own interests”, and instead engage with their bodies on the terms of a buyer. In the case of prostitution, “it’s not about her orgasm, it’s about his desire”, and for surrogacy, it’s about the buyer’s desire to possess the child – which leads Ekman to describe surrogacy as “baby trafficking”.</p> <p>She disagrees with other ethical conceptions of surrogacy. Are those who procure surrogates merely paying for the “service” of the pregnancy? Or are they paying for the child, but not reducing the child itself to a kind of property? Ekman doesn’t find these arguments convincing – “what is being sold is very tangible: it’s a newborn baby”.</p> <p>Ekman explained that surrogacy began in the US during the 1970s, after abortion was legalised. Because there was a marked decline in the number of newborns being put up for adoption, infertile, middle class couples turned to international adoption – but many white couples didn’t want a baby who looked racially different to them. This led to a search for paid surrogates in the US and the emergence of agencies who could link up surrogates with prospective buyers.</p> <p>The development of embryo implants allowed this dynamic to change, and expanded the market for surrogates overseas to developing countries like Thailand and India. A white couple could employ an Indian or Thai surrogate in the knowledge that their child would still be white.</p> <p>Ekman points to kidnappings and “surrogacy brothels” in the developing world, and exploitation through contracts, as examples of what happens when surrogacy becomes a market. She rejects the idea that paying surrogates changes the moral equation, saying “to me that’s the most cynical argument you could ever use”.</p> <p>The problem, she says, is that surrogacy puts the woman through what the Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukács calls “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification\">reification</a>” – which she explained was “when you commodify a part of human life itself”. Pregnancy itself becomes “functionalised” – turned into something that is “separate for the woman, as if she’s ‘a bun in the oven’ … a container – as if she doesn’t have feelings for the child.”</p> <p>Consequently, surrogate mothers domestically and overseas are trained in ways to dissociate themselves from the baby they’re carrying. They “never to refer to the child as ‘my baby’, or refer to themselves as mothers,” Ekman said. Even “surrogate mother” is frowned upon as a term, with “surrogate” or even “surro” preferred, especially in the US. </p> <p>This is what Ekman calls the “split self”, which she says also operates in sex work: “you shut off, you’re not there 100%. When you’re with a buyer, you don’t feel – you have a number of strategies.” </p> <p>For this reason, she also disapproved of “altruistic” surrogacy, where a surrogate mother doesn’t sell her services, but assists a family member, or even a stranger. She also spoke about cases in the US of surrogate children, now in adulthood, who were disappointed when finding about their origins. </p> <p>During questions, Ekman rejected the idea that prohibiting surrogacy would create a black market. “I would say it’s a big myth generally – there’s always a black market under legal industries too,” she said, noting the social censure that came about after Sweden criminalised the clients of sex workers. She sees surrogacy as different from organ donation, adoption and other types of technology-assisted fertility because of the centrality of the experience of pregnancy.</p> <p>Ekman also responded during questions to Wendy Joy Francis of the Australian Christian Lobby about the baby Gammy case and the complications that can come about through risks to the mother, or the possibility of giving birth to a disabled child. “When you’re not carrying the baby yourself, it’s a lot easier to say ‘let’s just cancel this’,” she said. “You want the perfect product, if i’m being a bit cynical.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-30T10:10:20.604+01:00\">at 7.10pm AEST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-540176b4e4b0adfd01f73b3a\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-30T08:06:51.484+01:00\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pussy Riot draw parallels between Russia and Australia</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Monica writes:</strong> Two of the festivals biggest drawcards Pussy Riot’s Nadezhda (Nadya) Tolokonnikova and Maria (Masha) Alekhina began their panel <strong>Russia is a Penal Colony</strong> by acknowledging the elephant in the room: the proposed festival boycott made by Australian activists.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c0d68f5c-3fa6-4b4d-8a12-afd724cd2e19\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/30/1409382373407/194eaeb8-7b29-4c76-a804-ed2c570e1504-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pussy Riot at FODI Sydney August 2014 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alekhina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boud</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alekhina said they were both surprised to learn about the accusations these activists are making – that the festival organisers St James Ethics Centre have inappropriate links to the Australian government’s policy Operation Sovereign Borders, which involves the mandatory detention of certain asylum seekers.</p> <p>We learned that last night the feminist punk artists met up with activists, and spoke at length to them, to attempt to understand the situation.

Those with a “fair dinkum” clinical depressive disorder respond well to medication at rates of about 80%, which he says “about as good as anything in medicine”.</p> <p>But how can they tell if you’re clinically depressed? One questioner, who herself had been prescribed anti-depressants and had a good experience with them, wondered how people are diagnosed.</p> <p><strong>Gordon Parker</strong> says there is no benchmark test, but “in fact, in medicine there are many exemplars that represent that story. Parkinsons has no benchmark test, no laboratory test”. For biological depression, he says, “they lose the life in their eyes, the resonance in their voice” and those signs can be identified by a clinician. So you need careful and sophisticated ways to approach diagnosis of depression, he says, but “we need to get away from this dumb American model of subtyping depression.”</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-30T06:51:53.651+01:00\">at 3.51pm AEST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-54015f87e4b0adfd01f73b30\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-30T06:27:14.434+01:00\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What are some practical things we can do? host Ann Mossop asks.</p> <p><strong>Gordon Parker</strong>: How can we improve our socialisation?

Relationships on social media are artificial, shallow and often banal – “These are not real relationships.”</p> <p>Talking about isolation, Parker gives the example of China, where rates of depression have gone up as society has become more individualistic and less concerned with what he says are traditional Chinese ideas of collective culture, destiny and fate – that “there’s something bigger than you”. </p> <p>That should bring us to talk about happiness and wellbeing, and the difference between them. “If we look at rates of wellbeing over the last few decades they have not increased, but have actually decreased,” Parker says, “especially for women, because of the competing demands placed upon them.”</p> <p>We have increasingly been convinced that we should “chase happiness” (the audience gave a satisfied hmmmmmmm at this point) instead of wellbeing, which is different. What it’s not, Parker says, is materialistic and concerned with amassing products. “That materialistic pursuit is counterproductive – you cannot chase wellbeing, it’s a journey that should be engaged in. Our senses are quickly sated by material things.”</p> <p>What’s more important is to be “well socialised, to find a higher meaning in life than oneself.” He quotes from an ancient Egyptian inscription on tombs: “Did you have joy in your life, and did you give joy in your life.” More hmmmmms.</p> <p><strong>Anne Manne</strong> describes social media relationships as “thin”. “People are seeing themselves liked or not liked, or how many, and counting. This is a very shaming experience for some people,” Manne says. <br /></p> <p>She says that everyone agrees that materialism above a certain level of wealth becomes meaningless as far as wellbeing is concerned. She adds that a culture of busy-ness is also a contributing factor.</p> <p>“If you are a busy person then you are one of those for whom time is money. We’re all starting to inhabit the world of the 1950s businessman ... as we rush past each other we are not seeing each other, we’re not stopping,” Manne says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-54015882e4b04891b50bc5d0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-30T06:03:51.316+01:00\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>David Baker</strong> from the Australia institute says that being alone isn’t the same thing as being lonely – so we shouldn’t discount that people who live on their own are more likely to report higher levels of loneliness.</p> <p>There are also demographic factors around males and females. For women with children, support networks around them might help mitigate the likelihood of feeling alone, because there are support networks they can draw upon, he says.</p> <p>For men with kids who might be used to regular golf trips or sessions at the pubs, “if there’s an increase in the demands on them at home, the possibilities for social interactions go down”.</p> <p>Even if you’re around kids, Baker says, “adult conversation is still adult conversation – if you’ve got kids or you’re living on your own, you might be just as isolated”. </p> <p>This drew a few laughs from the audience – perhaps there are a few parents here.<br /></p> <p><strong>Anne Manne</strong> builds on this point, saying that our relationships with our children are the deepest we have, but they also change us. She quotes Freud, who said “love makes us humble”. We “pawn” part of our narcissism when we fall in love or have a baby, Manne thinks.</p> <p>She says one of the issues in our society is a “free market of love … a free market of bodies you might say”. You can move from partner to partner, but in “each one of those endings, there’s loss”.</p> <p>There’s a greater and greater anxiety that there will be nothing to replace the last relationship, Manne says, mentioning a teacher she knew whose relationship ended.</p> <p>“She described this experience when she came home, after holding it together for her classes, and sinking into the living room in darkness, then falling onto her knees and collapsing. She did this every night.” It was a crisis of meaning for her, Manne says.</p> <p>Anne wants to know how about the “vulnerable underbelly” of the “serial relationship pattern, the “uncommitted relationship pattern”. She has also known men to become depressed after the birth of a child because of the mother’s attachment to a baby – can they deal with that loss?</p> <p>On narcissism: a therapist asked Manne about people “landing on his couch” claiming they were depressed, but he found that they had been the “victim of a narcissist”. “They’ve been on the receiving end of an arsehole”, Manne quipped. <br /></p> <p>Therapy – not just clinical therapy or psychiatry – should be more widely funded, she believes, basically as a kind of organised “mothering” and “nurturing”.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-30T06:37:49.608+01:00\">at 3.37pm AEST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5401569de4b0adfd01f73b2d\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-30T05:50:17.067+01:00\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Depression: is it the price of modern life?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a602cd39-b8ce-42a5-8406-fb551618dd53\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/30/1409374172875/2bf7c9a7-bca0-479d-a543-6c10fc68a93c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Valium pill\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We ‘really don’t know how to define it … there’s no pristine definition’ of depression.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Adam writes</strong>: Up now is a panel debate – The price of modern life is depression and loneliness. Heavy stuff!</p> <p>Speaking are <strong>Anne Manne</strong>, who’s just written a book on narcissism, <strong>David Baker</strong> from the Australia institute, and Professor <strong>Gordon Parker</strong>, from the University of NSW.</p> <p><strong>Gordon Parker</strong> kicks it off.</p> <p>“Depression is an encompassing word,” he says. We all feel despondent, which is normal, but there’s also clinical depression. Rates of reported depression are going higher and higher, he says, but he’s not convinced that rates of clinical impression are increasing. The rates of what we now call “melancholic depression” have been pretty similar over the centuries, Parker insists. </p> <p>In relation to clinical depression, we “really don’t know how to define it … there’s no pristine definition.” But the DSM (the standard US manual that defines psychiatric illnesses), Parker says, has “progressively lowered and lowered the criteria for clinical depression.” Normal or “normative” depression has progressively been introduced into the “clinical domain”. </p> <p>Secondly, there are some other factors that are relevant: “destigmatisation has meant that many people who have had serious depression and would never have talked about it, now do so openly.”</p> <p>Third: there has been an increase in the diagnosis of some clinical disorders, like bipolar. The question is though, that the definition of “serious” or “clinical” depression is so vague: under the DSM, clinical depression can be broken up into 319 constituent disorders!</p> <p>“If you’ve got a dumb model, then you risk a dumb application,” he says. That could mean overtreatment, or for people who have “major biological disorders” and would respond well to medicine, improper treatment.<br /></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-30T06:46:17.155+01:00\">at 3.46pm AEST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5401550ce4b0b881942ff959\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-30T05:37:53.316+01:00\">2.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">AEST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pussy Riot are in the house</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alekhina’s talk has just begun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/anna__madeleine/statuses/505575099756331008\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Pussy Riot at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FODI?src=hash\">#FODI</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/WTZXs65waL\">pic.twitter.com/WTZXs65waL</a></p>&mdash; Anna Madeleine (@anna__madeleine) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anna__madeleine/statuses/505575099756331008\">August 30, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And if you want a close-up, here they are backstage with ABC journalist Julia Holman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JulesHolman/statuses/505181084418441216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/abc730?src=hash\">#abc730</a>&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MoniqueSchafter\">@MoniqueSchafter</a> speaking with the gals from Pussy Riot.

That was Elizabeth Pisani’s recommendation to the World Bank while she was working as an epidemiologist in Indonesia. In her talk, <strong>Corruption Makes the World Go Round</strong>, Pisani explains that after the destabilisation of the Indonesian state in the 1990s, the military had to go in search of “more predatory sources of funding”. Her investigation into the issue found a surprising correlation between the areas where soldiers were stationed and the biggest sites of heroin use, the major factor in the spread of HIV.<br /></p> <p>“Am I saying that soldiers should be able to deal smack so they can fund their military operations – obviously not,” Pisani says. “But we need to ask what function that corruption may have been playing beside enriching individuals.”</p> <p>Pisani’s time in Indonesia convinced her that corruption is embedded in cultural values. She gives a couple of Indonesian examples – Acehnese rebels creaming off tsunami reconstruction funds and suddenly becoming politically appealing to the same generals who were fighting them in the first place; regional politicians pulling strings in Jakarta to get their children jobs; cultural sensitivities around the distribution of food aid – to show that tensions between central bureaucrats and decentralised regional demands can often produce outcomes that we might identify as corrupt, but which aren’t perceived that way in remote communities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-21b061f7-d827-4ba8-8a26-4dac60249457\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/30/1409373916721/a012f1c8-5399-4a81-a8dd-849430e0f759-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Pisani\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Pisani, photographed for the Guardian earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/Murdo Macleod</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does this mean that “some countries are more corrupt than others”? Only if we transfer the framework for dealing for corruption from one country to another, Pisani insists. When it comes to “more mature democracies”, we should ask about cultural sensitivities too – even Abraham Lincoln engaged in practices we would identify as corrupt to abolish slavery. In the US since then, she notes, “the use of federal earmarks [a kind of pork barrelling] has been an absolutely core part of the American political process”. </p> <p>“A lot of people think that’s wasteful and corrupt – and I would have to agree with them. Between 2011 and 2013 there were attempts to try to address that by making certain types of pork barrelling difficult or frankly illegal,” she said, adding that she thought this was a factor contributing to the deadlock in US politics, because “there’s no way of essentially greasing the wheels of the legislative process to arrive at agreement”.</p> <p>Pisani thinks democracy is “inherently transactional … you can transact in different ways”. That might mean paying cash directly for votes directly – a corrupt outcome – or transacting with the electorate by having a policy platform that is applied to everyone equally. What matters is that we deal with those different types of transactions in their specifics, rather than talking about “corruption” in a one-size-fits-all way:</p> <p>“Extractive corruption – graft – taking money from the state and sticking it a swiss bank account, that sort of graft is actually rather easier to deal with and very important to deal with. Other types of corruption – what I would call distributive corruption, patronage – is often more culturally embedded.”</p> <p>She also asks a few pointed questions about Australia. “Say a prominent politician’s daughter is given a scholarship ... is that corruption? If so, who’s guilty? The college, the daughter, the politician? It’s hard to know.” But she is certain about one thing: it is “unacceptable to give a bottle of Grange Hermitage to someone who doesn’t even remember drinking it!”</p> <p>From superannuation to corruption – what a cheerful morning!

Read a 2014 Observer interview with her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/mar/09/elizabeth-kolbert-whole-world-becoming-zoo\">here</a>.</p> <p>Kolbert outlines three significant ways we are seeing this change manifest: in the atmosphere, in our oceans and in the “principles of geographic distribution”. She goes over ground that will be familiar to many: the dramatic rate at which humans are spewing CO2 into the air; the effects this is having on global climate and ocean acidity levels; and the impact of 10,000 species being moved around the world each day.</p> <p>She frames these huge waves of change through the lens of several species of plants and animals, and their fate. Take the Hawaiian crow called Kinohi who is the last of his species and the researcher who has the task of “stroking Kinohi in a way that Kinohi is meant to find terribly exciting”.</p> <p>Or the African clog frog that lays eggs when injected with the urine of a pregnant woman.

The crux of his argument is this: as climate change and the responses to it become more pronounced, carbon emitting assets, like coal-fired power plants, will become increasingly stranded and will decrease in value. “The risk nature is very complex,” Hewson said, and financial markets aren’t much good at pricing that risk.<br /></p> <p>Big funds, like university endowments, super funds and sovereign wealth funds need to realise this, Hewson reckons. If they don’t, we face two serious consequences. First, it opens us up to the risk of a financial crash as those assets decrease in value – and the investments funds have made become worthless. Underpricing climate risk is a “phenomenal punt”, Hewson says, which “dwarfs for example, the risk of the subprime market”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6ad4f23c-85d0-4284-9d86-5693f67d12c4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/31/1409442684624/710d6c91-4745-4fcb-8755-16d3f00c5ca9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The carbon repeal bills will go before Parliament for a third time this week.

The whole system of debt, the excessive debt that was built up at that time … was a risk that was clearly underpriced and under recognised by the financial community.”</p> <p>That should draw a “fiduciary response” from fund managers, trustees and so on, who have a duty to maximise the return to investors. Hewson is interested in surveying and lobbying those who control the cash to get them to realise they may actually be risking a breach of their directors’ duties. He is even considering a legal challenge to one of the major funds on this basis, which he admits is a high-risk strategy. Consequently, he’s spending a lot of time with lawyers.<br /></p> <p>The second problem should be obvious: if we don’t address the problem, climate change will “destroy the planet”, hence the title of Hewson’s talk. </p> <p>This is the interesting part – Hewson appreciates the urgency of the climate issue, but thinks it’s important to work within existing systems. Hence his focus on trying to bring the climate question under the purview of directors’ duties, current financial structures and so on. He is a former Liberal politician, after all. <br /></p> <p>So his organisation “surveys, rates, names and shames” the top 1000 funds, but doesn’t press them to take any particular action. He doesn’t insist on divestments or boycotts, which are the current responses preferred by organisations like <a href=\"http://350.org/\">350.org</a> and some Australian university groups, but instead says a range of solutions are available once funds analyse their risk. Divestment and boycotts are obviously two options, or divesting from exposed assets at the margins, but Hewson also mentioned hedging against the risk, and investing in renewables as possible responses.<br /></p> <p>There are a few major barriers: funds demand transparency from companies they’re investing in, regarding their exposure to climate risk, but refuse to make those disclosures themselves.

Year after year, Sydney’s luvvies can’t get enough of it – tickets to the big name speakers, like Salman Rushdie and Pussy Riot, have sold out. And every year, posers pick on Fodi for being too leftwing, too corporate, or just not dangerous enough. Either way, the festival, inaugurated in 2009, is going strong in its sixth year.<br /></p> <p>This year’s festival has attracted controversy before the first speaker has even collected their lanyard and pass. Back in June, one of the scheduled speakers, Uthman Badar of radical Muslim organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir, pulled out of the festival after outrage over his slated topic: Honour Killings Are Morally Justified. Were honour killings too “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/25/are-honour-killings-really-too-dangerous-to-be-discussed-in-public\">dangerous</a>” to be discussed? Was Badar the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/26/uthman-badar-both-islamophobias-victim-and-unwilling-accomplice\">casualty</a> of yet another round of Islamophobia? We canvassed some of these views at the time on Comment is Free.</p> <p>And in the last week or so, calls have grown louder for Pussy Riot, the headline act, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/29/should-pussy-riot-boycott-the-festival-of-dangerous-ideas?CMP=twt_gu\">boycott the festival</a>. The St James Ethics Centre, one of the co-convenors of the festival, has links to Transfield, one of the central companies in the Coalition Government’s Operation Sovereign Borders regime.

The escalation of fighting in Ukraine saw falls accelerate, with Germany's Dax dropping more than 1%.</p><p>All this outweighed better than expected figures from the US, where economic growth in the second quarter was stronger than expected, jobless claims fell for the second week and July pending home sales beat economists' forecasts.</p><p>Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p><p><blockquote>Shares in Europe started on the back foot and never got the chance to take a step forward today after weak German inflation and unemployment data was made all the more worrisome by the prospective of no extra stimulus from the ECB in its upcoming meeting.<br /><br />Downside momentum accelerated for stocks when Ukrainian President Poroshenko said that 15,000 Russian soldiers have been deployed into the Donetsk region in the east of the country. A Russian 'incursion' into Ukraine significantly dents the idea of a de-escalation after the presidential talks yesterday.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Mining shares were under pressure following a fall in iron ore prices in China, a key consumer of metals.</p><p>So <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> was down 126.5p at £32.09 while <strong>Anglo American</strong> was 55.5p lower at 1512.5p and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> lost 54.5p to £18.91.</p><p>But building supplies group <strong>CRH</strong> climbed 28p to £14.26 after Credit Suisse raised its recommendation from underperform to outperform. The bank said:</p><p><blockquote>[CRH[ has fallen around 20% from its 2014 high, without any associated earnings downgrade and as such has derated materially from 11 times to 8 times consensus EBITDA. This has presented an investment opportunity in a stock where we are increasingly upbeat about 2015 on account of both trading outlook in the US and Europe, and the extent to which sales growth will be amplified by significant operational leverage given the very depressed current state of group profitability.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Elsewhere <strong>CSR</strong>, whose chip designs are used in products such as mobile phones and bluetooth headsets, soared 205p to 780p after it confirmed <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/35629c52-2e5b-11e4-b330-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3Bb1By0pn\" title=\"\">a Financial Times report it had received a bid approach.</a> The predator was <a href=\"http://www.microchip.com/\" title=\"\">US group Microchip Technology</a>, but CSR said the proposed price had been rejected and it was considering its options for the company. Microchip now has until 25 September to make a firm bid, or walk away. Numis issued a buy note on CSR, saying:</p><p><blockquote>In May, Microchip announced the acquisition of ISSC, a Taiwanese low end competitor of CSR's in Bluetooth, for $317m. The bulk of Microchip's business is in microcontrollers and with the onset of Internet of Things, it appears to be looking to gain connectvity capabilties. Given it has made such a recent acquisition in the space, it is somewhat surprising that it is now interested in acquiring CSR. The statement from CSR mentions no other talks with potential bidders, but given the FT article this morning it seems that other potential bidders are likely to be being sounded out now.</blockquote></p><p></p><p>News of the approach also lifted peer <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong>, up 12.3 at 216.1p, and even FTSE 100 listed <strong>Arm</strong>, 4p better at 964.5p.</p><p>Supermarkets were also in the spotlight.</p><p><strong>Morrisons</strong> rose 2.5p to 186.9p as Deutsche Bank moved from sell to hold, amid hopes that despite lower sales in Wednesday's latest figures from Kantar Worldpanel, the supermarket group might be turning the corner. But Deutsche downgraded <strong>Tesco</strong>, helping push its shares 3p lower to 246.3p. The bank said:</p><p><blockquote>We continue to see fundamental valuation support for the shares but management change (new chief executive Dave Lewis will start on 1 October and new chief financial officer lan Stewart will start on 1 December) introduces the possibility for a change in strategy and competitive actions. Given low visibility as to potential changes, and their implications, and a lack of identifiable catalysts in the coming months, we lower our price target from 313p to 280p and downgrade from buy to hold.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Meanwhile shares in Morrisons' partner <strong>Ocado</strong> slumped 64.3p to 339.3p after a sell note from analysts at Redburn, who cut their sales forecasts and reduced their price target from 500p to 257p.</p><p><strong>Tullow Oil</strong> added 10p to 731p after it reported successful results from a series of tests in Kenya. The Etom-1 well in the northern part of the Lokichar basin discovered 10 meters of net oil pay extending the proven oil basin northwards. The Amosing-2 and Ngamia-3 appraisal wells further south were also successful. Westhouse Securities said:</p><p><blockquote>These results are an incremental positive but worth only a few pence on the share price at this time.<br /></blockquote></p><p>One of the day's big fallers was inkjet specialist <strong>Xaar</strong>, down 121p or 22% to 439p after it cut its revenue forecast from the £130m it expected last month to between £115m and £125m. It blamed weaker demand from the ceramic tile sector, linked to a slowdown in construction activity in China. The company has already issued one warning in June. Analysts said the price fall could leave it vulnerable to a bid.</p><p>But <strong>Playtech</strong>, which supplies software for sports betting and online gaming businesses, put on 49p to 712p after it said full year profits were expected to come in ahead of forecasts, helped by contract wins in Mexico, the UK and Italy. Half year adjusted profits rose 44.8% to €96.8m. Canaccord Genuity said:</p><p><blockquote>The shares have fallen 6% year to date (admittedly, following stellar performances in 2012/2013) and trade on a 2014 forecast enterprise value/Ebitda of just 10.2 times and PE of 13.7 times (falling to 12 times, after stripping out net cash). We see this as highly attractive for a technology leader in a dynamic market, particularly given potential fire power for deals with €442m of projected year-end net cash – if it acquired €442m of businesses on an 8 times Ebitda multiple, it would be around 23% earnings per share enhancing in the first year. We raise our target price from 825p to 840p [which] represents 27% potential upside from current levels.</blockquote></p><p></p><p><strong>Unite</strong> dipped 2.2p to 438p despite the student accommodation specialist reporting a 34% rise in half year earnings to £20.4m. The company is confident about the outlook, with student numbers expected to increase in the coming years. It said:</p><p><blockquote>The outlook for our sector remains very strong with university applications for 2014 up 3.6% year-on-year. Applications continue to outstrip available places significantly (by 180,000 in 2013 and forecast to be at similar levels in 2014) and with the government increasing the number of funded places by 30,000 for 2014 and lifting the cap on places altogether for 2015 we expect to see this strong demand translate into consistently higher student numbers in the coming years.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Finally <strong>Afren</strong>, the oil explorer which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/31/afren-oil-company-chief-executive-suspended-shares-fall\" title=\"\">last month suspended its chief executive and chief operating officer </a>after discovering \"unauthorised payments\" allegedly for their potential benefit, has now made a similar decision regarding two associate directors. The two, Iain Wright and Galib Virani, have been temporarily suspended after the board said it was made aware by them that they had received payments linked to the previously identified sums.</p><p>Afren fell 11p to 99.5p.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/aug/28/ftse-falls-ukraine-tensions-csr-soars","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/aug/28/ftse-falls-ukraine-tensions-csr-soars","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Do dams destroy rivers?","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-27T16:16:33Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/live/2014/aug/27/do-dams-destroy-rivers","fields":{"body":"<div id=\"block-53fe1098e4b06f5272fb40a7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T18:11:02.601+01:00\">6.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An interesting late perspective from Mike Muller of the University of the Witwatersrand.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Indeed, dams do change the world and its natural environment. So do cities, roads, airports, chemical industries and agriculture. In general, we can say that people change their environment. The richer they are, the more change they induce. In the course of that, they often destroy species; they also create species, but that is not often measured or mentioned. </p> <p>“The notion that some static measure of biodiversity is good and any change is bad is not substantiated by natural history. As an example, sedimentation as a process is the base of geology, many millennia old, many thousands of metres deep.</p> <p>“So the IRN’s latest database is simply that:- a collection of data (of variable quality) with no inherent information about whether what is happening is good or bad.</p> <p>“What we need to take from this debate is the realisation that we now live in an anthropocene world, whose form is increasingly structured and sustained through human decision. We can take deliberate decisions about what kind of world we want to live in. </p> <p>“But that WE is not a small group of North American environmentalists and their friends.

There is really no way to conclusively answer this question except on a dam by dam basis. Most people seem to accept that there are dams which represent best practice and can have a limited impact. But the results from International Rivers’ database highlight one important fact - most dams are not best practice.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T17:16:33.520+01:00\">at 5.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53fdd871e4b0231e2167ef64\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T16:55:15.909+01:00\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Colin Thorne, a professor of geography at Nottingham University says the short answer is “yes” dams do destroy rivers as ecosystems.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Many of the dams built during the 20th century have proven to be river killers. Examples are numerous and notorious.”</p> </blockquote> <p>However he also notes the positive impact dams have had in reducing the sum of human misery and encouraging development.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“For example, the drought in the Horn of Africa was a disaster that cost the lives of millions, but the High Assam Dam spared Egypt from a drought that would have been truly catastrophic,” says Thorne.</p> </blockquote> <p>Many of the dams built in the last century were poorly designed and many are now in the process of being removed. He says the evidence so far is that nature bounces back surprisingly well after dam removal.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“The good news is that nature is not only more vulnerable to dams than was realised, it’s also more resilient than we thought. So maybe the destruction of a river by damming it isn’t terminal.”</p> </blockquote> <p>He notes that dam building is no longer de rigueur in the west and that vigorous river restoration industries have emerged in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the USA. In the US the Bureau of Reclamation no longer builds dams, but spends more of its time removing them.</p> <p>But in the developing world, dam building is still booming, while China is finances a large amount of the new construction that threaten river systems in Africa and South East Asia.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Consequently, the question I think is prescient is not whether dams destroy rivers, but whether it is possible to build dams that <em>don’t</em> destroy rivers? The short answer is, ‘no’, but the longer answer is, ‘well, it may be possible to build dams that <em>damage</em> the river but avoid destroying it, provided they are designed carefully and operated responsibly’.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Thorne says there is an unavoidable trade off between the benefits dams bring and the harm they do. He says the pragmatic approach is to recognise that dams are going to be built because they drive development and generate money. This makes it imperative to understand the effect of dams on ecosystems and people and apply best practice to limit the damage done to the river.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53fdfe3fe4b0084228cf8429\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T16:53:41.702+01:00\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dr Simon Gosling from Nottingham University has followed up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/aug/27/do-dams-destroy-rivers#block-53fdb4d1e4b0231e2167ef37\">his earlier comments</a> to address some questions about the carbon impacts of dam construction.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“A number of the quotes and references today point out the importance of good management when it comes to dam construction and it’s worth reiterating that here. </p> <p>“<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969711008278\">An interesting study</a> was conducted in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area between 2000–2010.

Carbon emissions vary from dam to dam, says Philip Fearnside from Brazil’s National Institute for Research in the Amazon in Manaus. “But we do know that there are enough emissions to worry about.”</p> <p>In a study to be published in <em>Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change</em>, Fearnside estimates that in 1990 the greenhouse effect of emissions from the Curuá-Una dam in Pará, Brazil, was more than three-and-a-half times what would have been produced by generating the same amount of electricity from oil.</p> <p>This is because large amounts of carbon tied up in trees and other plants are released when the reservoir is initially flooded and the plants rot. Then after this first pulse of decay, plant matter settling on the reservoir’s bottom decomposes without oxygen, resulting in a build-up of dissolved methane. This is released into the atmosphere when water passes through the dam’s turbines.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T16:34:41.588+01:00\">at 4.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53fdf71ce4b0231e2167ef87\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T16:23:49.612+01:00\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/emperoo/statuses/504647780905017346\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen\">@KarlMathiesen</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian\">@guardian</a> Quick search on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IUCNRedList\">@IUCNRedList</a> looks like &gt;30% of  freshwater animals at risk of extinction include dams as a threat</p>&mdash; Emma Brooks (@emperoo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emperoo/statuses/504647780905017346\">August 27, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53fdf10ee4b06f5272fb4077\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T16:07:25.269+01:00\">4.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dam Effects have created <a href=\"http://www.dameffects.org/index.html\">a lovely interactive graphic</a> of the way in which a river is affected by both poorly and well run hydro projects.

Dijkstra says that in the tropics the percentage is probably even higher.</p> <p>He explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Standing waters contribute less to overall biodiversity because those sites are typically less predictable in time and space: its inhabitants thus tend to be better dispersers and therefore have larger ranges. River species, on the other hand, often disperse poorly and therefore are unique to a specific river system. So two rivers are likely to have different species, while two lakes tend to have the same.”</p> </blockquote> <p>He says the effect of dams, transforming huge sections of rivers and tributaries from flowing systems to standing “has a disproportionate impact on global biodiversity”.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“To summarize, the biodiversity argument is huge because freshwater is so much richer than anything else, and because each river system is unique, like a freshwater island surrounded by an inhospitable sea of land.”</p> </blockquote> <p>He says arguments made regarding human benefit “is difficult and emotionally charged”. But he says the argument that millions of lives can be saved from flooding by dams is “difficult to swallow”.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Flooding is as natural and important a phenomenon to river hydrology and ecology as the climatic seasonality that causes it.

So there is a good chance some of the places that have the most dams per 100km (the best measure on their database of dam intensity) in North America, Europe and China would have lower biodiversity than the big South American and African rivers <em>with or without</em> the dams. Therefore looking at raw “snapshots” of biodiversity can be misleading and probably a more helpful measure in this context is <em>change</em> in biodiversity post dam-building.”</p> </blockquote> <p>If anyone knows of studies on the changing biodiversity in rivers affected by dams, please post links to them in the comments below.</p> <p>Dixon says the percentage of sedimentation trapped upstream is an interesting measure as it can be used to ascertain the effect dams are having on the way the river shapes the lands around it.<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“There are examples of dams which have reduced sediment supply downstream resulting in rivers scouring the remaining sediment below the dam down to bedrock (with severe implications for ecosystem health), or of rivers which have formerly had multiple channels (braided) changing to a single channel rivers with extensive exposed sediment bars/islands. In addition some rivers deliver fine sediment to floodplains with seasonal flooding which enriches the land for farming, and with reduced sediment supply post dam construction this benefit can be reduced or removed.” </p> </blockquote> <p>However he says these effects are not the inevitable result of dam building, rather the result of poor management and planning and can thus be avoided.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T13:16:56.703+01:00\">at 1.16pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53fdc2dfe4b06f5272fb4020\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T12:43:28.948+01:00\">12.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There is<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/conversations/18338/will_the_belo_monte_dam_projec.html\"> a great TED Conversation</a> from last year on the Belo Monte dam project in the Brazilian Amazon which touches on many of the themes being raised here.

Dams deliver clean energy, water storage and the ability to control floods. Given the right implementation and location dams can have hugely positive effects for a society and have low operational costs.

Our human species hasn’t yet created any other technology capable to produce these three categories of macro-benefits, indispensable today for our existence.”</p> </blockquote> <p>He says the focus of the International Rivers database is on the physical effects of dams on river systems. But there is another factor to consider, the social effects of displacement due to dam building, which he calls “the primary and most serious economic and moral problem with dams on a global scale.”</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Dams, however, do have immense destructive impacts, but these are primarily of a social nature: the forced physical and economic displacement of huge cumulative amounts of people to create room for dams and their reservoirs. A tsunami of dam building is now unfolding in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Tens of millions of people have been and are forcibly uprooted; they end up worse off, immediately impoverished, with broken livelihoods; their poverty and impoverishment is telescoped to the next generation. This is empirically confirmed by legions of researchers and scholars. Yet despite the indisputable evidence, it is financed and encouraged by many international development agencies and by private sector corporations, often under the banner of “poverty reduction” and “public purpose projects”. Impoverishment by displacement is inevitable, yet it is tolerated, denied or papered over in disingenuous reports.”</p> </blockquote> <p>What is your reaction to this comment? Are the biodiversity impacts of dams of less degree or importance than the social impacts?

Make sure to have a look through it <a href=\"http://www.internationalrivers.org/worldsrivers/\">here</a>.</p> <p>The major findings from the data, which was collated from geographic databases and dam inventories, were:</p> <p><em>Priority basins for remediation</em></p> <p>The basins that rank the highest in overall combined fragmentation and lowest in water quality are the Hai Ho, Tigris-Euphrates, Wisla, Dnepr, Yellow, Danube, Godavari, Mississippi, Indus, and Volta basins.</p> <p><em>Priority basins for preservation</em></p> <p>The basins that rank the highest in biodiversity, the highest in water quality, and the lowest in fragmentation are the Amazon, Tocantins, Ayeyarwaddy, São Francisco, Orinoco, Paraná, Congo, Zambezi, Yangtze, and Mekong basins.</p> <p><em>Other findings</em></p> <ul> <li>River fragmentation due to dams correlated with poor levels of water quality about 80% of the time in the basins that were studied.<br /></li> <li>Mercury contamination is high in about 72% of basins that are the most highly fragmented.<br /></li> <li>Fragmentation has led to high amounts of sediment trapped upstream, in about 61% of basins.<br /></li> <li>80% of basins that have the highest number of dams also have the highest amount of thermal pollution. This could signify that dams have been built in basins with high existing industrial activity, or dams have served as a driver for industrial activity, or both.<br /></li> <li>Poor levels of water quality are correlated to low levels of species density in 62% of basins, meaning that fragmentation due to dams is a significant factor in biodiversity loss. </li> </ul> <p>The authors make clear that “the findings should be interpreted simply as statistical inferences, not as direct, causal relationships”.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T11:05:51.332+01:00\">at 11.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53fda0ebe4b0084228cf83c3\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-27T10:53:22.009+01:00\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to the eco audit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A new database has found links between the declining health of the world great rivers and the dams that break up their natural cycles.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.internationalrivers.org/worldsrivers/\">State of the World’s Rivers</a>, an interactive survey of the world’s 50 largest river basins, found almost 6,000 dams (a fraction of the estimated 50,000 that exist in all rivers on earth). The Hai Ho, Tigris-Euphrates and Wisla basins were found to have the highest degree of fragmentation. Whereas the Amazon, Tocantins and Ayeyarwaddy were among those highlighted as the most pristine and in desperate need of protection.</p> <p>The study found correlations between fragmentation by dams and poor water quality, mercury concentrations, sedimentation, thermal pollution and declining biodiversity.</p> <p>The data was collated by <a href=\"http://www.internationalrivers.org/\">International Rivers (IR)</a>. Executive director of IR Jason Rainey said the global perspective showed that rivers worldwide needed greater attention and protection. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“The evidence we’ve compiled of planetary-scale impacts from river change is strong enough to warrant a major international focus on understanding the thresholds for ‘river change’ in the world’s major basins, and for the planet as a whole system.”</p> </blockquote> <p>But IR warns that the correlations with poor health are only statistical and further study of individual cases is necessary to understand exactly how dams impact rivers. </p> <p>Across the world thousands more dams are being planned. In Brazil’s Paraná and Amazon basins there are 666 dams in production. China plans to build 94 large and 73 small dams on the relatively healthy Yangtze. </p> <p>Today, with your help, I’ll be trying to find out more about how these massive interruptions might change and degrade these mighty waterways.

As a South African government minister and deputy president, she led programmes to combat poverty and share the benefits of economic growth, with a particular focus on women. Actively involved in civil society and the struggle to end apartheid, she is a longtime champion of social justice, women’s rights, and gender equality.</em></p> <p><strong>Women’s Economic Empowerment is one of UN Women’s four strategic pillars, and you’ve made it clear that this is a priority for you as Executive Director. Why is this so important?</strong></p> <p> Women’s economic empowerment is absolutely essential to gender equality. It’s a matter of basic fairness that women are able to fully and equally participate in the economy. With a livelihood and an income of their own, women have increased status, can provide for their families, and become empowered in other parts of their lives as well, such as making decisions about education, housing, food choices, and medical care. That’s why women and the economy was included as a strategic objective in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the road map to gender equality adopted by 189 governments almost 20 years ago.</p> <p> There’s hard evidence that gender equality and women’s empowerment are powerful drivers of economic growth and national income. For example, a recent IMF study found that gender equality in labour participation rates would have a strong positive impact on GDP growth. Other studies have shown that Fortune 500 companies with the most women managers have shareholder returns 34% higher than those with the fewest women managers. Goldman Sachs researchers found that if women’s paid employment rates were raised to the same level as men’s in 15 major developing economies, income per capita would rise by 14% by 2020, and 20% by 2030. It’s important to say though, that not all work is equally empowering. Working conditions matter. So does the type of work that women do. </p> <p><strong>Achieving women’s economic empowerment is not a quick fix, but will take sound policies and a long term commitment from a variety of stakeholders.</strong><strong> What are some of the strategies that UN Women has identified to promote more inclusive growth for women?</strong></p> <p><strong><br /></strong>The first step toward increasing inclusion is reducing exclusion. Some 800 million women worldwide are kept out of the labour force due to a range of factors including discrimination and a lack of access to education and training. It’s hard to believe in 2014, but a recent World Bank study of 143 economies found that 128 still have at least one legal difference in how men and women are treated. That includes laws that make it impossible for a woman to independently obtain an ID card, to own or use property, to access credit or to get a job. And we know that around the world, women continue to earn less than men for work of equal value.</p> <p>The good news is that there are clear solutions. We must legislate to remove barriers to equal opportunities in education and the economy, and at the same time, we must implement existing laws. We have witnessed that laws such as those mandating equal pay for equal work are not enough in themselves – we have to ensure that those commitments are backed by real action. We also need to tackle women’s immense burden of unpaid care work – as well as time-consuming household tasks like collecting water and fuel. Other essential strategies are to ensure that women and girls have equal access to education and training, as well as to productive resources like land and credit. These are important strategies in their own right. They also have powerful compounding effects as women’s status and independence grow.</p> <p>Accomplishing these changes is going to take work by many sectors and partners: our natural partners in the women’s movement and civil society, extended to new constituencies, including young people, men and boys, religious leaders, cultural and traditional authorities, the military and the private sector. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ffd0a995-6376-4456-b177-42167a051e01\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/26/1409066280197/5f3d0780-e5eb-43d5-825e-38f78d1ea77e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka in Long Bien market, Phuc Xa ward, Hanoi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka gives a talk during her visit to Fund for Gender Equality Grant project in support of migrant workers working in Long Bien market, Phuc Xa ward, Hanoi, Viet Name Photograph: /UN Women</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What role do you see the private sector playing in this effort?</strong></p> <p>The private sector can provide vital leadership here. One billion women are set to enter the global economy in the next decade – they constitute both a powerful new economic force and an emerging market comparable to India or China. This is a massive opportunity for businesses that are committed to empowering women, that offer family-friendly work practices, promote more women, and that look for ways to include and engage them. When it comes to finance, it is estimated that up to 70% of formal small and medium-sized enterprises owned by women in the developing world are unserved or underserved by financial institutions. This represents a financing gap of $285bn and a significant opportunity for the sector.</p> <p>UN Women, along with multi-stakeholder platforms like the Business Call to Action and the UN Global Compact, stands ready to work with you. One place to start is with our <a href=\"http://weprinciples.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women’s Empowerment Principles</a>. I would encourage all business leaders to get a copy from our website, sign up to the statement of support, and work with us to implement the principles. </p> <p><strong>Can you tell us a bit more about UN Women’s new Private Sector Leadership Advisory Council, launched in June? </strong> </p> <p> My experience as minister for minerals and energy in South Africa showed me the importance of making connections between policymakers and business leaders. Sustainable results for women’s economic empowerment can only be achieved if we work together as allies and partners. I was very proud to launch the <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/6/private-sector-leadership-advisory-council-launched\" rel=\"nofollow\">UN Women Private Sector Leadership Advisory Council</a> in June this year. The council’s focus is to accelerate economic and social progress for women and girls worldwide by combining the expertise, reach and resources of UN Women and the private sector – advising one another as we seek greater results in improving women’s lives and livelihoods. We are already working with some of these companies, so it seemed like a natural next step to turn our collective capacity to some of our key priorities – and toughest challenges. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a7d8edc3-5037-416f-81cf-eab2f3009f51\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/26/1409067660246/6829527c-88bb-458c-84cd-9cba5ad54ed6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka watches a play \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka watches a play about the life of female migrant workers in Hanoi. Photograph: /UN Women</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>UN Women is also working hard to strengthen the ICT agenda. Can you talk about the critical gaps in women’s education and the digital divide and how this contributes to inequity? </strong> </p> <p>The potential for technology education to empower women is an area close to my heart. I’ve worked as a teacher and recently finished my PhD in education and technology, and I’m very concerned by the ‘digital divide’ in access to the internet between boys and girls, men and women. </p> <p>It has been estimated that, without action, the digital gender gap could affect 350 million women in three years time. A recent report from Intel, “<a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/women-and-the-web.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women and the Web</a>” found that across the developing world, nearly 25% fewer women than men have access to the internet on average, and that the gender gap is nearly 45% in regions like sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>The jobs of the future – and many of those in the present – will require some level of digital literacy. We must ensure that women and girls aren’t locked out of the online economy. </p> <p><strong>What sort of work are you doing in this area?</strong></p> <p>At the programming level on the ground, we have too<a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/search-results?q=ICT\" rel=\"nofollow\"> many initiatives</a> for me to list! We are running digital literacy programmes in countries including Guatemala and Afghanistan, and we are supporting mobile payment and information systems for women in small business in Papua New Guinea and East Africa. UN Women has also been supporting the development of mobile apps and games to raise awareness of violence against women and support survivors in Brazil and South Africa. I must also mention that right now, UN Women is partnering with the <a href=\"http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Telecommunications Union</a> to launch a <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/7/itu-awards-for-gender-equality\" rel=\"nofollow\">new global technology award</a> that recognises outstanding contributions from women and men in leveraging the potential of information technology to promote gender equality.</p> <p><strong>How will your work with the private sector strengthen this facet of development?</strong></p> <p>The private sector can play a defining role in women’s digital empowerment and full participation in the information society. They can make a critical impact in terms of the access they provide to infrastructure, skill and content development, and in attracting and promoting women within ICT businesses and workforces. We have developed some very exciting partnerships in ICT businesses, from our work with CISCO to promote women’s entry into ICT networking academies, to the provision of ICT training resources with Microsoft through our <a href=\"http://www.empowerwomen.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Knowledge Gateway for Women’s Economic Empowerment</a>. We are also partnering with Intel on the <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/3/intel-press-release\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>She Will Connect</em></a> initiative, a project that aims to get 5 million women online over the next three years in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.</p> <p><strong>UN Women has a significant focus on violence against women. How are you working with the private sector in this area?</strong></p> <p>Violence against women is a global pandemic. Around one in three women will experience violence in her lifetime, in all regions of the world. This violence tears apart lives, families, and communities. We definitely need the private sector to be engaged in our effort to eliminate it and to ensure that every woman and girl can live free from the fear of violence.</p> <p>Under UN Women’s Safe Cities Global Initiative, supported by Microsoft, women and girls in cities including New Delhi, Marrakesh and Rio de Janeiro have been working to identify and report threats, and map and document safety risks, ranging from faulty infrastructure to dark footpaths. In Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, we are working with a local bank, Bank South Pacific, to improve the safety of women market vendors and their children, building new libraries and upgrading infrastructure.</p> <p><strong>What comes next?</strong></p> <p>Next year, the Millennium Development Goals will expire, and a new set of Sustainable Development Goals will establish a new agenda for global development. We know from the experience of the MDGs that broader progress is just not going to be possible without gender equality and women’s empowerment. Through the new agenda we want to demolish the major barriers holding back women and girls from achieving their potential and release that force for growth and change into the world’s economies and societies.

However with a business model that encourages incremental payments over 36 months, offers transparent payment through mobile banking, and encourages residents to use their panels for profit, this energy option is becoming increasingly appealing to farming communities across Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/06/rural-electrification-renewables-solar-energy\">Solar energy</a> provides a cheaper and safer alternative to diesel generators, kerosene lamps and old batteries, but a key barrier to access is cash.</p> <p>“A solar home system costs money that is not available in cash to the people we sell it to, so you need a microloan,” says Duveau, head of business development at <a href=\"http://www.plugintheworld.com/mobisol/\">Mobisol</a>.</p> <p>The cheapest 10 watt solar system can power a small radio, one to three lamps and charge up to two mobile phones for $9 a month. But is that still too expensive? Deveau says there is demand for an even more espensive system.</p> <p>“With big systems you can charge 10 mobile phones, you can run a TV for a village cinema, you can run a fridge to sell cold beers, you can earn $75-100 a month from this – suddenly your customer can become an entrepreneur.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-46e1fc80-7bb6-46c3-8429-827afae3ade4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/18/1408358743571/bc2f3fcf-7a4a-4bd5-8fd3-dfb4c908895c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"boy studies using solar-powered lamp\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boy studies at night using a solar-powered lamp in Tanzania.

Now they can take part in other commercial transactions or start a savings account.”</p> <p>Each customer has agreed for Mobisol to store their data, including a credit history, so the company knows exactly how much has been paid towards off.</p> <p>“Collecting payment by mobile makes the transaction more transparent. Our customers just pay the price of a text message to transfer money as we cover <a href=\"http://www.vodacom.com/com/main/home\">Vodacom’s M-Pesa</a> fee.”</p> <p>The increasing adoption of mobile money across east Africa has made it easier for other start-ups such as <a href=\"www.grundfoslifelink.com/\">Grundfos Lifelink (GLL)</a> to begin to plug the gap in service provision to the poorest communities.</p> <p>Across rural Africa, some 50,000 water supply points have failed, <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/africas-water-crisis-quarter-billion-dollars-down-drain\">representing a waste of US$215-360 million</a>. GLL’s product helps its customers avoid the middleman at the water pump who often takes a cut for himself and triples prices in drought season, says Peter Todbjerg Hansen, managing director of this Danish provider of water management solutions.</p> <p>“The price has been fixed within the system and you pay cashlessly, so nobody can harass you to pay a higher price.”</p> <p>The company replaced water pumps with automatic dispensers, allowing families to access water usinfg a key fob to which they have transferred money via text message.

Networks are becoming such important carriers of all kinds of information, a wider debate is needed. At what point do we think of them as a utility? How do we ensure that businesses can earn a profit but there’s adequate consumer protection?”</p> <p>For now, Mobisol and GLL are looking to introduce their services to other countries in the region by 2015. Their success will depend not just on mobile phone penetration in those communities, but on how willing customers are to put their faith in a new way of making financial transactions.</p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/blog/2014/aug/18/econet-wireless-zimbabwe-cashless-society\">Zimbabwe’s Econet Wireless and the making of Africa’s first cashless society</a></p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/14/afghanistan-solar-power-new-zealand-aid\">After the Taliban: taking solar energy to remote parts of Afghanistan</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\"><strong>Join our community</strong></a><strong> of development professionals and humanitarians.

Africa’s diaspora pays 12% to send $200 – almost double the global average.”</p> <p>Bitcoin could also cut the time it takes to send remittances. BitPesa, a Kenyan mobile money transfer firm that launched in May, says its remittance transactions are “twice as fast and 75% cheaper” than competitors, because it uses bitcoin to transfer funds. Elizabeth Rossiello, BitPesa’s founder and CEO, said: “We’re looking to bring the price [of sending remittances] as close to zero as possible.”</p> <p>BitPesa does not charge a transfer fee, but levies a 3% foreign exchange margin on each transaction. “It’s a percentage of the transfer, not a fixed fee; so that means it works really well for micro-remittance payments,” said Rossiello, a former analyst at Credit Suisse. “Nobody can beat us on price.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/statuses/474296815198552064\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>First time I&#39;ve sent money to Africa:&#10;3 wire attempts, 4 weeks, 5 banks, no luck (+ $30 in fees).&#10;&#10;Just sent in bitcoin: Immediate, free</p>&mdash; Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/statuses/474296815198552064\">June 4, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>More than 80% of the adult population in Kenya use the mobile money transfer service <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/m-pesa-services-tariffs\" title=\"\">M-Pesa</a>, which is widely accepted as payment throughout the country.

These businesses want to be licensed, but UK banks shy away, just like Barclays cut Somalia off the map,” said Rossiello, referring to Barclays’ attempt last year to cut off services to Somali remittance companies.

Often this can be achieved by subtly incorporating them in traditional foods people are used to eating – an example is the <a href=\"http://drp.dfcentre.com/project/alleviating-childhood-malnutrition-improved-utilization-traditional-foods-winfood\" title=\"\">WinFood project</a>, which sought to improve child nutrition in Cambodia and Kenya by producing a food partly made from insects.</p><h2>Artificial meat</h2><p>\"Bypassing the animal for the production of meat could enable greater access to sources of protein in developing and emerging economies,\" says Brent Taylor, co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.beyondmeat.com/\" title=\"\">Beyond Meat</a>, a company that is creating plant-based faux meat. \"The production of animal meat in developing countries is extremely costly [including environmentally]. Furthermore, countries in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa import from abroad … Meat from plants could provide self-sufficiency in meat and protein production.\"</p><p>Taylor says NGOs can benefit from the technology by collaborating with the private sector. Cost might be a stumbling block. In 2013, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/02/scientist-stem-cell-lab-grown-beefburger\" title=\"\">scientists made a burger in a lab for $250,000</a> (£148,520). If artificial meat is to feed developing countries, the more likely scenario would see NGOs buying straight from producers. For instance, Beyond Meat's 12oz chicken retails at around $5.29 – (they are considerably cheaper than animal products because livestock are less efficient at converting vegetable protein into animal protein). If the price can come down further as the technology develops, and again if NGOs could buy in bulk, it would improve their efforts to deliver the required nutrients.</p><p>\"A lot of women and children don't consume meat and are missing out on vital protein and minerals. Many adhere to food taboos,\" says Rachel Kerr, a relief worker who has worked on nutrition programmes in east Africa. \"Artificial meat could address issues of cultural-sensitivity, but people's reluctance to eat it will depend on how it's presented. My concern would be how well it can replicate the amount of protein found in animal products, and whether it's palatable.\"</p><h2>Seaweed</h2><p>Seaweed is a sustainable food source that \"requires no fresh water, land or fertiliser to grow,\" and is not susceptible to dirty soil like livestock is, says Dr Craig Rose, a marine biologist and founder of the <a href=\"http://www.seaweedhealthfoundation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Seaweed Health Foundation</a>. It's also very nutritious. \"It contains [many] minerals, trace elements, vitamin groups and proteins,\" he adds.</p><p>Rose believes there is potential for developing countries to grow, harvest and process seaweed for multiple markets. Coastal communities across Africa and Asia have been benefiting from seaweed farming for years, but some struggle to make a living. Organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.coastbd.org/\" title=\"\">Coast Trust</a> in Bangladesh are promoting seaweed cultivation and training locals to be farmers.</p><p>The FAO<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3344e/i3344e.pdf\" title=\"\"> has previously said (pdf)</a> that getting more people in developing countries eating seaweed requires scaling up production to make more of it available, and teaching communities who are unaware of its nutritious value. There is also a need to remove any assumption that seaweed is a poor man's food.</p><h2>3D printed food</h2><p>A team from National University of Ireland Galway and Concern Worldwide (<a href=\"http://3d4agdev.org/\" title=\"\">3d4AgDev</a>) has been developing 3D printed tools to help smallholders in Kenya improve farming and local food production. Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.tno.nl/downloads/3d_food_printing.pdf\" title=\"\">a group of scientists in the Netherlands (pdf)</a> is looking into using base materials such as algae and insects to create novel and nutritious food structures.</p><p>Researchers are confident that, given the emerging use of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/05/3d-printing-development-sanitation-housing\" title=\"\">3D printers in development work</a>, the 3D food technology could help ship nutrients to developing countries more efficiently. Base materials could be ground into powder before being shipped, and then processed on site, added to food substances (peanut butter, chocolate), fed through the nozzle of a 3D printer and potentially printed into any desired design, making them available during a crisis.</p><p>\"I'd imagine the distribution would be similar to that of <a href=\"http://www.nutriset.fr/index.php?id=92\" title=\"\">Plumpy'Nut paste</a>,\" says Kerr. \"If the food can be printed quickly it could have a real impact on mass treatment of malnutrition in refugee camps where food production demands aren't always met. I also like the possibility of delivering nutrients in both nondescript and aesthetically pleasing designs. This could go some way towards addressing food taboos.\"</p><p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/apr/30/nutrition-food-taboos-west-africa\" title=\"\">'Cow will make your baby fat': breaking food taboos in west Africa</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/16/food-crops-africa-plant-breeding-academy\" title=\"\">Move over rice, baobab and spider plant could be the new staple crops</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/04/south-sudan-famine-malnutrition\" title=\"\">The F-word: when can we call what's happening in South Sudan a famine?</a></p><p><strong>Join the community of global development professionals and experts. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\" title=\"\"><strong>Become a GDPN member</strong></a><strong> to get more stories like this direct to your inbox</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/7/1407428593207/Dried-and-smoked-Mopane-w-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/12/insects-algae-lab-meat-food","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/12/insects-algae-lab-meat-food","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"Ory Okolloh: 'Transparency advocates must learn from gay rights movement'","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-09T23:05:35Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2014/aug/10/ory-okolloh-transparency-campaigners-gay-rights-movement","fields":{"body":"<p>The US wants transparency. It says governments that post all their data online are more prosperous and stable than their opaque, Kafkaesque counterparts. But after the stage lights in Washington DC's Foggy Bottom district are dimmed on the US-Africa summit this week, and African leaders have jetted back to their respective capitals, the question on everyone's mind might be: will African leaders really sit around a table with NGOs and heed their calls? One of Africa's thought-leaders says she isn't so sure and thinks African open‑government activists&nbsp;might&nbsp;need&nbsp;to adopt a new&nbsp;strategy.</p><p>\"We need to learn from the gay rights movement,\" Ory Okolloh told me when we met on the sidelines of the <a href=\"http://2014.okfestival.org/\" title=\"\">Open Knowledge festival</a> in Berlin last&nbsp;month.</p><p>A fixture of Africa's nascent open government movement, Okolloh's much-lauded website, <a href=\"http://info.mzalendo.com/\" title=\"\">Mzalendo</a>, put her on the map by giving Kenyans the ability to track their once secretive parliament, earning her a place on <em>Time</em> magazine's <a href=\"http://time.com/70852/scott-walker-2014-time-100/\" title=\"\">list of the world's 100 most influential people</a>. She blogs about data openness and once used her perch as Google's policy manager in Africa to push for transparency around the continent. But she worries that the global open government movement is \"hitting a wall\" in its efforts to hold politicians accountable to their&nbsp;citizens.</p><p>\"We need to approach things in steps,\" she says. \"The first step might be publishing a government's budget. Tracking where the budget goes would be step two. Getting citizens to look at all the data would be a third step. But on a lot of these issues, the open government and open technology movement is getting frustrated.\"</p><p>Okolloh and her fellow open government advocates received a boost in 2011, when Brazil and the United States jointly launched the <a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\" title=\"\">Open Government Partnership</a> (OGP), a platform that helps activists make their governments more open, accountable and responsive to citizens. Today, some 64 nations have signed up to the plan, although only seven African nations out of 55 have joined their ranks. And while the OGP has strong backing in the UK it has almost no resonance in Asia and only tepid support in some of the EU's largest countries, such as Germany. The upshot, according to OGP, is that Sierra Leone's government is now considered to be more transparent than that of Germany or&nbsp;Japan.</p><p>Which is why Okolloh believes a lesson or two could be learned from the gay rights movement.</p><p>\"When I was in law school at Harvard, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act\" title=\"\">Defence of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) in the US was a big thing,\" she says. \"I remember the fight between the&nbsp;army recruiters and Harvard University due to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell\" title=\"\">'Don't ask, don't tell'</a>. But in recent years, the shift in the US has been dramatic. And it's a good lesson from a tactical perspective.\" One&nbsp;specific step, she believes, could be to make the case for transparency directly to policymakers rather than waiting for public opinion to lead the way. \"Gay people fought at the institutional level and said to the rest of society, 'You can all catch up with us,'\" Okolloh points out. \"And what we've seen is that attitudes are catching up. People are saying, 'Actually, the world hasn't ended.' So it has worked in the US and I think this attitude will&nbsp;spread.\"</p><p>But transparency will take a team effort. \"If you want to amplify the data that you have, you need media, you need lawyers, you need the judiciary,\" she says. \"Especially when governments try to shut down a particular website or when litigating on an issue. \"</p><p>There is, however, some room for optimism in African. Governments and civil society groups are exploiting the continent's mobile phone boom to build innovative transparency apps. In Kenya, for example, the government has begun crowdsourcing questions using Google Documents. Kenyans can write to the president, who then responds in parliament.</p><p>It's a start. But in creating an open government of the future it might be time to look to the past.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/6/1407343757529/TIME-100-Gala-TIMEs-100-M-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/10/ory-okolloh-transparency-campaigners-gay-rights-movement","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2014/aug/10/ory-okolloh-transparency-campaigners-gay-rights-movement","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Milking it: how farmers in east Africa are earning more by learning more","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-05T10:54:19Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/05/kenya-uganda-rwanda-dairy-farming-training","fields":{"body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/12/task-shifting-health-development-shortage\" title=\"\">The concept of task shifting</a> is often associated with community health workers. But the idea is equally applicable to other sectors – such as farming – and recent research into volunteer farmer trainers (VFTs) shows how lessons from community health worker schemes have informed the effectiveness of using farmers as agents of change.</p><p>The research into VFTs has been based on their use in the <a href=\"http://www.heifer.org/eadd/index.html\" title=\"\">East Africa Dairy Development (EADD)</a> project, a collaboration launched in 2008 between Heifer International, the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), Technoserve, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), and African Breeders Services (ABS). The project's first phase aimed to double the incomes of 179,000 dairy farmers in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.</p><p>Volunteer farmer trainers are an integral part of the EADD, designed to augment the over-stretched formal extension system.</p><p>\"In Uganda for example, we have an estimated 4 million smallholder farmers served by 4,000 technical extension workers,\" says William Matovu, Heifer's country director.</p><p>\"So one extension worker is serving a thousand smallholder farmers. The only way we can support the system is by ensuring we have robust communities with farmer trainers.\"</p><p>Volunteer farmer trainers are initially trained in feed and feeding systems on an intensive, two-day course, and they then train fellow farmers in their immediate community, usually other members of a dairy group. The training includes the growing of livestock feed crops and feed conservation techniques such as silage making, hay baling, and management of crop residues.</p><p>Trainers use demonstration plots on their own land, but on average, each volunteer farmer trainer also reaches five villages outside of their own, travelling mostly on foot and covering up to 4 miles a day.</p><p>Between 2009 and 2012, the volume of milk sold by farmers involved in the EADD increased by 102%, and in June this year, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-013-9463-5\" title=\"\">an in-depth study into the VFT programme</a> was published, analysing the motivations of its participants.</p><p>This understanding is important because research by organisations including the World Health Organisation has identified high rates of attrition as one of the key challenges in community health worker programmes. Recommendations made by WHO on <a href=\"http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/12/11-087825/en/\" title=\"\">how to mitigate this</a> include ensuring a robust selection system, some kind of incentive, ongoing training, and a system of recognition.</p><p>This thinking has been embedded in the VFT scheme. Recruitment of volunteer farmers, for example, is a community-based process based on criteria presented by both EADD and the community itself.</p><p>\"The community makes the decision with our input,\" says Steven Franzel, principal agricultural economist at ICRAF and co-author of the report.</p><p>\"They have to be resident in the community, be dairy farmers, and interested in helping others. Literacy is often one of the requirements, depending on how the community feels.\"</p><p>Perhaps the most important finding of the VFT study was that while income generation wasn't the greatest factor in motivating farmers to sign up (other motivations included altruism, social factors and access to training) it did become a key factor in retention. Farmer trainers have found they can earn income from selling planting materials  or providing training services – for a fee – to people from outside their immediate community.</p><p>This benefit may be contributing to the relatively low levels of VFT attrition.</p><p>\"We've found 80% of trainers have been retained,\" says Matovu. \"The strategy for retaining them has been based on financial incentive mechanisms and preparing them as entrepreneurs for knowledge and information&nbsp;sharing and technological transfer within&nbsp;communities.\"</p><p>The EADD showed that there are limitations to community-based training.</p><p>\"It doesn't work everywhere in every circumstance,\" says Franzel. \"One example is low population areas, where people don't get around enough and don't have transport. The second is with relatively high-risk complex technology. We deal with feed technologies, where the costs of making a mistake are relatively low.\"</p><p>The key message from the VFT study is that volunteer trainer systems can work, but to be sustainable they need to be carefully structured to give something back to the trainers. Entrepreneurial opportunities are a motivator, and so is social recognition and exposure, which can be achieved through certification and even branded T-shirts and caps.</p><p>Given the importance of smallholder farming in the developing world, the potential of farmer trainers is something we cannot afford to ignore, says Franzel.</p><p>\"It's been way underexploited. Funds for public extension have seen huge cuts over the years, partly because they weren't performing well, so we see this as a model that both empowers local communities and can be very effective.\"</p><p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/18/agriculture-africa-youth-unemployment-montpellier-report\" title=\"\">How to inspire a generation of farming entrepreneurs</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/16/fake-seeds-uganda\" title=\"\">Fake seeds are keeping Uganda's farmers poor</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/31/growing-coca-heroin-peru-thailand\" title=\"\">Growing drugs in Peru: finding profitable alternatives for coca farmers</a></p><p><strong>Join the community of global development professionals and experts. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\" title=\"\"><strong>Become a GDPN member</strong></a><strong> to get more stories like this direct to your inbox</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/29/1406644678151/Not-enough-local-beef-in--006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/05/kenya-uganda-rwanda-dairy-farming-training","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/05/kenya-uganda-rwanda-dairy-farming-training","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"Obama woos African leaders to counter growing Chinese influence","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-03T11:19:29Z","sectionId":"us-news","id":"world/2014/aug/03/obama-woos-african-leaders-chinese-influence","fields":{"body":"<p>Barack Obama is convening the largest ever gathering of African leaders in Washington on Monday – 50 have been invited – for a summit billed by the White House as \"elevating our engagement\" with a continent increasingly under China's influence.</p><p>But it's likely to prove a challenging few days for a president viewed with a mix of pride and frustration in African countries, where he is sometimes less well regarded than his predecessor in the White House and accused of taking insufficient interest in the continent in which his father was born.</p><p>Obama has visited Africa just twice during his presidency and his administration has been accused of lecturing rather than listening to the leaders of nations being rapidly changed by democratisation, trade and technology.</p><p>Some African delegations are disgruntled before the meetings have even started because Obama has ruled out one-on-one talks with heads of state who wish to press interests not necessarily of concern to the wider continent.</p><p>Washington has invited all but five African leaders.

China's trade with Africa rose to $200bn (£119bn) last year – largely made up of Beijing's imports of oil and minerals, and export of electronics and textiles – more than double the US and far ahead of the EU. Twenty years ago trade between China and Africa was just $6bn.</p><p>But Beijing's influence has been greatly enhanced by the large numbers of Chinese now living and working in Africa, from factory managers to traders, and by big construction projects that have rapidly transformed parts of the continent when decades of western aid was often directed to propping up authoritarian cold war allies, not development.</p><p>\"Africans say 'why do we need the United States'?\" said Foote. \"When I travel around Africa, I've seen airports, I've seen roads, I've seen railroads, I've seen ports, I've seen all kinds of things that are really impressive built by China, that you have to say the United States refused to build.\"</p><p>But the US remains dominant in security issues, which will be a strong undercurrent at the summit.</p><p>\"We are very focused on the threat of terrorism in Africa,\" said Rhodes. \"We see it as particularly acute in … North Africa, Somalia with al-Shabaab, and of course Boko Haram in Nigeria,\" he said.</p><p>Security is a tricky issue for the US and African states alike. While Washington is involved in joint operations with Uganda against Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army, directly assisting the armies of countries including Kenya and Ethiopia against Islamic extremism, and training several militaries for peacekeeping operations, it could not find any country on the continent willing to host the US's Africa military command, Africom.</p><p>John Campbell, a former US ambassador to Nigeria, said Washington also wanted to avoid being drawn in too close to  confrontations such as Abuja's battle with Boko Haram because it risks becoming associated with widespread abuses by government forces, including the killing of civilians and destruction of property.</p><p>\"The United States has to be careful not to get too identified with the regime in Nigeria which is identified with human rights abuses. That's the face of the Abuja government in parts of Nigeria,\" he said.</p><p>Human rights groups want to see a strong emphasis at the summit on issues such as spreading anti-gay legislation and increasingly authoritarian regimes in US allies such as Rwanda and Uganda. The White House says there will be \"straight talk\" about human rights but it has sent a mixed messages by ignoring the international criminal court's indictment of Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, for election violence by inviting him to the summit.</p><p>Perhaps watched most closely of all will be how Obama is received by the visiting presidents.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-443677124'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/3/1407064582993/US-Africa-summit-011.jpg' alt='US-Africa summit' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A US military wait for the Guinean prime minister, Mohamed Said Fofana, to arrive at Andrews base in Maryland.

The president's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) is estimated to have saved well over a million African lives, transformed health systems and provided education to the children of people living with HIV.</p><p>There was a wide expectation in Africa that Obama would build on Bush's successes on the continent - a belief more rooted in the fact that the future president's father was born in Kenya than anything he actually said.</p><p>Foote said that six years later Obama's reputation was mixed. While \"there is a lot of pride\" in having a president of African descent in the White House, Foote said he had been confronted at African Union summits with claims that Obama should have done more for the continent.</p><p>\"I tell them Obama is the president of the United States not Africa,\" he said. \"When they say Obama hasn't done much to help Africa, what they were talking about was more aid. You've got major corruption rampant. You're giving away major resources for a pittance. You're misspending your natural resource revenues. I think a lot of them point the finger at Obama when they should point the finger at themselves.\"</p><p>Obama conveyed much the same message in an address to a Young African Leaders meeting in Washington last month.</p><p>\"There are a lot of countries that are generating a lot of income, have a lot of natural resources, but aren't putting that money back into villages to educate children.

They seemed to be based on the fact that the president has an African father and not much more than that,\" he said.</p><p>Still, the White House has not endeared itself to its guests by saying that the president would not hold any one-on-one meetings with the visiting African leaders because there would not be time. Foote thinks that's a mistake.</p><p>\"I can't for the life of me understand why they would do that. Even if it were 10 minutes in duration to shake Obama's hand and lay out your priorities. Even to just get a picture with the president in the Oval office and show the picture back home.

But here is one we can all get behind: finding a way to cut their <a href=\"http://www.climatenewsnetwork.net/2014/06/longer-flight-paths-can-cut-climate-impact-2/\">rapidly rising carbon emissions</a>. </p> <p>Researchers at the University of Redding in Britain recently demonstrated that jets contribute less to global warming if they can dodge the places that help produce condensation trails – even if it means flying longer. So, by cutting their vapor trails, airlines could cut their carbon. <br /></p> <p>Contrails form when jets fly into cold and moist air, often when it is combined with a high pressure system. Just like clouds, contrails can trap some of the infrared energy radiating from Earth, and so have a net warming effect on the planet. <br /></p> <p>“If we can predict the regions where contrails will from, it may be possible to mitigate their effect, routing aircraft to avoid them,” says Emma Irvine at Reading’s department of Meteorology. </p> <h2><strong>Trees: make some noise!</strong></h2> <p>Here is a twist on an age-old question: if an illegal logger hacks at a tree in a rainforest, does anybody else hear it? <br /></p> <p>Soon the proper authorities might.</p> <p>Between 50% and 90% of rainforest logging is illegal; unfortunately, the authorities aren’t always around to hear – much less catch – tree poachers in action. However, a California startup, Rainforest Connection, may have found a solution: a listening device made up of old smart phones. The gadget, which looks like a rather dumb pinwheel of techno-detritus when tacked high in a tree, will be able to tell authorities when bad guys are up to no good in the forest.</p> <p>“This technology enables the forest to talk to the world,” said Neil Young, the Canadian born rocker who spoke on a video for the company’s <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/topherwhite/rainforest-connection-phones-turned-to-forest-guar\">Kickstarter campaign</a>. <br /></p> <p>The campaign has already raised nearly $40,000 of its $100,000 goal to help make the solar-powered gizmos. Besides helping saving the tress and the natural habitat, the company says it will also slow global warming. <br /></p> <p>“With each one of these devices we are able to do something equivalent of taking 3,000 cars off the road by protecting an entire square mile of endangered forest,” says Topher White, a physicist and founder of the company.</p> <p>The devices, which will be installed in Cameroon this year with expansion plans to other countries, “can detect and pinpoint signs of environmental destruction activity – such as chainsaws, gunshots and animal distress calls – at great distance.” <br /></p> <p>“This is the most exciting critical new tool I’ve seen that I think can help us get the job done,” says Randy Hayes, the founder of the Rainforest Action Network.</p> <p><em>This is the first story in ‘<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/oddly-sustainable\">Oddly Sustainable</a>’, a new series.

Your travel is monitored and in many cases restricted. If overseas, you could be stranded, costing your employment or reunion with your family. You could be detained and, certain lawsuits allege, tortured by foreign governments. </p> <p>Yet the ease with which someone can be placed on US watchlists and terrorism databases contrasts markedly with the impact placement has. A long-withheld document <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/07/23/blacklisted/\">published on Wednesday by the Intercept</a> detailing the guidelines for placement shows that the standards for inclusion are far lower than probable cause, and the ability for someone caught in the datasets to challenge their placement do not exist. In 2013, the government made 468,749 nominations for inclusion to the Terrorist Screening Database, up from 227,932 nominations in 2009; few are rejected.</p> <p>The rise – and the low standards the Intercept documented – is partially explained by the near-miss airliner bombing in Christmas 2009, by a man connected to a Yemeni branch of al-Qaida. Partially it is explained by the overwhelming secrecy surrounding the process: attorney general Eric Holder has called it a state secret (although the guidance document itself is unclassified), preventing meaningful outside challenges that would recalibrate a balance between reasonable expectations of security and liberty. </p> <p>That secrecy, as the Intercept&apos;s publication indicates, is starting to erode – slowly. Recent court cases have given the beginnings of insight into how the US government&apos;s apparatus of terrorism databases and watchlists works in practice. Here is a guide. </p> <h2><strong>They&apos;re reading your tweets</strong></h2> <p>The watchlisting guidance says that &quot;first amendment protected activity alone shall not be the basis&quot; for nominating someone to the lists. The key word: <em>alone. </em>What you say, write and publish can and will be used against you. Particularly if you tweet it, pin it or share it. </p> <p>The guidelines recognize that looking at &quot;postings on social media sites&quot; is constitutionally problematic. But those posts &quot;should not automatically be discounted&quot;, the guidelines state. Instead, the agency seeking to watchlist someone should evaluate the &quot;credibility of the source, as well as the nature and specificity of the information&quot;. If they&apos;re concerned about a tweet, in other words, they&apos;re likely to go through a user&apos;s timeline. That joke about that band blowing up could come back to haunt you at the airport. </p> <h2><strong>Where you go might get you placed on the list – and then stranded</strong></h2> <p>Contained within the guidance is a potential reason why many US Muslims find themselves <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/22/yemeni-americans-us-embassy-sanaa-passports\">abruptly unable to return from trips abroad</a> without explanation. An example given of &quot;potential behavioral indicators&quot; of terrorism is &quot;travel for no known lawful or legitimate purpose to a locus of TERRORISM ACTIVITY&quot;. Not defined: &quot;lawful&quot;, &quot;legitimate&quot; or &quot;locus&quot;. That could mean specific training camps, travel to which few would dispute the merits of watchlisting. Or it could mean entire countries where terrorists are known or suspected of operating – and where millions of Americans travel every year. </p> <p>The guidelines themselves, in that very section, warn that such behavioral indicators include &quot;activity that may have innocent explanations wholly unrelated to terrorism&quot;. It warns analysts not to judge any circumstance &quot;in isolation&quot;.</p> <p>What happens on the no-fly list does not stay on the no-fly list. A federal judge, writing in June, noted that the FBI&apos;s Terrorist Screening Center shares information on banned passengers with 22 foreign governments as well as &quot;ship captains&quot;, resulting in potential &quot;interference with an individual&apos;s ability to travel by means other than commercial airlines&quot;.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-77d6bded-b527-4c25-8908-169e6f9dfa75\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/24/1406238497610/8fb45ad0-bd3b-4892-a0c4-e2466c4a7727-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Transportation Security Administration screeners check passengers as they prepare to board flights. tsa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Transportation Security Administration screeners check passengers as they prepare to board flights. Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many people who have sued the US government over the watchlists have reported being unable to return from travel abroad. Ali Ahmed, a US citizen in San Diego, attempted in 2012 to fly to Kenya to meet his fiancee for their arranged marriage. But first he flew to Saudi Arabia to make the religiously encouraged pilgrimage to Mecca; he found himself <a href=\"http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/Jul/02/no-fly-list-grounds-another-san-diegan/?#article-copy\">stranded in Bahrain</a> after he was unable to enter Kenya. Ayman Latif, a disabled US marine originally from Miami who now lives in Egypt, was prevented from flying to the US for a disability evaluation from the Department of Veterans Affairs. </p> <h2><strong>There&apos;s room for the family (and perhaps your friends)</strong></h2> <p>A precursor data set that feeds the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB or, &quot;the watchlist&quot;) is the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center. TIDE contains records of known or suspected international terrorists. It also contains information on their families and perhaps their friends.</p> <p>&quot;Alien spouses and children&quot; of people NCTC labels terrorists get put into TIDE. They &quot;may be inadmissible to the United States&quot;, presumed to be dangerous. TIDE also contains &quot;non-terrorist&quot; records of people who have a &quot;close relationship with KNOWN or SUSPECTED terrorists&quot;, the guidance reads. Examples listed are fathers or brothers, although the guidance does not specify a blood or marital relationship as necessary for inclusion. Those people can be American citizens or noncitizens inside the United States. While those &quot;close relation[s]&quot; are not supposed to be passed on for watchlisting absent other &quot;derogatory information&quot;, their data may be retained within TIDE for unspecified &quot;analytic purposes&quot;.</p> <h2><strong>Just because a jury finds you innocent doesn&apos;t mean watchlists agree</strong></h2> <p>The guidelines explicitly state that someone &quot;acquitted or against whom charges are dismissed for a crime related to terrorism&quot; can still be watchlisted. A federal official nominating such a person for inclusion on the list just needs &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; of a danger – something defined as more than &quot;mere guesses or hunches&quot;, based on articulable information or &quot;rational inferences&quot; from it, but far less than probable cause. A judge or jury&apos;s decision is not controlling. </p> <h2><strong>Watch how you walk</strong></h2> <p>In keeping with a general enthusiasm exhibited by law enforcement and the military for identifying someone based on their seemingly unique physical attributes, biometric information is eligible as a criteria to watchlist someone. Several of those biometric identifiers are traditional law enforcement ones, like fingerprints; others are exceptionally targeted, like DNA. Then there are others that reflect emerging or immature analytic subjects: &quot;digital images&quot;, iris scans, and &quot;gait&quot; – that is, the way you walk. </p> <p>Gait and other biometric identifiers do not appear sufficient to watchlist someone. But they are sufficient to nominate someone to the watchlist or TIDE, provided they rise to the &quot;minimum substantive derogatory standards&quot; – articulable reasons for suspecting someone of involvement of terrorism, a far lower standard than probable cause – unless they come accompanied with evidence that the manner of walk in question includes &quot;an individual with a defined relationship with the KNOWN or SUSPECTED terrorist&quot;. It does not appear that a particular swagger by itself can be watchlisted. </p> <h2><strong>Lisa says …</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4fcb908f-dbbe-478b-860d-4aef3f9c42b0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/24/1406238383710/8663681063_21fb461d82_o-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama consults his  homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, in the Oval Office.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama consults his homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, in the Oval Office. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/8663681063/\">Photograph: White House</a></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lisa Monaco is a former US attorney who holds one of the most powerful and least accountable positions in the US security apparatus: assistant to the president for homeland security and counter-terrorism. She has enormous influence over the watchlisting system.</p> <p>The guidelines empower Monaco, her successor or a designee to make a &quot;temporary, threat-based upgrade&quot; to &quot;categories of individuals&quot; already watchlisted. The intent appears to be the creation of a single government official able to rapidly keep people off airlines once threat information, often fragmentary and rarely specific, emerges to indicate an imminent terrorist attack. It is unclear what characterizes a &quot;category&quot;. The White House says she has never exercised the power.</p> <p>Monaco, like others holding her position, does not answer to Congress. No Senate confirms her. Anyone who tries to obtain her official communications will face a legal defense of executive privilege. It appears commensurate with the extraordinary if inconsistent secrecy surrounding watchlisting – attorney general Eric Holder said the procedures were a state secret even as the guidelines outlining them are not classified – that she and not a Senate-confirmable appointee makes the upgrading decision.</p> <p>An administration official declined to confirm authenticity of the document, but said Monaco has never exercised any such temporary authority. The administration did not say why she and not a cabinet official or subordinate has those powers in the first place. </p> <h2><strong>You can be turned into an informant (or punished if you refuse)</strong></h2> <p>Keeping track of suspected terrorists may not be the only purpose the watchlisting system serves. Recent lawsuits allege that the FBI uses it to as leverage to turn people into snitches. </p> <p>A 30-year-old Afghan American, Naveed Shinwari, found that after FBI agents questioned him about his 2012 travel to Afghanistan – he was getting married – he couldn&apos;t obtain a boarding pass he needed for an out-of-state job interview. Soon he found himself talking to other FBI agents, who wanted to know if he knew anyone &quot;threatening&quot; his community in Omaha, Nebraska.</p> <p>&quot;That’s where it was mentioned to me: you help us, we help you. We know you don’t have a job; we’ll give you money,&quot; Shinwari, who is suing over the apparent quid pro quo, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/23/no-fly-list-fbi-coerce-muslims\">told the Guardian in April.</a></p> <p>Similarly, in Oregon, a man named <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/04/portland_muslim_claims_fbi_inv.html\">Yonas Fikre</a> is suing the government for allegedly attempting to parlay his no-fly list placement into getting him to infiltrate a prominent Portland mosque. After Fikre declined, he claims, he traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he was detained, beaten on the soles of his feet and placed in &quot;stress positions&quot; – all, he says, while his torturers asked him questions about the Portland mosque that were suspiciously similar to those the FBI asked.<br /></p> <p>Effectively, said Gadeir Abbas, attorney for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the watchlists &quot;provide law enforcement with an extra-judicial tool to impose consequences on predominantly Muslims who choose to exercise their rights instead of becoming informants.&quot;</p> <h2><strong>So much for that job</strong></h2> <p>Being unable to travel is in some ways more invasive than other forms of surveillance. Unless your friends spend their time digging through court records, they will be unlikely to find out that, say, your assets were frozen, even you suddenly can&apos;t pay for dinners. Not all jobs ask about or care about an arrest. </p> <p>Traveling is different. Being unable to travel on short notice is what Abbas calls a &quot;publicly accessible fact&quot; – that is, something your friends, family and co-workers will learn about in time. His client Gulet Mohammed is an information-technology professional in northern Virginia. &quot;Not allowing him to be able to cover great distances in a short amount of time, that has a dramatic impact on what his prospects are,&quot; Abbas said.</p> <p>Earl Knaeble IV, an army veteran from California, alleges in a lawsuit that he lost a job offered to him after he was unable to return to the US for a pre-employment medical exam after he got married in Colombia. He attempted, unsuccessfully, to drive home. </p> <h2><strong>You can&apos;t get off – yet</strong></h2> <p>There is no procedure to challenge and reverse your status on the no-fly list, the terrorism watchlist or TIDE. Inclusion on any is not typically disclosed – making legal remedies difficult – nor does the government provide any process for removal. Travelers suspicious about why their attempts to fly were unsuccessful can launch a <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/dhs-trip\">redress request</a> through the Department of Homeland Security, but that process does not challenge inclusion on a watchlist or database, nor will even successful requests guarantee against future travel restrictions. Procedures that will, identified within the guidance, are exclusively internal government processes.</p> <p>&quot;The only way to get off the federal watchlist is through the beneficence of a federal agent, routinely coupled with some form of cooperation with the FBI,&quot; Abbas said. </p> <p>But that lack of redress has now imperiled the no-fly list. Last month, in a federal judge in Oregon ruled that the inability of individuals to extricate themselves from the list is a due-process violation, rejecting the government&apos;s contention that there is no constitutional right to travel.</p> <p>&quot;Such an argument ignores the numerous reasons that an individual may have for wanting or needing to travel overseas quickly, such as the birth of a child, the death of a loved one, a business opportunity or a religious obligation,&quot; judge Anna Brown found. </p> <p>Yet the legal battle over the no-fly list is practically certain to continue. Nor does Brown&apos;s ruling touch on the broader watchlists and datasets from which the no-fly list draws. </p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/24/1406236976425/9d045489-05d2-4393-8075-7cf8672f3396-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/us-terrorism-watchlist-work-no-fly-list","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jul/24/us-terrorism-watchlist-work-no-fly-list","sectionName":"US news"},{"webTitle":"Technology-based mobile health takes off in developing countries","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-22T06:00:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/technology-mobile-health-developing-countries","fields":{"body":"<p>Soon opticians – and even their assistants – will be able to check people's vision using just a mobile phone, and it won't matter if they're not sure what they're seeing because the phone will know what to look for. Space-age future? Far from it. The eye-miracle phone is already here. In fact, it's being used in the world's poorest countries.</p><p>\"Smartphones have been getting better and better, and the fortuitous coincidence is that their optical elements are so small, in fact smaller than a pupil\", explains Dr Iain Livingstone, a paediatric ophthalmologist at <a href=\"http://www.peekvision.org/\" title=\"\">Peekvision</a>, the UK-based organisation behind the technology. \"With a few tweaks, we can put that to our advantage.\"</p><p>Peekvision's technology utilises an ordinary smartphone, which can be used in place of the expensive and complicated ophthalmoscopes that have been a mainstay of eye exams for decades. This is how it works: an optician or even a minimally trained healthcare worker points the adjusted smartphone into the patient's eye. The phone automatically focuses on what it's supposed to look for – say, a cataract – and captures the image, allowing the healthcare worker to send it on to more qualified experts by email or text message. </p><p>\"That circumvents the training an optician needs in order to operate an ophthalmoscope and understand its results\", says Livingstone. \"Anybody can conduct the eye exam.\"</p><p>With blindness being preventable in 80% of cases, there's an obvious need for eye exams, especially in the developing world. Peekvision's mobile phone has already been introduced in Kenya (and Scotland) and found to reliably identify and photograph not just cataracts but severe diabetes and macular degeneration as well. All three are leading causes of blindness. In fact, Peekvision – which is supported by the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Medical Research Council and several other institutions – is just one of many new startups and non-profits trying to merge high-tech and healthcare in developing countries. </p><p>Researchers at Harvard and MIT, for example, <a href=\"http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-08-30/news/27610987_1_chronic-diseases-detection-smart-phones\" title=\"\">have developed a technology</a> that allows medical assessments to be encoded onto smart-phones, links with ultrasound and x-ray machines, and sends the information to a central database. <a href=\"http://medicmobile.org/\" title=\"\">Medic Mobile</a>, started in a Stanford dorm room several years ago, allows healthcare workers to monitor patients far from clinics using a mobile application. Indeed mobile health (mHealth, in today's jargon) is growing rapidly, with PWC <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pwc.in%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Ftelecom%2Fgsma-pwc_mhealth_report.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3wH5VtJ0mZerleK5PrMMDE_02BQ\" title=\"\">predicting a $23bn</a> (pdf) market by 2013, up from $500m in 2010.</p><p>Here's the challenge: even though developing countries, with their less extensive healthcare infrastructure, would benefit the most from mobile health, they're only predicted to account for a small share of the market, in Africa's case 5% by 2017, according to PWC. And even though their smartphone penetration rates are expected to climb from today's <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgsmaintelligence.com%2Ffiles%2Fanalysis%2F%3Ffile%3D130828-scaling-mobile.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEFhMa0CVse5O46GlfIDzPa5fjDrQ\" title=\"\">average of 8%</a> (pdf), emerging economies won't be a massive smartphone market anytime soon. <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-06/cmaj-mhd061113.php\" title=\"\">Writing in the Canadian Medical Association Journal</a> last year, Dr Ivan Mendez of the University of Saskatchewan notes that undependable signal strength poses another challenge to smartphone-driven healthcare in developing countries.</p><p>But, says Tom Walker, CEO of Lionsgate Technologies, his company's business plan doesn't rest on selling lots of healthtech-equipped smartphones in developing countries. On the contrary, its strategy is to simultaneously tap into mobile health in both wealthy and emerging markets. The Vancouver-based company has developed smartphone applications where the phone screen acts as a monitor, while a sensor is connected to the audioport.</p><p>\"The phone can be used as a diagnostic tool for the developing world and a self-diagnostic tool in the developed world\", explains Walker. \"There's no reason that a low-cost blood-pressure tool can't sell well in, for example, the north American market.\"</p><p>In Lionsgate's business model, sales in the developed world will essentially underwrite activities in emerging markets. The company's applications for the developing world focus on healthcare workers using smartphones equipped with the technology to diagnose common diseases and medical problems such as pneumonia and preeclampsia. In wealthy countries, by contrast, it will give patients suffering from chronic conditions the option of managing some parts of their illnesses on their own. For example, the same application that's used to diagnose pneumonia in the developing world can be used by patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases in the United States, allowing them to make regular readings using simply the specially equipped smartphone. That's a potentially huge saving in healthcare costs. Given that chronic illnesses <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fchronicdisease%2Fpdf%2F2009-power-of-prevention.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdLaw26xUp0Kdn9Xk1-iJFjEeVDA\" title=\"\">account for 75%</a> of healthcare spending in the United States, for example, the market could clearly take a lucrative turn for LionsGate and companies like it. Indeed, two-year-old Lionsgate expects to be profitable by 2016.</p><p>To be sure, Americans and Brits won't be conducting their own blood oxygen readings en masse any time soon. But for perhaps the first time ever, they may soon be using the same healthcare solutions as their fellow patients in the developing world.</p><p><em>The role of business in development hub is funded by Business Call to Action.

However in Bangladesh we needed to consider voiceover SMS because the women we were targeting had lower exposure of using mobile phones and a lower literacy rate overall.</p><h2><strong>Shashi Buluswar, CEO, </strong><a href=\"http://www.ligtt.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>LIGTT Institute</strong></a><strong>, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley, USA</strong></h2><p><strong>Think beyond mobile: </strong>There have been some very exciting technologies using mobile phone systems. However, there has not been much outside the mobile space. I'd love to talk about what kinds of things are required in health and agriculture beyond mobile technologies.</p><p><strong>Beware of innovation for innovation's sake: </strong>Innovation for its own sake is a pretty big danger, especially if there is funding associated with fads. For a while, all you needed to get funding was to add the letter 'm' before anything you needed. As with many other things, it important to be responsive to real demand, rather than simply jumping on bandwagons before funding is available.</p><h2><strong>Kelly Church, credit project director, </strong><a href=\"http://www.frontlinesms.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>FrontlineSMS</strong></a><strong>, Nairobi, Kenya, </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kellybeetmush\" title=\"\"><strong>@kellybeetmush</strong></a></h2><p><strong>Usability is essential: </strong>In order to reach meaningful scale outside of a funded pilot, the tech tool must be useable. Extensive user training is not scalable. Equally important is ensuring that the tech innovation is built on a readily available and culturally appropriate platform.</p><h2><strong>Eric Okimoto, senior technology adviser, </strong><a href=\"http://www.crownagents.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Crown Agents</strong></a><strong>, Sutton, UK, </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/crownagents\" title=\"\"><strong>@crownagents</strong></a></h2><p><strong>Be willing to take a leap: </strong>ICT solutions in development are often the high risk, high reward options. They often fail, but when they succeed, they are game changers. Increasing the chances of success is often a mixture of understanding the environment and getting the right solution, starting off small and building momentum.</p><p><strong>Watch out for the old guard: </strong>Never underestimate the power of the status quo to fend off innovation. Crony capitalism exists in every country in the world and unfortunately is often the source of regulatory hurdles to undermine the scaling up of a new technology (for example how the phone operators undermined Skype and the banks going after M-Pesa).</p><h2><strong>Tony Choi, managing director, </strong><a href=\"http://www.icthope.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>ICT Hope</strong></a><strong>, Seoul, South Korea</strong></h2><p><strong>Understand that onflict of interest brings disharmony: </strong>Productive relationships between private and public sectors take place when the interests of various stakeholders are harmoniously met or resolved. Successful cases of private-public collaboration are mostly based on this. Conflict of interest is a major challenge.</p><h2><strong>Maria May, senior programme manager, </strong><a href=\"http://innovation.brac.net/\" title=\"\"><strong>social innovation lab, Brac</strong></a><strong>, Dhaka, Bangladesh, </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MariaMayhem523\" title=\"\"><strong>@mariamayhem523</strong></a></h2><p><strong>Think about scale from the start: </strong>Many times people think, first I'll get it right, then I will think about scale. You have to go the other way, think, how big do I want this to be? And design for scale from the start. Data can help organisations focus limited resources, especially the time of frontline staff.</p><h2><strong>Bright B Simons, president, </strong><a href=\"http://mpedigree.net/mpedigreenet/\" title=\"\"><strong>mPedigree Network</strong></a><strong>, Accra, Ghana, </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Goldkeys\" title=\"\"><strong>@Goldkeys</strong></a></h2><p><strong>Get corporate help: </strong>We entered a R&amp;D partnership with a major Fortune 100 company. We found that this brings discipline to the relationship, enhances mutual value in the relationship, and greatly drives results in the partnership. The alternative would have been to try the CSR or grant route, which at that time we felt had perverse side effects.</p><p><strong>Justify scaling up: </strong>In a developing country, resources are hard to come by, including human resources. So it is hard to build support and solidarity for a programme that can only make a difference in the lives of a few.</p><p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/23/africapitalism-economics-development-social-enterprise\" title=\"\">10 thoughts on Africapitalism and social enterprise</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/18/agriculture-africa-youth-unemployment-montpellier-report\" title=\"\">How to inspire a generation of farming entrepreneurs</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/15/16-dos-and-donts-of-online-campaigning-clicktivism-digital-activism-kony\" title=\"\">How to campaign online: 15 dos and don'ts</a></p><p><strong>Join the community of global development professionals and experts. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\" title=\"\"><strong>Become a GDPN member</strong></a><strong> to get more stories like this direct to your inbox</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/18/1405701249960/AFRICA-M-PESA-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/18/partnership-policy-advocacy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/18/partnership-policy-advocacy","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"World in a week: the UN says Europe must accept more Syrian refugees","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-11T18:36:37Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/11/world-in-a-week-the-un-says-europe-must-accept-more-syrian-refugees","fields":{"body":"<h2><b>Good week for</b></h2> <p><b>Girls’ education in Ghana</b>, where 72 schools are piloting a £3m interactive distance-learning project <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/11/ghana-school-girls-hi-tech-distance-learning\">that’s incorporated spider man and skiing into lessons.</a></p> <p><b>Aspiring female politicians in Namibia</b>, as the South West Africa People&apos;s Organisation has not only committed to filling half of its seats in parliament with women, but also committed to what they call <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/08/namibia-gender-equality-zebra-politics\">a &quot;zebra system&quot;, whereby if a minister is a woman, the deputy minister will be a man, and vice versa.</a></p> <h2><b>Bad week for</b></h2> <p><b>A United Nations military observer group </b>in Kashmir who were asked to leave New Delhi, where it was <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/08/us-india-un-idUSKBN0FD1DH20140708\">running a liaison office for more than four decades for free</a>.<br /></p> <p><b>Four Burmese journalists</b>, who were sentenced to 10 years in prison for publishing a report<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/world/asia/myanmar-court-sentences-journalists-to-10-years-of-hard-labor-in-prison.html?ref=world&amp;_r=0\"> that said a vast and secretive government factory was designed to produce chemical weapons. </a></p> <h2><b>Quote of the week</b></h2> <p>Here&apos;s a quote we spotted from Mia Farrow, highlighting the continued need for humanitarians in Gaza.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mia Farrow\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in Gaza just after &amp;#39;Operation Cast Lead&amp;#39;.

Looking back, what will it take to make open journalism a reality for South Africa and the continent at large?</p><p><strong>Reaching citizens</strong><br />For news to even reach citizens we have to get creative. <a href=\"http://www.telecoms.com/209421/africa-gets-smart-continent-prepares-for-device-revolution/\" title=\"\">Smartphone penetration is just 12%</a> in Africa. So what are we doing to ensure the content that matters to people is actually reaching them?</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/video/2014/jul/04/stuff-toby-shapshak-innovation-africa\" title=\"\">Innovation born out of necessity thrives in Africa</a>. Services for \"feature phones\" (low-end phones with basic internet and multimedia functionality) are emerging across the continent and many of the best solutions are home-grown. <a href=\"http://icow.co.ke/\" title=\"\">iCow</a> provides farmers in Kenya with critical information that has increased milk yields and reduced disease outbreaks via SMS. In South Africa, <a href=\"http://www.fundza.co.za/\" title=\"\">FunDza</a> publishes novels based on the reality of township living via <a href=\"http://get.mxit.com/\" title=\"\">Mxit</a>, helping to popularise reading among hard-to-reach teens.</p><p>Radio and TV shouldn't be ignored as channels for reaching the majority. Political satire such as the <a href=\"http://buni.tv/shows/1/\" title=\"\">XYZ show</a> contribute to lively debate and platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.tracfm.org/\" title=\"\">TRAC FM</a> enable community radio stations to gauge the opinions of their listeners via SMS, stimulating more participatory dialogue.</p><p>Those already online matter too and social media mustn't be forgotten. When people get online, they're going here first. This technology has given all online a voice. It's levelling the playing field, making it impossible for the powers that be to control the narrative. Traditional media can help verify and amplify stories breaking on these platforms so they reach those offline.</p><p><strong>Creating relevant and engaging content</strong><br />Content needs to be fun and locally relevant. Most people are far more interested in their local school or hospital and entertainment than some of the more traditional headline stories.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nairaland.com/\" title=\"\">Nairaland</a>, Nigeria's leading discussion forum, lures in over a million users with snippets of entertainment, politics and celebrity gossip, things that people really care about. And media is starting to move beyond the role of information provider to amplify the voices of the marginalised.</p><p><strong>Gathering and amplifying citizen voices</strong><br />For the Activate event, <a href=\"http://talkaboutlocal.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Talk About Local</a>, in association with The Guardian, <a href=\"http://talkaboutlocal.org.uk/amplifying-citizen-stories-africa/\" title=\"\">trained citizen journalists</a> to create stories about issues really affecting their communities. They spoke about families wrecked by the highly addictive drug <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoonga\" title=\"\">whoonga</a>, secret rent boys in townships, the misappropriation of orphanage funding in Lesotho and gentrification in Johannesburg. They pitched their stories to Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, and maybe soon their voices will be heard across the world.</p><p><strong>Opening up innovative news sources</strong><br />Open journalism also creates new sources for professional journalists. Activists using technology are providing remarkable on-the-ground raw material for news stories.</p><p>Citizen reporting platforms, largely built on an Kenyan innovation <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a> allow mapping of SMS messages from citizens on issues as far ranging as election-related violence, disaster management and service delivery monitoring. This real time reporting provides a completely new window into the efficiency of civic bodies. <a href=\"http://www.pa.org.za/\" title=\"\">People's Assembly</a> is also opening up the proceedings of the South African parliament. &nbsp;</p><p>Sites like <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/\" title=\"\">Global Voices</a> compile breaking stories from a network of citizen bloggers where readers can access hard-hitting stories from regions largely uncovered in the mainstream press.</p><p>Can the press use these tools to highlight citizens' concerns and hold government to account?</p><p><strong>What's next?</strong><br />Technology can support journalists by joining the dots and enabling greater scrutiny. Citizens globally have raised their expectation of government. It can also help us amplify important messages and reach citizens more rapidly, at greater scale and lower cost than ever before.</p><p>But this is just the beginning. As Ory Okkoloh of <a href=\"http://www.omidyar.com/\" title=\"\">Omidyar Network</a> reminded us, we can't forget the hard work it takes offline to translate journalism into activism. Technology works best when it's in the hands of passionate, organised activists who understand change processes and work hard to make things happen. There's also a need for good storytelling, if you want the world to listen to what you have to say.</p><p>Maximising the impact of journalists won't be easy. Many at the conference viewed the press in South Africa and the continent at large as under threat, with commercialisation and government interests controlling content and concentrating ownership. A lack of revenue is shrinking their ability to do investigative journalism and innovate fast. Civil society finance is drying up too.</p><p>Data costs are prohibitively high. On average across Africa, <a href=\"http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013-e.pdf\" title=\"\">those living on less than $2 a day must pay almost 40% their monthly income if they want to get online (pdf)</a>. Would you? Policy and regulatory reform is critical to get the continent connected.</p><p>But there is much cause for hope. The digital world has connected us all in ways never conceivable a decade ago. If journalists, activists and technologists combine their skills and passions, through the power of information, they can inspire citizens the world over to work together to create the change they want to be a part of.</p><p><em>Loren Treisman is the executive at </em><a href=\"http://indigotrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>The Indigo Trust</em></a></p><p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\" title=\"\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p><em>All Guardian Media Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled 'Advertisement feature'.

Don't mistake simple for simplistic, though. As with all effective communication, behind the brevity lies a set of complex, engaging ideas.</p><p>Take HP. The US technology company has a sustainability strategy it calls \"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/global-citizenship/index.html\" title=\"\">Living Progress</a>\", the stated aim of which is to \"create a better future for everyone through our actions and innovations\". But getting employees on board is the key to \"making that vision a reality\", says Gabi Zedlmayer, chief progress officer at HP.</p><p><strong>Aligning interests</strong><br />Yet companies face a dilemma. A catchy title might win the ear of their employees, but it won't necessarily encourage them to act. For that to happen, companies need to appeal to employees' hearts as much as their heads, says Zedlmayer: \"Being able to meld HP's long-term commitment to sustainability with the passion of our employees represents a winning formula.\"</p><p>Before corporate strategists pick up their pens, they need to discover where it is that their employees' passions lie. That means listening – through workshops, focus groups and other forms of structured dialogue. The next step should, in principle, be easy: provide the framework to let those passions loose.</p><p>Strong-arm tactics won't work, warns Jay Coen Gilbert, founder of B Lab, a US-based non-profit organisation that certifies companies as sustainable: \"Increasingly, telling people to care about sustainability – or what to do about it – is not as effective as asking them what they care about and what they think you should do about it together.\"</p><p>That logic applies across the spectrum of sustainability issues, from building stronger communities or reducing carbon emissions through to reducing workplace accidents or eliminating corruption.</p><p>Alexi Carli, global health and safety manager at UPS, stresses the importance of employee ownership too: \"If you want to nurture genuine employee engagement, it has to be less top-down and a lot more bottom up\", she says. \"Management needs to provide support and an overall framework, as well as set expectations, but real employee creativity comes when you loosen the reins.\"</p><p>UPS has clear procedures and strict targets for reducing injuries and auto accidents at work and its 3,300 health and safety committees all have management and non-management employees as co-chairs. The remaining members, approximately four to 20 people, are all operational employees. Such an approach not only gives a sense of employee ownership, but also provides the company with a ready network of peer-to-peer advocates. \"When you give employees the latitude to act and when they see that those actions have value and are making a difference, then that will make them want to do more,\" adds Carli, who notes that lost-time injury frequency has been reduced by nearly 15% since 2009.</p><p><strong>Prompting passion</strong><br />Volunteering provides another natural way of tapping into employees' passions and exciting their interest in sustainability. Gib Bulloch, executive director of Accenture Development Partnerships (ADP), a social enterprise spin-off from consultancy firm Accenture, is a big fan. Volunteering opportunities – particularly those that are long-term and skills-based – can act as a \"living laboratory for social innovation\", he says.</p><p>To think out of the box, employees have to live out of the box, he reasons: \"There are lots of examples of where a volunteering programme can get people thinking out of the box and thinking about their skills, their job, their company's products and services and how these might be able to solve a particular problem.\"</p><p>He gives the example of an industrial engineer at UK pharmaceuticals company GSK. The mid-level employee came up with an idea for providing low-cost health diagnostics during a volunteering stint in Kenya. \"It's no surprise that the idea came to him in the slums of Nairobi,\" says Bulloch.</p><p>UPS's Sustainability Ambassador programme is another example. Created to harness the passion of employees who want to make a difference at work, it has enabled more than 4,500 employees around the world to participate in environmental and community volunteer activities and brainstorm ideas for how the company can be more sustainable.</p><p>Appealing to people's competitive instinct is another powerful means of engaging employees. A case in point is the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.leagueofintrapreneurs.com/\" title=\"\">League of Intrapreneurs</a> competition. Launched last year by Standard Chartered and GSK, among others, the initiative invites proposals for business-based solutions to critical sustainability challenges from entrepreneurially minded staff within corporates. It garnered over 230 submissions, of which four were singled out as winners. The organisers hope to set up an \"innovation incubator\" to develop the best of the rest.</p><p>UK-based power firm RWE npower runs a similar competition internally. Employees from across the company are asked to submit ideas for cutting energy use. Winners of the Future Leaders scheme receive funding and mentoring support to run pilots or small-scale projects in their workplace or their local community. GE's Treasure Hunts programme similarly looks to engage employees on energy-efficiency issues. The initiative, which runs at more than 300 facilities, has led to more than $150m in energy savings and the reduction of more than 250,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide.</p><p><strong>Dual benefits</strong><br />Ultimately, the more employees engage with a company's sustainability strategy, the more those plans come to life and the more sustainable that company becomes.</p><p>But the relationship isn't just a one-way affair, notes Andy Savitz, author of Talent, Transformation and the Triple Bottom Line. A growing number of employees today, especially the young, so-called millennial generation, are looking for meaning in their work, says Savitz. \"Employees no longer expect to check their values in at the door,\" he observes.</p><p>The exciting prospect of becoming part of a company's sustainable growth story can provide precisely that kind of pull. As Savitz notes, engaged employees tend to be more motivated, more loyal and more inspired: \"And that's what makes the world go round as far as corporations are concerned.\"</p><p><em>This content is brought to you by Guardian Sustainable Business in association with UPS.

The problem arises when it is not treated correctly and this is a problem in developing countries.</p><p>Despite having highly effective informal networks for recycling, there is often no effective treatment for waste. The most predominant way of dealing with e-waste is to burn it to extract its valuable materials. This causes environmental and health problems. At Dell we are working towards the environmentally-sound management of obsolete electronics. Through our <a href=\"http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/emea/topics/services/recycle_program?c=eu&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen\" title=\"\">Take Back programme</a> we are working to ensure e-waste is collected and reused rather than discarded and burned.</p><p><strong>Is the depiction of developing countries as </strong><a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/12/14/poor-nations-serve-as-e-waste-dumping-ground-says-united-nations/\" title=\"\"><strong>'dumping grounds' </strong></a><strong> for e-waste accurate?</strong></p><p>The view that developing countries are dumping grounds for e-waste is changing.  If you look at the volumes of e-waste in Africa, it is not always the big brand technology companies that are doing the importing, even though it may be their products that end up as waste. Increasingly it is local importers in developing countries who are buying and importing second-hand electronic products from companies in other regions. Developing countries are actually generating more and more of the e-waste themselves.</p><p><strong>Do you think a lack of regulation is behind the problem? </strong></p><p>Latin America and Africa are the main regions that remain unregulated. The big challenge is that there is a lot of e-waste regulation in developing markets, but it is very uncoordinated. When we talk to governments in Africa, one of the things we say is don't reinvent the wheel. Countries just need to tweak legislation so it works for their economy.</p><p>The second issue is that the necessary infrastructure to support the legislation is often absent.  Although you see these horrible pictures of sprawling e-waste in developing countries, not all of these countries have it in a volume that is going to encourage a big recycler to invest in building the necessary infrastructure. This is why we are saying they should work towards regional solutions. Through our work in east Africa we are seeing the first developments in infrastructure happening in Kenya. Let one country, such as Kenya, be the recycling base for other countries.</p><p><strong>Are there any issues around using the term 'waste'?</strong></p><p>The first thing I say when I speak at conferences is to say we have to stop talking about waste as 'waste' and start talking about it as a resource. In many developing countries, particularly those in Africa, the growth of the IT sector is key to development. People are looking for affordable solutions to bridging the digital divide. In Nigeria, we are providing IT access to children via a series of <a href=\"http://africanspotlight.com/2013/07/08/dell-launches-its-first-solar-powered-mobile-classroom-zubabox-in-lagos/\" title=\"\">mobile solar classrooms</a>, made from old shipping containers.</p><p><strong>Many people depend on recycling and sorting e-waste for an income. How do you balance the regulation with the possibility of job loss?</strong></p><p>We feel it is incredibly important that we recognise these jobs and try to formalise the work. The solution is starting out with embracing the informal sector – training those workers and teaching them how to handle e-waste properly. The idea is that you establish the view that all e-waste has value not just the valuable material that comes from burning it. Instead of only being paid for things like copper, informal workers would get paid for everything they collect. We trialled this in Mombasa and in a week collectors were happy to stop burning e-waste.</p><p><strong>What is the biggest misunderstanding about e-waste?</strong></p><p>The big misconception is that the best way of dealing with e-waste is to try and stop the waste coming in to a country, rather than focusing on solutions.</p><p>We've seen a lot of countries ban the import of secondhand products thinking that they are getting 'waste'. This has a serious negative impact. Uganda has formally recognised the impact of this legislation on their ability to bridge the digital divide.</p><p>Our commitment is still not to ship waste, but the most important thing for those countries is solutions. As long as there is a solution for waste, it can be managed: you can create value and you can create jobs.</p><p><em>Jean Cox Kearns is the director of compliance at </em><a href=\"http://www.dell.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Dell</em></a><em>.

Already <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-versus-paypal-comparison-2013-12\" title=\"\">more money is being transacted around the world each day by bitcoin than by Western Union</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/cryptocurrencies\" title=\"\">Cryptocurrencies</a>, and specifically the distributed ledgers that maintain them, are a disruptive technology, in the classic sense of disruptive technologies that begin by appealing to niche markets but have the capacity to scale rapidly and make some of the products and services of incumbents less attractive.</p><p>The current talk is about disruption, and as such, it's fundamentally misguided. We must focus on positive transformation of the relationship between banking and the economy. About 97% of money is created by <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/where-does-money-come-from\" title=\"\">private bank lending</a>, which comes with interest. The amount owed to banks (the amount borrowed plus the interest) is always more than the amount borrowed, and an increase in velocity of the flow of money can't address this fundamental contradiction. The world is facing an environmental crisis and a gross inequality crisis, driven in part by this monetary system, which demands expanding consumption of the environment and a transfer of wealth from poor to rich, to serve interest payments. These twin crises present an existential threat to the current capitalist system. The answer must include different forms of currency and credit that nourish life and community, not exploit them.</p><p>More innovators now realise that the current generation of cryptocurrencies are flawed not only in their code, but in the way they are designed to act like assets. History shows frequently that when the supply of money is tied to a commodity, or the supply can be restricted like a commodity, as is the case with asset-like cryptos, then by buying up or limiting the supply, the rich will <a href=\"http://www.mhpbooks.com/books/debt/\" title=\"\">manipulate the supply of money</a> to the economy in their own interests. But there is a form of money that's not a commodity and not a tool for the rich. These are forms of non-interest bearing collaborative credit.</p><p>Instead of a central authority issuing units of \"money\" into circulation according to a policy or algorithm, with collaborative credit, peers extend credit to each other. This includes systems such as time banks, where members of a system lend support among themselves, using a ledger to balance the units of credit, measured in hours. There are many other collaborative credit projects worldwide, which <a href=\"http://www.cumbria.ac.uk/Courses/Subjects/BusinessComputing/Short/SustainableExchange.aspx\" title=\"\">we study in our course on sustainable exchange</a>, like <a href=\"http://imaginationforpeople.org/en/project/banco-palmas/\" title=\"\">Banco Palmas in Brazil</a>, <a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/socialinnovationeurope/directory/news/time-bank-turkey-zumbara\" title=\"\">Zumbara in Turkey,</a> or <a href=\"http://koru.or.ke/bangla-pesa\" title=\"\">BanglaPesa in Kenya</a>, or the <a href=\"http://cooperativa.cat/en/\" title=\"\">Cooperativa Integral Catalana</a> in Spain. Online business barter (B2B) exchanges such as <a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/Recipco_Capacity_Exchange\" title=\"\">Recipco</a> help companies trade their spare capacity without money changing hands.</p><p>These initiatives are collaborative, as both issuance and redemption of the currency relies on freely collaborating citizens or firms, and enable economic collaboration when there isn't sufficient national money in circulation to complete a transaction or reward an activity. Outside agencies cannot limit the amount of credit available, as collaborative credit simply requires members of a network to trust each other rather than a bank. Collaborative credit isn't scarce like conventional currencies, and doesn't come with interest demands. The credit is as abundant as the pervasiveness of trust in a community or business network, as it is created in the very act of sharing, caring or trading.</p><p>Two of the most interesting collaborative credit systems are <a href=\"https://ripple.com/\" title=\"\">Ripple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.community-exchange.org/\" title=\"\">Community Exchange Systems</a>. The former is known to the payment innovation field, as it has attracted private investment. The latter is an entirely non-profit community affair. Their software developer, Matthew Slater, reports they have<a href=\"http://cointelegraph.com/news/111833/what_happens_after_the_crypto_revolution\" title=\"\"> 50,000 (more or less active) users, in 600 LETS and time bank projects worldwide</a>. Each group has its own currency and manages its own credit limits – which means local sovereignty, yet the shared infrastructure means transactions are possible between the communities. These initiatives shows how collaborative credit systems will increasingly use innovations made famous by cryptocurrencies, such as distributed ledgers.</p><p>It is time to support and scale innovations in payments, currencies and credit systems that are compatible with, and support, a restored environment, thriving real economy and social cohesion.

Growing faster than almost any other segment of the tech industry, global investment in the sector <a href=\"http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/global-fin-tech-investment-accenture\" title=\"\">reached nearly $3bn last year</a>. As well as bumper profits for investors, fintech innovations hold out hope for major social returns too. We look at innovative ideas in areas where opportunity for impact is ripe.</p><h2>Banking the unbanked</h2><p>Africa is home to the largest unbanked population on the planet. Four in five adult Africans do not use formal banking services. In Ethiopia, the rate is even lower, with as many as 90% of people unbanked.</p><p>Addis Ababa-based financial technology firm <a href=\"http://kifiya.com/\" title=\"\">Kifiya</a> is working to change that. Established in 2010, the start-up has worked with the government to set up a unified billing system called Lehulu. The system automatically collates electricity, water and landline phone charges into one single bill. Householders in Addis Ababa can pay their primary utility bills altogether in one of 31 centres that Kifiya operates across the capital city.</p><p>Kifiya also offers a branchless banking service enabling unbanked customers to conduct basic transactions. The system, which is accessed via a registered card or biometric data, relies on itinerant agents visiting communities with a specially tailored internet-enabled hardware device. A Little World's <a href=\"http://www.alittleworld.com/htmls/zero/platform.html\" title=\"\">Zero platform</a> and <a href=\"http://www.finopaytech.com/\" title=\"\">FINO PayTech</a> offer similar branchless banking services in rural India.</p><h2>Mobile payments</h2><p>Mobile phone-based paying is where a lot of the action is at these days. Mobile phone ownership is high in countries such as Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania, where Vodafone's national subsidiaries operate the hugely successful <a href=\"http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/about/about-us/money_transfer.html\" title=\"\">M-Pesa mobile payments service</a>. <a href=\"http://www.wizzit.co.za/\" title=\"\">Wizzit</a> in South Africa and <a href=\"http://www.globe.com.ph/gcash\" title=\"\">GCash</a> in the Philippines demonstrate how fast the mobile money market is developing.</p><p>Mobile payments are sparking associated innovations too. Take the <a href=\"http://m-ledger.com/\" title=\"\">M-ledger app</a>, for example. The brainchild of two amateur programmers from Kenya, the app scans SMS messages sent by M-Pesa to confirm transfers and then collates these on an onscreen dashboard. The service enables M-Pesa users to manage their payments more fully, checking them by date, amount and recipient.</p><p>Payment problems aren't just a developing world phenomenon, 23% of US transactions by value are made in cash. Some use cash because of concerns about digital security and online fraud. Others simply can't afford the charges associated with banks and credit cards. Alternatively, they may well lack the documentation or credit history necessary to open a bank account.</p><p>California-based <a href=\"http://www.paynearme.com/en\" title=\"\">PayNearMe</a> enables consumers to pay their rent remotely, make purchases online and make other transactions that have typically become electronic. Equipped with a PayNearMe Card or PaySlip, cash users simply need to enter one of the 17,000 participating 7-Eleven, Family Dollar and ACE Cash Express stores and make their payment.</p><p>Using a proprietary embedded barcode technology, the cash is transferred automatically to the biller's account. The approach avoids the need for costly and complex money orders, as well as reducing the labour costs and fraud risks associated with collecting cash on-site.</p><h2>Disability and financial services</h2><p>Lack of banking infrastructure prevents many from accessing banking services, but it's not the only barrier. Disability can act as an obstacle to financial inclusion too.</p><p>Blindness is the most obvious case in point. Blind or partially sighted customers face difficulties reading the screens on cash machines. Back in 2012, UK bank Barclays responded by equipping more than 3,500 of its ATMs with <a href=\"https://www.yourbank.barclays.co.uk/t5/Your-ideas-brought-to-life/Audio-cash-machines-Now-we-re-talking/ba-p/8\" title=\"\">audio instructions</a>, which individuals with sight difficulties can listen to via a set of headphones. The bank also issues high visibility bankcards to facilitate their use at ATMs and with chip and pin devices.</p><p>In rural regions of India, the barriers are more educational than physical. Many are either entirely illiterate or unable to read Hindi or English, the country's primary administrative languages. Chennai-based <a href=\"http://www.vortexindia.co.in/\" title=\"\">Vortex Engineering</a> has designed an ATM that seeks to overcome these problems by using fingerprint authentication and multi-language screens in regional languages. The system is widely used by the State Bank of India.</p><p>To increase its suitability to rural conditions even further, Vortex's Gramteller Duo cashpoint is also designed to be energy efficient (requiring less than 100 watts) and heat tolerant (operating in temperature up to 50C). Vortex has a second design – the Ecoteller – that can be powered by solar energy.</p><h2>Aggregating aids</h2><p>Online trading platforms have made us all (potential) stockbrokers now. That said, we still need to do the laborious work of identifying the right stocks to buy. For sustainability-minded private investors, the challenge is more taxing still as the relevant data is often hard to find or tricky to decipher.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.motifinvesting.com/\" title=\"\">Motif Investing</a> runs a low-cost trading platform that promises to take the hassle out of stock selection. The California firm has compiled over 100 ready-made, professionally built portfolios (or 'motifs) linked around specific themes or ideas.</p><p>Most are fairly conventional. If you want to know what stocks will benefit from trends in private equity or the boom in online gaming then Motif offers a list to pick from. But sustainability gets a look in too. Among the options on offer are portfolios linked around the smart grid, water shortage, 'fossil free' and income inequality. The latest monthly return on Motif's <a href=\"https://www.motifinvesting.com/motifs/socially-responsible#/overview\" title=\"\">socially responsible</a> portfolio is 4.3% - half a percentage point above the company's <a href=\"https://www.motifinvesting.com/motifs/seven-deadly-sins#/overview\" title=\"\">Seven Deadly Sins</a> selection.</p><p>Technology is helping pool donor cash, not just investor finance. <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/yimby\" title=\"\">Yimby</a> provides an illustrative example. The brainchild of UK employee-giving advocate JustGiving, the service provides a platform for communities to crowdfund for local projects. Over 700 projects have so far been funded through Yimby, which charges a 5% fee for successful projects.</p><p><em>The finance hub is funded by EY.

Here are 10 things we learned:</p><h2>1. We shouldn't just \"accept\" climate change</h2><p>Just because climate change is happening and its effects are already being felt, we shouldn't give up on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural GHG emissions, make up about 25% of global GHG emissions, but there's a lot that can be done to reduce this.</p><p>Richard Waite, associate, Food, Forests and Water Program, <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/\" title=\"\">World Resources Institute</a> explains: \"By intensifying agriculture on existing land and protecting the remaining forests, we can eliminate emissions from land-use change. And by addressing key emissions from agricultural production – from cows and other ruminants, from fertilizers, and from rice production practices, we can greatly reduce emissions from agricultural production.\"</p><h2>2. We don't need to \"accept\" a world with 9.6 billion people by 2050</h2><p>The world population is growing, but fertility rates have fallen rapidly over the last few decades as girls gain better access to education and reproductive health services. African governments have made health and education a priority but greater investment could reduce the population challenge and the demand for food.</p><p>This is especially important in sub-Saharan Africa where half of population growth between now and 2050 will occur. A <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/publication/achieving-replacement-level-fertility\" title=\"\">recent report from WRI</a> estimates that achieving replacement level fertility (the rate of fertility at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next) in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050 would reduce food demand by around 600tn kilocalories (kcal) per year by the mid-century. This would close 9% of the 6,500tn kcal per year global gap between food available in 2006 and food needed in 2050.</p><h2>3. Switching crops is the future</h2><p>Emphasis will be on climate smart agriculture in the short-term, but in 10 to 20 years time, the focus will be on switching crops, says Jason Clay, senior vice president, market transformation, <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">WWF</a>. As climate change affects commercial crops, alternatives will have to be sought out. Clay points that sorghum is already being substituted for corn and maize because it can be used in feed and produce like beer. In Mexico, the government is looking to varieties of cocoa to replace coffee crops, which may not be suitable to grow by 2025 due to blight and heat as a consequence of climate change.</p><p>With the right technical assistance and packages of better genetics, management practice and inputs, switching crops could be an opportunity for smaller farmers struggling with current crops to leapfrog previous performance and become more productive.</p><h2>4. Research breakthroughs need more investment</h2><p>Moving to adapted crop varieties that are more resilient to climate change is feasible, says Chris Brown, general manager for environmental sustainability, at agri-business <a href=\"http://olamgroup.com/\" title=\"\">Olam International</a>. But for the next wave of research breakthroughs, the FAO has estimated that we will need $45-$50bn annual spending globally. It's currently at $4bn.</p><h2>5. Cultivating trees on farms can boost crop yields</h2><p>According to Waite, over the last few decades, farmers in Niger have managed the natural regrowth of native Faidherbia trees across 5m hectares. The Faidherbia fixes nitrogen in the soil, protects fields from wind and water erosion and contributes organic matter to soils when its leaves drop. Compared to conventional farms in the country, yields of maize in these agroforestry systems can be doubled and farmers in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Zambia are taking note.</p><h2>6. Small-scale farmers are vital to domestic food security</h2><p>Small-scale farmers have a guaranteed and growing market for staple crops, but the UK produces 24% less food than it consumes, says Charles Tassell, farmer and co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.agrichatuk.org/\" title=\"\">AgriChatUK</a>. This comes today, as MPs warn that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/01/uk-food-security-threatened-complacency-mps-report\" title=\"\">UK's ability to feed itself is threatened by complacency</a>. Over the last 20 years, the UK's self-sufficiency for domestically-grown food has fallen from 87% to 68%, while yields of its most important staple crop, wheat, have not increased for at least the last 15 years.</p><p>Brown argues that governments, banks and companies must coordinate to support the 500m global smallholders to scale-up agri-production enterprises. This support should include legal land tenure, global policies for a level playing field, access to capital and markets, structured training (both agriculture and business development), and investment in technology and infrastructure.</p><h2>7. Urban farms suit tomatoes, not cows</h2><p>If urban farmers reduce the need for transport, refrigeration and packaging, and source inputs from local waste streams, then city farms could offer a sustainable alternative for growing fruit and vegetables, says Oscar Rodriguez, director of <a href=\"http://www.architectureandfood.com/\" title=\"\">Architecture and Food</a>. However, livestock farming and urban living make a less practical combination.</p><h2>8. Meat is off the menu</h2><p>Achieving replacement level fertility, reducing food loss and waste, reducing biofuel demand for food crops and shifting our diets, will all go some way to closing the gap between food available and food required. Any meaningful change to consumption patterns and the environmental impacts of food production though, will have to involve knocking animal products off the menu, especially beef. Chris Hunt, director of GRACE's food program, points to consumer campaigns like <a href=\"http://www.meatlessmonday.com/\" title=\"\">Meatless Monday</a> as evidence of trending in the right direction.</p><h2>9. The definition of a \"good\" farmer is culturally complex</h2><p>What is good criteria for one person, may be shocking for another, says <a href=\"http://www.rau.ac.uk/the-rau/academic-staff-profiles/school-of-agriculture/louise-manning\" title=\"\">Louise Manning</a>, senior lecturer in food production management, Royal Agricultural University. In terms of animal welfare, stocking density might be considered an indicator of negative performance but in terms of resource management, a positive one.</p><h2>10. Everyone has a role to play</h2><p>The WRI report on <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/publication/creating-sustainable-food-future-interim-findings\">Creating a Sustainable Food Future</a> estimates that we need about 70% more food in 2050 than we have today in order to provide every one of the 9.6 billion world population with a daily intake of 3,000 calories. It's a huge challenge, but unlike other sustainability challenges, everyone can play a part in the solution.</p><p>Everyone needs to eat, so be it reducing food loss and waste, eating lower-impact diets or investing in sustainable production - countries, companies, and consumers can make a difference. Surrounded by abundance, the challenge is making consumers care. On this, Liz Bowles, head of farming at the <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/\">Soil Association</a>, points out that if everyone tried to grow their own vegetables it would bring home just how difficult food production is.</p><p><em>The food hub is funded by The Irish Food Board.

In Tanzania, these partners are also enabling smallholder rice farmers to participate in the country's warehouse receipt system, which is designed to increase incomes by ensuring fair prices for farm products.</p><p>UN agencies and private sector partners are also coming together in support of the shared vision of zero hunger, enhancing existing programmes and stimulating novel initiatives. Initiated in 2011, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fao.org/save-food/savefood/en/\" title=\"\">Save Food global initiative on loss and waste</a> – a partnership between FAO, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Messe Düsseldorf – works in collaboration with both public- and private-sector partners from the food packaging industry. The project focuses  on minimising food losses incurred in developing countries during harvest, processing, transportation and storage as a result of inadequate infrastructure and technology.</p><h2><strong>United Nations Development Programme, (UNDP)</strong></h2><p>With a presence in more than 170 countries worldwide, UNDP has long considered the private sector to be an integral partner in its efforts that advance sustainable and human development.</p><p>UNDP supports many countries in managing their extractive sectors for human development and also helps companies to align their corporate social responsibility investments and core business operations with national and global development priorities. In Colombia, UNDP works in communities near oil exploration sites by building capacity for local development, including access to safe drinking water and improved food security.</p><p>Through the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/environmentandenergy/projects_and_initiatives/green-commodities-facility/\" title=\"\">Green Commodities Program</a>, UNDP works to remove bottlenecks and strengthen competitiveness in agricultural value chains. Pivotal to its success is UNDP's collaboration with private sector partners including, Mondelez, IKEA, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Walmart, Tesco, Dole, Chiquita and Del Monte. Currently in eight countries, initiatives focus on key sectors, including coffee in Colombia, cocoa in Ghana, pineapples in Costa Rica and palm oil in Indonesia. UNDP brings together national governments, large international purchasers, local producers and others to strengthen each commodity's value chain.</p><p>UNDP is also working with the UK Department for International Development (DFID), to elicit private sector solutions for sustainable development, and has recently launched the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://micf.mw/\" title=\"\">Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund</a>, a $8m fund for agricultural and manufacturing companies seeking support for novel projects that deliver large social impact and help the country diversify its exports.</p><p>In addition, UNDP hosts the secretariat of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.businesscalltoaction.org/\" title=\"\">Business Call to Action</a> (BCtA), a global membership platform that encourages private companies to develop innovative business models that combine profitability with development impact. More than 90 companies have already responded to the BCtA by making tangible commitments to improve the lives and livelihoods of millions. BCtA challenges its members to develop commercially-viable business ventures that engage low-income people as consumers, producers, suppliers and distributors of goods and services. The latest companies to answer the call include inclusive business initiatives from H&amp;M, MUJI, and L'Occitane, as well as smaller enterprises like Datawind and Sproxil.</p><h2><strong>UN Global Compact</strong></h2><p>By all accounts, the private sector is increasingly shifting its development perspective from philanthropy towards a more focused approach to core business.</p><p>The <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://businesspartnershiphub.org/\" title=\"\">UN Global Compact Business Partnership Hub</a> was recently launched as an interactive, online platform designed to connect businesses with potential partners in support of UN goals and issues. Companies and other organisations can find new partners for their projects, or join existing projects, in the areas of anti-corruption, climate and energy, social enterprise and water. The site allows organisations to connect with potential partners in the UN system. More than 300 organisations are already connecting online through over 250 projects. For example, to inspire more innovative business models and advance collaborative efforts in developing market-based responses to sustainability issues the Social Enterprise Action Hub has to date helped forge 34 projects by 22 companies operating in 19 countries. Global Compact signatories including Intel, Yara, Enel and SK have developed innovative projects and are seeking partners in the areas of technology, food security, and last-mile energy distribution.</p><h2><strong>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, (UNHCR)</strong></h2><p>As the number of humanitarian emergencies continues to grow, UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has been inspired by the private sector to develop best practices and leverage cost-effective solutions for vulnerable and displaced persons. In order to provide refugee housing in Ethiopia, Iraq and Lebanon, UNHCR partnered with the Ikea Foundation and others to create a modular refugee shelter designed to last up to three years. These steel housing units are built with waterproof materials that are heat and flame resistant. The agency is also working with entrepreneurs from Ashoka, the world's largest network of social entrepreneurs, to improve the often complicated refugee resettlement and referral process, and to empower displaced communities.</p><h2><strong>United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, (UNIDO)</strong></h2><p>As the business community's approach to development evolves, UNIDO is promoting industrial development for poverty reduction, inclusive growth and environmental sustainability. A joint program with Volvo and the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) is providing specialised training in Ethiopia for machinery and commercial vehicle technicians. Launched in 2012, the project aims to prepare young people for future livelihoods and facilitate access to employment opportunities.</p><p>UNIDO also works with German retailer Metro Group and Aeon in Malaysia to link diverse actors in supply chains. The Metro partnership, which began in 2009, has since rolled out to other countries including Russia and India. It provides training to upgrade the skills of its many suppliers and increase the volume of saleable merchandise in Egypt. Local processors of fresh foods like fish, meat and dairy products are trained in hygiene and food safety during storage, transport and processing. This helps to reduce post-harvest losses, increase the volume of marketable products and boost the producers' income.</p><h2><strong>United Nations Secretariat</strong></h2><p>The Secretary-General's office has taken the innovative approach of helping public and private sector actors to collaborate on a number of critical programs designed to reduce poverty and generate economic growth. These multi-stakeholder initiatives and influential movements include, Every Woman Every Child (EWEC), Sustainable Energy for All, Scaling Up Nutrition, Global Education First and Call to Action on Sanitation.</p><p>The EWEC movement began in 2010 with the goal of saving the lives of 16 million women and children by 2015. Private sector partners like Johnson &amp; Johnson have been on the frontlines of this initiative, committing $4m over four years to support H4+, a joint effort by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), UN Women, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank. Since 2008, H4+ has improved the health and saved the lives of many women and children. Its activities include building capacity for improved healthcare and training skilled birth attendants in Tanzania and Ethiopia.</p><p>Another vital private sector partner in the EWEC effort is the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which has made a 10-year commitment with UNICEF to provide 300m doses of the pneumococcal vaccine to infants and young children in the poorest countries at a deeply discounted price.</p><h2><strong>UN Women</strong></h2><p>Just this month, the UN agency focused on promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women and announced the formation of a private sector leadership advisory council. The council is comprised of 10 founding corporate members, including the CEOs of Coca-Cola, Unilever, and L'Oreal, who will focus on women's economic empowerment, ending violence against women and resource mobilisation for the agency.</p><p>The members were selected to represent companies that have a global presence and have demonstrated a strong commitment to supporting women and girls issues.</p><h2><strong>World Food Programme, (WFP)</strong></h2><p>WFP is building a world with zero hunger. To help get there, the UN agency partners with private companies such as Unilever and DSM to improve operations, raise funds and better provide the nutritious food that can transform lives. WFP also partners with local farmers who often lack access to stable markets and financing by purchasing the food they grow at a fair price.</p><p>In addition to providing food in emergencies and operating the world's largest school meals programme, WFP is developing long-term strategies to help tackle food insecurity and climate change. Among the agency's many programmes is R4, a rural resilience initiative that uses micro-insurance to help farmers manage risk, which often costs far less than rebuilding after a crisis or extreme weather event. The programme is backed by reinsurer Swiss Re and gives farmers the option of paying their insurance premiums through labour instead of cash.</p><h2><strong>World Intellectual Property Organization, (WIPO)</strong></h2><p>Innovative insights can come in many forms, but especially through sharing knowledge. To facilitate the global dissemination of green technologies, WIPO launched the interactive platform <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://webaccess.wipo.int/green/\" title=\"\">GREEN–The Marketplace for Sustainable Technology</a>.&nbsp;GREEN aims to facilitate the networking of institutions with complementary expertise, which helps developing countries to share in global innovations around green technologies. So far, 1,000 technologies have been introduced on the platform from companies such as General Electric, Hitachi, Honda Motor Co., INDIA IMPEX, Schneider Electric, Sony and Teijin, and from many universities and technology- transfer offices. The initiative is being implemented in partnership with over 40 institutions.</p><p>These efforts represent just a few examples of the opportunities for private sector collaboration which is an essential aspect of long-term strategies for eradicating poverty.</p><p><em>Launched at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.un.org/\">United Nations</a>, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.businesscalltoaction.org/\">Business Call to Action</a> (BCtA) is a global alliance hosted by the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.undp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Nations Development Programme</a> Headquarters in New York.

Central to this will be optimising the shaker design and materials, and seeking manufacturing and distribution partners.</p><p>\"I hope to encourage maximum take-up by developing an assembly kit, so children can build their own shaker,\" explains Kheterpal. \"In the long-term, I'd like to reach children learning about kinetic and renewable energy in Africa, India and Brazil.\"</p><p>While Kheterpal and her team seek to bring a creative, educational solution to a very real development need, they will face some steep challenges to bring the initiative to scale. Gaining sufficient investment will be fundamental, as will defining exactly how the project could be sustained for the long-term in a way that responds effectively to the needs of users and protects the environment. Affordability will be critical, and moreover, will people embrace the idea of producing energy themselves?</p><p>\"The shaker has promise for low energy applications such as low power lights and limited charging of mobile phones,\" says Ioannis Kymissis, associate professor of electrical engineering at New York's Columbia University.</p><p>Anne Wheldon, renewable energy expert and Ashden adviser says:\" When tackling a pressing development need, it's vital to engage with people on the ground to understand what they want.</p><p>\"Shaking a musical instrument may be fun and engaging initially, but its success will ultimately be determined by whether children want to use it for the long-term. It must also be simple and cost-effective to distribute and repair, and commercially viable for the manufacturer to offer warranties.\"</p><p>She said investors and grant-makers would look at how a kinetic energy harvesting solution performs compared to an equivalent competitor solution. \"With solar innovations now starting to reach scale, any initiative seeking to harness energy from human activity would need to perform at least as well in order to attract serious funding.\"</p><p>The shaker is one of many kinetic products emerging to solve the energy crisis. A product design firm Unchartered Play raised $92,200 (£54,328) in March 2014 to manufacture and distribute the <a href=\"http://www.sporttechie.com/2013/07/01/energy-harnessing-soccer-ball-provides-electricity-for-off-grid-communities/\" title=\"\">Soccet</a>, a football that converts kinetic energy into electricity via a pendulum-like mechanism, powering an LED light for three hours after 30 minutes of play.</p><p>\"Various kinetic energy projects have been introduced in Africa over time, but none of these has taken off at scale,\" says Brenda Martin of the World Future Council. \"Aspiration for energy security in Africa generally continues to be for a conventional, 'flick of a switch' supply. However, if small-scale innovations boost the local economy, use good quality components, change children's quality of life and are affordable, they can play a role in promoting energy access.\"</p><p>The Kenyan schools visited by Kheterpal taught pupils about renewable energy but lacked a way to demonstrate it. Providing pupils with shaker assembly kits could help them to put theory into practice, their teachers concurred. And this could also inspire confidence in the benefits of other renewable technologies, according to Wim Jonker Klunne, senior renewable energy researcher at the CSIR.</p><p>\"The percussion shaker may prove of more interest from an educational perspective,\" says Klunne. \"It's great to help children understand how energy is generated, and show them that small amounts of energy can bring big improvements to life.\"</p><p>As work continues to deliver a permanent, affordable electricity supply for all in Africa, kinetic energy solutions can provide a sustainable alternative to kerosene lamps for low energy needs. A few extra hours of LED-powered light saves people money, reduces their exposure to smoky fumes and provides valuable time to work, study or innovate. Above all, innovations like the percussion shaker can be used to bring renewable energy to life for the next generation of Africans, shining a light on the possibilities for a clean, secure energy future.</p><p><strong>Read more stories like this: </strong></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/quiz/2014/jun/05/renewable-energy-what-do-you-know\"

More than two-thirds of refugees are in <a href=\"http://www.prsproject.org/\" title=\"\">protracted exile</a> for at least five years, often in closed camps and without the right to work or move freely.</p><p>Current approaches often fail to recognise that refugees have skills, talents and aspirations. Despite the constraints placed on people, vibrant economic systems often thrive below the radar, whether in the formal or informal economy.</p><p>In Uganda, where we've done our initial research, refugee policies are by no means perfect. But, unlike many other host states, it has a <a href=\"https://icvanetwork.org/system/files/versions/doc00003299.pdf\" title=\"\">self-reliance strategy</a> and allows refugees the right to work. We surveyed 1,600 refugees in Kampala and two rural refugee settlements to understand refugees' economic lives, including their engagement with the private sector and the ways in which they use technology. Our results challenge five myths about refugees.</p><h2>1) Refugees are economically isolated</h2><p>Refugee economies are part of complex systems that go beyond their communities and the boundaries of particular settlements. Refugees trade across nationality groups and across international borders. Maize grown in settlements is exported across borders to neighbouring countries. Congolese jewellery and textiles are imported from as far as India and China. Somali shops import tuna from Thailand, via the Middle East and Kenya.</p><h2>2) Refugees are a burden on host states</h2><p>Refugees make active contributions to the host economy. Many Ugandan business people acknowledge relying upon the presence of refugees. One fruit farmer told us: \"It is hard to imagine Kyangwali's economy without the refugees' presence.\" Refugees buy and sell goods and services from and to Ugandan nationals. Many also create job opportunities for others, including by employing Ugandan nationals. In Kampala, 21% of the refugees surveyed employ others, and of those, 40% employ Ugandans.</p><h2>3) Refugees are economically homogenous</h2><p>Although there are a range of traditional income-generating activities such as farming in rural areas and running shops and restaurants, we found huge diversity. In the settlements, we found Congolese cinemas, a Somali computer games parlour using recycled consoles and televisions and innovative businesses in areas such as transportation and maize milling that have scaled and often employ others. Even among farmers, income levels vary massively, with huge deviation around the mean of $29 per month.</p><h2>4) Refugees are technology illiterate</h2><p>Many refugees use technology, including mobile phones and the internet, for income-generating activities, often at higher levels than the national population. In Kampala, 96% use mobile phones and 30%  use them for money transfers as part of their primary livelihood strategy. Many refugees also adapt their own appropriate technologies, engaging in forms of <a href=\"http://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/publications/the-two-worlds-of-humanitarian-innovation\" title=\"\">\"bottom-up innovation\"</a>, often recycling whatever is available to create an entrepreneurial opportunity.</p><h2>5) Refugees are dependent on humanitarian assistance</h2><p>Refugees are far from uniformly dependent on international assistance. Nearly all – 99% – of rural refugee households said they had at least some form of independent income-generating activity. When they were asked what kind of assistance they wanted, financial assistance did not come out top. Instead, opportunities for autonomy – including education, business training and resettlement – were valued highly.</p><p>This data is just a starting point, drawn from one country. More comparative research on the economic lives of refugees and other displaced populations is needed, including in less auspicious regulatory environments. One of the keys to our work was its participatory approach; our team included refugee research assistants, drawn from the different communities. This approach took more time and money than many quick surveys often used in development work. However, it enabled us to build trust, acquire better access and to leave a legacy in terms of training.</p><p>Although our findings are preliminary, we believe they have significant policy implications. They highlight the value of a market-based approach. Rather than assuming dependency, we need to build upon what there is to understand better refugee economies as complex systems, work to improve those markets and to empower refugees to engage better with those markets.</p><p>The key to this is helping refugees to help themselves. Refugees are not just passive victims. While many are in need of protection and assistance, it is important to recognise that they have capacities as well as vulnerabilities. Interventions might better nurture such capacities through, for instance, improving education, access to microcredit, business incubation and improved internet access. If we recognise and understand refugee economies, we may be able gradually to turn humanitarian challenges into more sustainable opportunities.</p><p><em>Alexander Betts is associate professor in </em><a href=\"http://www.oxhip.org/\" title=\"\"><em>refugee and forced migration studies at the University of Oxford</em></a><em>. </em></p><p><strong>Read more stories like this: </strong></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jul/15/world-refugee-day-refugees\" title=\"\">From Syria to Central African Republic, how to invest in refugees</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jan/04/refugees-camp-innovation-creativity\" title=\"\">Put innovation at the heart of refugee protection work</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/17/world-refugee-day-refugee-camps\" title=\"\">World Refugee Day: is it time to invest in refugee camps?</a></p><p><strong>Join the community of global development professionals and experts. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\" title=\"\"><strong>Become a GDPN member</strong></a><strong> to get more stories like this direct to your inbox</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/19/1403185591236/A-Syrian-woman-carries-he-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/20/refugee-myths-uganda-economy-research","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/20/refugee-myths-uganda-economy-research","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"Ten global R&amp;D projects that are changing arts and culture","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-20T08:50:00Z","sectionId":"culture-professionals-network","id":"culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/jun/20/global-research-development-projects-arts-culture","fields":{"body":"<p>Research and Development (R&amp;D) projects can provide arts organisations with a robust framework that brings arts, technology and rigorous research together to test how they might engage with audiences in new ways or test new business models. Because arts funding is limited and resources are stretched, it's vital to publicly share the results of our experiments with one another. This includes our successes <em>and</em> our mistakes – so that others can learn from them and innovate further.</p><p><a href=\"http://artsdigitalrnd.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Digital R&amp;D Fund for the Arts</a> has supported digital projects across the UK and we're beginning to publish the findings and insights from these on our website and magazine. But innovation in the arts goes beyond our borders. With the help of the British Council's <a href=\"http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/\" title=\"\">Creative Economy team</a>, we've scanned the globe for projects that are using digital technologies in new and inspiring ways.</p><p>Here are 10 of our favourites:</p><h2>Lightwave (US)</h2><p><a href=\"http://news.lightwave.io/post/78998579427/introducing-lightwave-where-art-meets-data\" title=\"\">Lightwave</a> is a piece of wearable technology that gathers real-time data about its wearer, including temperature, movement and audio levels, and feeds this back to performers. Through live visualisations of the data from the crowd, the performers get real insights about the audience's experience, giving them the opportunity to change tact to ensure an interactive performance.</p><h2>World Online Orchestra (Denmark and Canada)</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.copenhagenphil.dk/\" title=\"\">World Online Orchestra</a> is helping to bring chamber music to everyone's door. The interactive platform allows users to listen to the 40 members of the Copenhagen Phil perform a piece of music together, or mix and match up to five performers to create their own sound. Users can currently conduct the digital orchestra but will soon be able to upload their own recordings and perform virtually alongside them as well.</p><h2>Culture Shift Africa (Egypt, South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria)</h2><p><a href=\"http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/creative-entrepreneurship/culture-shift/\" title=\"\">Culture Shift</a> is a season of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2013/feb/01/culture-hack-culture-professionals-technology\" title=\"\">hack days</a> that bring together creative businesses and digital talent to make new products that address existing challenges in the cultural sector in just 48 hours. Culture Shift has so far taken place across Africa, Russia and Brazil. In Kenya, one of the hack days resulted in a fashion label that allows customers to input to the design process and a project that uses QR codes to spread the stories behind street art in Nairobi.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio\" title=\"\">Rijksstudio</a> (Netherlands)</h2><p>A platform where 150,000 digitised artworks from the <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en\" title=\"\">Rijksmuseum's</a> collection are available to the public to view, download and turn into new products such as wallpaper and iPad cases. Users not only get to play designer but also entrepreneur with the studio setting up pop-up physical stores for the products made, as well as a partnership with online marketplace Etsy.</p><h2>iBeacons at Rubens House (Belgium)</h2><p><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">The Rubens House</a> in Antwerp is using <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/nov/11/apple-ibeacons-retail\" title=\"\">iBeacon technology</a> to push contextual information to visitors based on their exact location in the museum. This low-cost, low-power technology is used to notify visitors of the stories behind paintings they are viewing, available X-ray scans of the artwork, interactive trivia questions and more. Unlike \"pull\" technologies, which require visitors to initiate interaction, such as scanning a QR code, this new model hopes to better integrate the digital and physical experience.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-454061877'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/20/1403253576064/iBeacon-technology-in-act-009.jpg' alt='iBeacon technology in action at The Rubens House' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>iBeacon technology in action at The Rubens House</figcaption></figure><h2><a href=\"http://www.watershed.co.uk/playablecity/recife/about/programme/\" title=\"\">Recife: The Playable City</a> (Brazil)</h2><p>This Watershed/British Council's Creative Economy project brings together artists, technologists and creative entrepreneurs from Brazil and the UK and invites them to experiment with the idea of the \"playful city\". Installations that have come out of the project range from an interactive commute featuring bus stops that speak back to you, to interactive lighting that marks pick-up points for river taxis on the Capibaribe river.</p><h2>The Digital Museum (Romania)</h2><p>This <a href=\"http://claudiuionescu.ro/\" title=\"\">state-of-the-art museum</a> in Pecica, a remote village in Romania, relies exclusively on 3D and other digital technologies and lets visitors explore other museums and their content around the world. An advantage is that the museum can host any presentation or exhibition without the need of a very large space, large number of staff or substantial maintenance costs. On a more local scale it also gives visitors the opportunity to explore the local area on a virtual bike tour or by renting one of the museum's physical ones.</p><h2>Chess (Greece and France)</h2><p>The Acropolis Museum in Athens together with the Cité de l'Espace, a science centre in Toulouse, is experimenting with providing personalised storytelling for visitors based on their exhibitions. Beyond the development phase, visitors will be invited to download an app and complete a profile for themselves, which will develop a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/apr/04/story-augmented-reality-technology-museums\" title=\"\">story-led route around the museum</a> that uncovers hidden layers of relevant information to them during their visit. For example, according to age, gender or occupation. The tool, which is funded by the European Union, is designed to encourage interaction and engagement.</p><h2>Musica Viva Interactive Whiteboard (Australia)</h2><p>Australia's oldest independent professional performing arts organisation, <a href=\"http://www.musicaviva.com.au/\" title=\"\">Musica Viva</a>, has developed an interactive whiteboard and several digital learning resources to make school music education more fun. There are also singing exercises to understand the connection between lyrics and notation, as well as drag-and-drop combinations of sounds and instruments, to help students and teachers learn about the elements of music and develop skills in listening, singing, playing, moving and composition.</p><h2>Beyond Digital (Morocco)</h2><p><a href=\"http://beyond-digital.org/BYNDDGTL/\" title=\"\">Beyond Digital</a> is a crowdfunded research and skill-sharing programme that explores how local musicians can utilise global digital technologies, such as how Auto-Tune's robotic vocal effects can be used in traditional Berber folk music. Through video, digital media workshops and public performances young people have been invited to experiment and introduce alternatives to western concepts of digital literacy.</p><p><em>Emma Quinn is senior programme manager and Athina Balopoulou is a researcher at </em><a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Nesta</em></a></p><p><strong>Join our community of arts, culture and creative professionals by signing up free to the </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/culture-professionals/register/\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Culture Pros Network</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/19/1403195069515/The-Digital-Museum-in-Pec-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/jun/20/global-research-development-projects-arts-culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/jun/20/global-research-development-projects-arts-culture","sectionName":"Culture professionals network"},{"webTitle":"Laura Weightman: 'I'm a shoe girl. I absolutely love shoes'","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-20T07:30:00Z","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","id":"lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2014/jun/20/friday-flyer-laura-weightman","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>What's your favourite place to run? </strong>My favourite place in the UK is in Leeds actually, where I train and I'm based. There's a place called Eccup Reservoir, in <a href=\"http://www.leeds.gov.uk/leisure/Pages/Golden-Acre-Park.aspx\">Golden Acre Park</a>, I do a beautiful long run up there - but I love actually running when we are away in Kenya, a fantastic place to be and train and there are so many routes out there. Me and <a href=\"http://eilishmccolgan.blogspot.co.uk/\">Eilish McColgan</a>, the steeplechaser, discovered – well, Mo taught us – Farah's Seven as we call it! And that's a great route.</p><p><strong>Do you remember your first ever race? </strong> I don't remember my first <em>ever</em> race but I remember when I was younger, when I was about 12, one of my first races in the local area cross-country at Alnwick Castle. I've got a picture of me when I was running and I don't look much different now, to be honest … We ran that every year with school and it's a fantastic backdrop – you can't really forget running there.</p><p><strong>When someone asks you for a training tip, what do you tell them? </strong> I think it depends on what they are asking me, but I think the most important thing for any runner is to enjoy it. And for you to want to keep doing it, you've got to enjoy it. I think one of the best tips I can give someone if they want to get better, is to join a local running group, because having people around you keeps you motivated. That's what keeps you going and you make great friends doing it. If you're meeting friends it's also quite a social event as well, and you can have a chat, a catchup – it's not about being the best in the world, it's about achieving <em>your</em> goals, and I think you can do that in that kind of environment.</p><p><strong>Do you like a running gadget?</strong> I do! I like my running watches, I like this one [brandishes Garmin on wrist] but I'm a shoe girl really. I absolutely love shoes. I recently just moved house, and I'm coming out of the house with all these boxes and my mum is like \"Laura! Do you really need all of these?\" and I'm like, \"Yeah! Mum, believe me, I <em>need</em> them!\" Right down to my casual shoes. I'm a real running geek and I love a new pair of sneaks. Even a new training shoe, like the new Pegasus, it's fantastic. Shoes are definitely my go-to.</p><p><strong>Do you ever run to music? </strong>I do actually, yeah, I quite like running with my iPod in. Some days if you are having a bit of a down day it's just nice to get some music in and just get out there and run, and run free and just enjoy it.</p><p><strong>What's your post-race indulgence? </strong> Oooh, it depends on how well the race has gone, but I am a fan of going to the chip shop and having a battered sausage and chips, at the end of the season. Quite naughty!</p><p><strong>What's the worst thing about running? </strong>I think the worst thing is, the things that you can miss out on. Being an elite athlete is a choice that you make, you understand that because of the commitments you have to make you do have to miss out on family events, and friends' parties and holidays. But I see it as a choice that I've made to be a professional athlete, and I'm very lucky to have the people around me who are very supportive of that decision.</p><p><strong>And what's the best thing? </strong>I think the best thing is doing what I love as my job. I'm very lucky in the position that I'm in. When I first started running when I was 12, I said: \"I want to be a runner and go to the Olympic Games.\" And I have actually done that now! It's very strange that you can get up in the morning and go for a run and that's what you are getting paid to do. I think that if you are doing what you love, you are going to be successful.</p><p><strong>What's the furthest you've ever run? </strong> The furthest, it's probably a Sunday run. I think every runner does a long run on a Sunday. I think probably the longest was 13.5 miles. It was an accident, I should add!  It was supposed to be 12 – you might think 12 to 13.5 is not a big difference … but when you are tired, you've had a big week of training, that is a big detour on your run to get lost!</p><p><strong>What do you eat on the morning of a long run or hard session?</strong> Depending on the time of day I'm doing the run.. If it's in the afternoon I'd probably have your classic breakfast of porridge or cereal, then for lunch I'll have pasta and cheese. It varies, but I'm quite simple with my food, just cereal and toast or yoghurt, and pasta and cheese. Not too fussy, keep it simple, basic carbs. </p><p><strong>Have you ever run barefoot?</strong> No, I haven't. I hear a lot about barefoot technology and the thoughts behind that, but I've never actually done it myself. </p><p><strong>What's your greatest running achievement? </strong> It has to be making the Olympic final in my first major championships. Hopefully there's a lot more to come – and that's not what I'll be saying in five years' time!</p><p><strong>Mo Farah or Usain Bolt? </strong>Mo Farah. You've got to say that, I'm British, a distance runner … and it's exciting to watch!</p><p><strong>Who is the greatest ever runner?</strong> Oh, well, I'm going to be biased here and say Paula Radcliffe. She's my inspiration. One of my first sporting memories is of watching her break the world record here in London and that's stayed with me. She's someone I've learned from as the years have gone by – she' s a huge inspiration so definitely. She's my hero.</p><p><em>Laura Weightman wears the Nike Zoom Air Pegasus 31.

He contradicted a claim by al-Shabaab, an al-Qaida-linked group based in neighbouring Somalia, that it had carried out the deadly raids on Mpeketoni, Poromoko and other small settlements.</p><p>On Monday al-Shabaab <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/16/kenya-war-zone-alshabaab-islamist-militants-massacre\" title=\"\">warned foreign tourists that Kenya was now \"officially a war zone\"</a>. Yet in a televised address, Kenyatta blamed \"hatemongers\" and \"local political networks\" for the killings close to the tourist island of Lamu and denied that al-Shabaab was involved.</p><p>The president said: \"The attack in Lamu was well planned, orchestrated and politically motivated ethnic violence against a Kenyan community with the intention of profiling them and evicting them for political reasons.</p><p>\"This, therefore, was not an al-Shabaab attack. Evidence indicates that local political networks were involved in the planning and execution of a heinous crime. This also played into the opportunist network of other criminal gangs.\"</p><p></p><p>Kenyatta did not identify who was responsible or which community was being profiled. He said he had suspended some police officers on the ground, claiming they had not acted on intelligence they had obtained of the attack.</p><p>Al-Shabaab maintained its claim of responsibility after the speech. One of its officials told Agence France-Presse: \"It was our commandos who were taking care of things over the last two days in the Lamu area, and they will continue to do so.\"</p><p>Senator Moses Wetangula, an opposition politician, dismissed Kenyatta's claim as \"a joke\". He told the BBC: \"We Kenyans in the leadership, instead of calling in our friends who have better technology, better intelligence, better capacity to even use drones to hit these guys, we are saying it is not terrorism, it is political.\"</p><p>The second attack came when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/17/kenya-second-night-islamist-attacks-poromoko\" title=\"\">heavily armed, masked men reportedly went from door to door in the settlement of Poromoko in the early hours of Tuesday morning</a>, asking men to recite the Islamic creed, or <em>shahada</em>, and killing them if they could not. A least nine people are believed to have died.</p><p>Speaking from her hospital bed in Lamu where she was recovering from bullet wounds in her legs, Najma Wairimu, 36, said a group of hooded gunmen attacked her village of Mapenya, near Poromoko, at around 11pm.</p><p>\"They came in a group of almost 30 men and broke into our houses while shouting in Somali. My house was set on fire while we were still inside. We ran out and I was shot in the chaos. My aunt called and said her village was attacked and my uncle is dead,\" she added.</p><p>Kenya's interior ministry said it was trying to verify reports that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27882084\" title=\"\">12 women were abducted during the night's violence</a>, according to a BBC report. Kenya's interior ministry said it was trying to verify the reports.</p><p>The attack came 24 hours after an overnight siege in Mpeketoni, about 30 miles north-east of Poromoko. Gunmen prowled the town for up to eight hours, pulling people from their homes, hotels and venues screening World Cup football matches. Witnesses said a large number were tested in their knowledge of Islamic scripture and the Somali language, and killed if they failed. Almost all of the 49 dead were men.</p><p>Kenyatta's assertion is likely to cause puzzlement.

warns on poverty</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>BREAKING: The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for growth in the United States this year after a harsh winter weather hit the world’s largest economy in the early months of 2014.</b></p> <p>The downgrade comes in the IMF&apos;s latest update on the US economy, which also highlights stubbornly high poverty rates, high long-term unemployment and stagnant wages. </p> <p>It calls for the minimum wage to be raised to help alleviate poverty.</p> <h2>Here&apos;s my colleague Katie Allen&apos;s first take:</h2> <p>The IMF now believes GDP in the US will grow just 2% this year, only a fraction faster than 1.9% growth in 2013. It had previously forecast growth of 2.8% for this year back in April.<br /></p> <p>In addition to the blow to growth from the weather there was pressure from a “still-struggling housing market” and slower external demand, the IMF said.<br /></p> <p>Publishing the concluding statement of its latest mission to the US ahead of a press conference with director general Christine Lagarde, the IMF kept its growth forecast for 2015 at 3%.</p> <p>The statement says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Recent data ... suggest a meaningful rebound in activity is now underway and growth for the remainder of this year and 2015 should well exceed potential. This renewed dynamism, however, provides only a partial offset to the weak first quarter.”</p> </blockquote> <p>There is also continued concern about America’s trading position:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“As the economy strengthens, the current account deficit is expected to slowly widen with an increased demand for imports only partially offset by fiscal consolidation and the improvements in the trade balance that are linked to rising self-sufficiency in energy.”</p> </blockquote> <p>On the labour market, where unemployment is forecast to fall from 6.7% in 2013 to 6.2% this year and 5.9% in 2015, the statement says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Job growth has been healthy but labor markets are weaker than is implied by the headline unemployment number: long-term unemployment is high, labor force participation is well below what can be explained by demographic factors, and wages are stagnant. With better growth prospects, the U.S. should see steady progress in job creation. However, headline unemployment is expected to decline only slowly – in part because improving prospects will draw discouraged workers back into the labor force – and long-term unemployment will take time to fall to historic levels.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The IMF’s five themes for the US are: <b>raising productivity growth and labor participation, confronting poverty, keeping public debt on a sustained downward path, managing the exit from zero policy rates, and securing a safer financial system.</b></p> <p>On tackling poverty it says there needs to be a “much more robust return to growth and job creation” but also concrete policy measures such as an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, improvements in the Child Tax Credit and an increase in the minimum wage.</p> <p><br />There will be a long way to go, going by the IMF’s summing up the current situation:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“The latest data showed almost 50 million Americans living in poverty and the official poverty rate has been stuck above 15% despite the ongoing recovery.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Increasing the minimum wage would “help raise incomes for millions of working poor”, it added.<br /></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-539eebe2e4b0d256530d9d55\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-16T14:14:06.570+01:00\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>Greenpeace</b> has suffered a €3.8m loss after a currency hedge went badly wrong.</p> <p>The environmental charity agreed to buy foreign currencies at a set rate to protect itself from currency fluctuations, but ended up having its fingers burned.</p> <p>It has now <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Statement-on-foreign-currency-exchange-losses/\">apologised,</a> and the person responsible has been &apos;relieved of his position&apos;.</p> <p>Full story here:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/16/greenpeace-loses-3m-pounds-currency-speculation?CMP=twt_gu\">Greenpeace loses £3m in currency speculation</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GreenpeaceUK/statuses/478514118736244736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian\">@guardian</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianeco\">@guardianeco</a> We work in 40+ countries, but this should NOT have happened.&#10;See our full statement on here: <a href=\"http://t.co/JDawoGqXJg\">http://t.co/JDawoGqXJg</a></p>&mdash; Greenpeace UK (@GreenpeaceUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreenpeaceUK/statuses/478514118736244736\">June 16, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-06-16T14:18:01.654+01:00\">at 2.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-539ee25be4b03c5809cfd09c\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-06-16T14:04:32.400+01:00\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime catch-up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>The escalating insurgency in Iraq, and the cutting off of Ukraine&apos;s gas supply, have combined to send stock markets down across the board today</b>.</p> <p>European markets are all in the red, while the Dubai middle east market lost over 3% today after the Isis militant group made further gains - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/16/iraq-isis-takes-tal-afar-us-iran-vienna-nuclear-talks\">capturing the city of Tal Afar</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f2830a00-f7e9-45ac-84ac-c035bbbdb35b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/16/1402922949147/df1dcc93-2771-4417-87ca-7349c139adf9-460x164.png\" alt=\"European stock markets, 1.45pm.

That's the story of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a small country with big assets and bigger ambitions.</p><p>UAE should be a powerful defender of the status quo on energy use. Denying climate change would also make tremendous sense. But this country is attempting a pivot of historic proportions, trying to build a oil-free future in the desert. UAE has become a major player in clean technologies, funding large-scale renewable energy projects around the world, and investing millions in fundamental research (in partnership with MIT) in energy, water, microelectronics, advanced materials, and transportation systems.</p><p>Earlier this year, I spent a few days in Abu Dhabi (on a press trip with travel paid for by the PR firm that represents Masdar and the UAE), attending the city's annual World Future of Energy summit and spoke with key executives from the country's clean energy business arm. In recent weeks, I was struck by the difference between the UAE's approach and that of a similar sized entity, ExxonMobil. The oil company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/exxon-mobil-low-carbon-oil-markets\">released a long statement on the risk</a> of its oil and gas assets being \"stranded\" (that is, made worthless) by the world's potential pivot away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Exxon said there was no real risk to its investors – it would burn all the fuel it has in reserve, climate change be damned, because a) the world's poor and growing middle classes need energy and b) the world's governments would not take strong enough policy action to seriously reduce carbon emissions. On the latter point, sadly, the company may be right. On the first, though, it was top-notch propaganda to conflate the need for energy to a need for their form of carbon-based energy. We can provide carbon-free energy to the world, with or without Exxon.</p><p>In comparison to Exxon's backward-looking position, the UAE seems positively progressive on clean energy. At the Future of Energy Summit, UAE leaders announced a partnership with Denmark, and with Vestas Wind in particular, to tackle energy poverty in the developing world. The Wind for Prosperity project will offer carbon-free electricity to those who mostly use very expensive diesel generators for power. This partnership is only one example of the UAE's strategy to help bring about a clean economy future, which, according to Bader Al Lamki, the director of Masdar Clean Energy, has two major elements.</p><p>First, the country is helping build the global supply of clean energy, recognising that, as Al Lamki told me, \"conventional forms of energy are going to decline\" (a statement in direct opposition to Exxon's projections). Al Lamki runs a couple of funds investing hundreds of millions of dollars in some of the largest utility scale solar and wind projects in the world, as well as water desalination, energy storage, and energy efficiency.</p><p>Second, UAE built Masdar City, a demonstration project and research facility, to show how clean technologies could work in practice. Assessing the progress of Masdar City (which I visited), is a longer conversation. But the research going on there is real. UAE partnered with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to build a graduate degree programme and research facility to patent and leverage new technologies.</p><p>Cynics would say the UAE is doing this all for show, but it doesn't feel that way. And it's not new. Decades ago, the father of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (who died in 2004), laid out a surprising vision of critical issues that would shape the future of his country. The four main ideas, according to Fred Moavenzadeh, the MIT professor running the Masdar Institute of Technology, were the diversification from oil and gas, concern about climate change, the importance of good education for his people, and equal rights for women.</p><p>UAE is certainly not alone in trying to make a fundamental pivot away from fossil fuels. There's a surprisingly long list of countries that get over half their electricity from renewables already, although most are using hydropower to get there. A smaller group is going for the true renewables like solar, wind, and geothermal. </p><p>Germany, while struggling at times, is pursuing green energy aggressively. Kenya is planning to get <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/17/kenya-solar-power-plants\" title=\"\">half its electricity from solar</a> by 2016. Morocco is shooting for <a href=\"http://www.greenprophet.com/2012/10/morocco-renewable-energy/\" title=\"\">42% renewables by 2020</a>. Even Saudi Arabia has some aggressive solar goals and is investing over <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-31/saudi-arabia-to-target-solar-power-in-100-billion-energy-plan.html\" title=\"\">$100bn in a solar future</a>.</p><p>The business case for oil countries to go clean first is strong – every barrel they don't use they can sell at a vast profit to all of us. And it was actually a Saudi leader who once said memorably that the Stone Age did not end for lack of stones. But UAE seems to be taking that concept to heart. I heard the phrase, \"If you can do it here …\" repeatedly. They were talking about both the literal challenge of creating a net-zero building in a country with no water and 120F temperatures, and also about building a clean oasis in the middle of so much oil.</p><p>The scale of UAE's clean activity may not be enough to replace their oil-based economy any time soon. But it's clear that the country is trying to avoid a round trip from a nomadic existence to untold riches and back again. Companies and countries of all sizes should heed the heretical questions that this small, unusual country is posing, or risk a similar fate.</p><p><em>Andrew Winston, founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.andrewwinston.com\" title=\"\"><em>Winston Eco-Strategies</em></a><em>, is a globally recognised expert on green business strategy.</em></p><p><strong>Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

These are all key to enhancing e-learning and making sure that it does not lose the benefits of face-to-face learning. We must also ensure that we keep up to date with enhanced training tools when using e-learning and ensure that those we are trying to reach also have access to such technology.</p><h2><strong>Lorena Moreira, manager of social information systems, </strong><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.futuresgroup.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZGdG_6rabfcCtU2TIL643HUVtpA\" title=\"\"><strong>Futures Group</strong></a><strong>, Guatemala City, Guatemala </strong></h2><p><strong>Make access to technology a priority: </strong>What we see in Guatemala is that to turn the hype around e-learning into real education progress you need to improve access to IT infrastructure. And for that you need to find what technology is out there and build around it. Focus on the technology first and then the pedagogy.</p><p><strong>Use e-learning to teach more teachers: </strong>E-learning can bring down the costs of teacher training. Good education requires a significant investment in building the skills of teachers, so e-learning efforts need to begin with those delivering content. Traditional training for teachers costs a lot and often faces logistical issues. E-learning training costs a fraction of the cost and allows a much larger group of people to benefit from it.</p><h2><strong>Rosalind Gater, education advisor, </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Forganisations%2Fdepartment-for-international-development&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdMOf2jqWiPyBAbuG7oXFOyaW2Lw\" title=\"\"><strong>DfID</strong></a><strong>, London, UK. </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FDFID_edtech&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVmCJ6iTsH1QrZOdMkwgOEwSZnsw\" title=\"\"><strong>@DFID_edtech</strong></a><br /></h2><p><strong>Address the lack of research and evidence: </strong>Most of the evaluations we have studied do not present a breakdown of costs, provide value-for-money indicators, report key cost drivers or conduct a cost-benefit analysis.

This is predicted to rise, to about 930m by late 2019, when it is estimated that three in four mobile subscriptions will be internet inclusive. The growth is attributed to the rise of social media, content-rich apps and video content accessed from a new range of smartphones costing less than $50 (£30).</p><p>\"The rise of cheap smartphones will allow vast portions of the population – from middle classes in cities to small businesses in rural areas – access to mobile broadband,\" Jejdling added. \"Mobile commerce can offer endless opportunities for entrepreneurs and we've found that farmers are fans of mobile wallets – as well as teenagers wanting to watch music videos on their smartphone.\"</p><p>The mobile has had a unique impact on Africa because of its relative lack of physical connectivity and access to reliable electricity. The report says that 70% of users in the countries it researched browse the web on mobile devices, compared with just 6% who use desktop computers. \"Mobile users in the region have shown a preference for using their device for a variety of activities that are normally performed on laptops or desktops.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/05/economist-explains-18\" title=\"\">Mobile banking</a> has given consumers cheaper access to their finances, it says, reducing the need to travel to bank branches. \"The large number of people in sub-Saharan Africa who do not have bank accounts suggests that mobile phones may be the only way that many people will be able to access financial services.\"</p><p>The authors also cite the example of <a href=\"http://www.medafrica.org\" title=\"\">MedAfrica</a> as a mobile app providing basic information about health and medicine, reducing the need for travel and the pressure on doctors. \"Affordable access to mobile broadband is not a luxury, but a necessity in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa.\"</p><p>Entertainment content is also a factor, with some Nollywood movies spurring smartphone uptake in Nigeria.</p><p>The sub-Saharan African countries with the most mobile subscriptions are Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana.</p><p>Analysts said the findings confirmed the trend of mobile dominance in Africa. Toby Shapshak, publisher and editor of South Africa's Stuff magazine, who gave a recent <a href=\"http://on.ted.com/rkNC\" title=\"\">TED talk on technology in Africa</a>, said: \"Africa is a mobile-only continent. There never was a landline infrastructure to begin with, apart from urban areas. Mobile has allowed anyone to have a phone in places that were previously impassable and uncontactable. It has also been enabled, from a business perspective, by prepaid payments that handily remove the equally widespread legacy problem in that very few people have banks accounts. It really is that technology leapfrog the industry likes to talk about.\"</p><p>The mobile is having a profound social impact, Shapshak added, \"Better and faster internet access (which is still too high despite data cost reductions) mean people can consume the news via their mobiles – something that is especially important because so many African countries still control the major media outlets.\"</p><p>Arthur Goldstuck, head of <a href=\"http://www.worldwideworx.com\" title=\"\">World Wide Worx</a>, a technology research and strategy organisation in Johannesburg, said: \"Until a few years ago the quality of access was so poor that people had the devices but weren't really using it.

Throughout my career as a serial entrepreneur, I have always put the creative industries at the centre of all that I have done. My first business was as the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.triggerfishstudios.com/en/\" title=\"\">Triggerfish Animation</a>, one of Africa's leading animation companies. Triggerfish allowed me to understand the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/digital-content\" title=\"\">value of content</a>; it can educate, entertain and engage audiences. However, after 10 years in this role, it was clear that while Africa is a continent of storytelling and music and there is value in this content, traditional media only allowed for a few to have the privilege of this expression. To have a voice in the creative industry, an artist needs access to funds, broadcasters, radio, labels and more. Testament to this, <a href=\"http://issuu.com/icpubs/docs/ab0214_lr\" title=\"\">Africa's share of the global creative economy is less than 1%</a>, which proves that while talent is universal, opportunities are not; enter Bozza.</p><p><strong>What are Bozza's goals?</strong><br />Bozza is a technology platform that enables young African musicians, filmmakers and poets to connect with fans who want locally-relevant content via their mobile device, desktop and free-to-air satellite television. Trusted and transparent, Bozza is a marketplace for the next generation of African talent, unlocking the creative currency on the continent and catalysing positive social change at scale – turning access into economic participation for artists and pride for everyday African consumers.</p><p><strong>You focus on providing content local to the user, which most other online platforms don't provide. How successful has the strategy been so far?</strong><br />In terms of our success, after two years of development, Bozza has a robust platform that allows any artist anywhere in Africa to upload any digital material whether it is film, music, text or pictures. We then ensure that this content is optimised and served to fans on whatever device they are using. As a mobile first company, we ensure that artists' material can be consumed on more than 3,000 types of mobile devices, including feature phones. Audiences also have the option to use the desktop to discover new African artists.</p><p>Since August 2013, we have more than 1,100 artists from across Africa: Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal so far uploading their work and sharing with their fans. In launching a recent music service for South African users, we had  200,000 subscribers wanting locally relevant content. In short, our strategy has been a great success so far.</p><p><strong>Is media consumption and online culture in Africa the same as in the rest of the world – or are there distinct differences?</strong><br />The media consumption in Africa is primarily done through mobile devices, rather than a desktop or tablet. This is the main distinction which in turn impacts file size and time spent online due to the data costs.</p><p><strong>What's Bozza's future, and do you have any other projects in the pipeline?</strong><br />While Bozza continues to build the artist base from across Africa, we are also increasing the number of distribution channels to give the biggest possible reach for the artists. This includes not just mobile and desktop but also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPTV\" title=\"\">IPTV</a>, internet radio, satellite TV and events.</p><p><strong>Finally, what is your message for the delegates attending the Guardian's&nbsp;Activate Johannesburg Summit?</strong><br />Mobility has huge socio-economic, educational, commercial, societal and individual significance. Emerging economies have been hugely resourceful in using mobility in socio-economically important ways, to empower micro enterprises. By embracing mobility as a content delivery platform, emerging countries or continents can leapfrog developed economies, establishing a unique societal brand in a vibrant new industry.</p><p><em>Emma Kaye is a speaker at this year's </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/activate-johannesburg\" title=\"\"><em>Activate Johannesburg Summit, 26 June</em></a><em>.

In a recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/26/elearning-africa-education-conference\" title=\"\">interview on the network</a>, Rebecca Stromeyer, convenor of the conference, argued that this is one trend where we can confidently believe the hype. And she doesn't seem to be alone in her enthusiasm. A <a href=\"http://www.itwebafrica.com/ict-and-governance/271-zambia/232980-overwhelming-optimism-for-e-learning-in-africa#sthash.mCSAGQPl.dpuf\" title=\"\">recent report</a>, states that 74% of professionals in ICT and education are feeling optimistic about the future of e-learning in Africa.</p><p>Programmes such as the <a href=\"http://kepler.org/\" title=\"\">Kepler Project</a>, teaching vocational skills in Rwanda, and Africa's <a href=\"http://www.theafricareport.com/North-Africa/e-learning-in-africa-massive-online-and-free.html\" title=\"\">first MOOCs</a>, developed by the African Management Initiative (AMI), illustrate the potential to breakdown access barriers for groups logistically or financially locked out of education. E-learning is not just a means to an end either. The computer literacy skills gained in learning how to use technologies are valuable in their own right, particularly in a continent, such as Africa, with a growing ICT sector.</p><p>While e-learning may hold genuine promise for education, realising its potential isn't without its challenges. How do we ensure that investment in e-learning is not restricted to the technology itself, but extends to the infrastructure and resources needed to fully support it? How do we guarantee that e-learning benefits groups at all stages in education, including teachers? The focus on e-learning often centres around Africa, but where are the other examples of innovation?
