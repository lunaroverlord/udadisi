The assumption has always been that the majority of those who die from malaria are children. In fact, the deaths are much evenly spread than that - adults die too.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/03/malaria-deaths-research\">Sarah Boseley writes today</a> that </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It also raises urgent questions about the future of the troubled <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/\">Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria</a>, which has provided the money for most of the tools to combat the disease in Africa, such as insecticide-impregnated bed nets and new drugs. The fund is in financial crisis and has had to cancel its next grant-making round.</p></blockquote><p>There is some good news in the data. Since the peak of 2004 of 1.8 million deaths worldwide, the number has fallen annually and between 2007 and 2010, the decline in deaths has been more than 7% each year. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-385448454'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/10/18/1318955586565/malaria-vaccine-007.jpg' alt='malaria vaccine' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: PA</figcaption></figure><p>The researchers said the key to collecting the new data was the use of verbal autopsy data. </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>In a verbal autopsy, researchers interview the relatives of someone who has recently died to identify the cause of death. IHME and collaborators around the world published a series of articles in a special edition of Population Health Metrics in August 2011 focused on advancing the science of verbal autopsy. Verbal autopsy data were especially important in India, where malaria deaths have been vastly undercounted in both children and adults. IHME found that more than 37,000 people over the age of 15 in India died from malaria in 2010, and the chances of someone dying from malaria in India have fallen rapidly since 1980.</p></blockquote><p>We've extracted the data for deaths and death rates for all ages <a href=\"#data\">below</a>.

So why not chatshow host? That is the latest surprise incarnation announced by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/julian-assange\" title=\"\">Julian Assange</a>, who last week revealed his next step, after 13 months on bail fighting extradition to Sweden over sex assault accusations, would be to host a series of televised interviews with \"iconoclasts, visionaries and power insiders\" on the theme the world tomorrow\". The series, beginning in mid-March, will comprise 10 weekly, 30-minute episodes to be screened on Russia Today, the Kremlin-controlled propaganda channel of the Russian government.</p><p>Whether the series is being pre-recorded is unclear, but as Assange knows, his next step – including where he will find himself in the next couple of months – is even less certain. On Wednesday , 421 days after he was arrested in London concerning sex assault allegations made by two Swedish women, the Australian will reach the final stage in his battle to avoid extradition to Stockholm to fight potential charges, when his case comes before the supreme court. And so his lengthy, surreal period of house arrest in a Norfolk mansion while fighting off, he recently revealed, the attention of the \"hundreds\" of besotted women who have turned up at his door, is coming to an end.</p><p>In February last year, a court ruled that Assange should be sent to Sweden to answer the accusations; he appealed, and lost. But two high court judges granted him leave to appeal to the highest British court, not on the circumstances of his own case but on a point of law: namely, whether a prosecutor had sufficient authority to require someone's extradition, as in Assange's case. Many legal observers were surprised when the <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/news/379.html\" title=\"\">supreme court not only agreed</a> to hear Assange's petition, but said seven judges, rather than the usual five, would preside, \"given the great public importance of the issue raised\". The court will sit for two days, on 1 and 2 February, though the judges are unlikely to deliver their written verdict for a number of weeks.</p><p>Vaughan Smith, who has hosted Assange at his stately home, Ellingham Hall, for much of the past year on bail (Assange moved out shortly before Christmas), said the WikiLeaks founder views the supreme court decision as&nbsp;a \"vindication\" of his decision to fight extradition. \"He felt if he was facing seven judges, clearly he had brought up a matter of public importance and, as a consequence, might argue that what he was doing had an element of public service about it.\"</p><p>But Julian Knowles QC, a barrister specialising in extradition law based at Matrix Chambers, said the decision to might be more easily explained by the enormous public interest in Assange's case – \"to send the message that the highest court in the land has looked at this case, and it's had the attention of the best legal minds in the country\".</p><p><strong>Flexible</strong></p><p>In Knowles's view, the law in this area – <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/current-cases/CCCaseDetails/case_2011_0264.html\" title=\"\">whether a public prosecutor is a valid judicial authority</a> – has been comprehensively tested. \"This point has been litigated before, and the courts have always reached the clear answer that while it may look odd to English eyes, common law eyes ... European systems don't have the same structure. The courts have always said that to make extradition work, you have to be flexible in your approach to what extradition is.\" The consequences if Assange were to win, he said, would be \"very profound\". \"It would basically mean, until the law is rewritten, that extradition to Europe [would] become very difficult, if not impossible. Because in the vast majority of European extradition requests, the arrest warrant is issued not by a court, as it would be in England, but by a prosecutor.\"</p><p>It is much easier to predict what will happen if Assange loses. Though he would still have the option to make an application to the European court of human rights (as he has hinted he may do at earlier stages of the process), this would not delay his extradition, since Sweden is also a signatory to that convention. Instead, the extradition unit at Scotland Yard would agree with their Swedish counterparts a date, within 10 days, for Assange to be handed over, according to Knowles. The Australian would be required to present himself at one of the main London airports, where he would be handed to Swedish police, who would escort him on a flight to Stockholm. Once on Swedish soil, he would immediately be arrested.</p><p>In preparation for such an eventuality, Assange some months ago contracted new Swedish lawyers and a PR consultant, <a href=\"http://www.ullmanpr.se/\" title=\"\">Harald Ullman</a>, charged with restoring his reputation, which some claim has been \"smeared\" by supporters of the two alleged victims (the women's supporters, however, argue that it is they who have been unjustly characterised).</p><p>According to Per E Samuelson, one of Assange's new lawyers: \"Bail does not exist in Sweden. We will of course try to get him released while awaiting the court case to take place. But ... normally it is not unusual that people are kept in custody in sex abuse cases before the court case has taken place. It is possible, he said, that Assange could be barred from communicating with anyone other than his lawyers in that period. \"That is a matter for the Swedish court.\"</p><p>Dependent on whether sufficient evidence were found to bring an indictment, Samuelson said, that stage of the process might take three months. If an indictment were brought, the likelihood is that a trial would follow only a few weeks later.</p><p>Swedish rape and sexual assault cases are heard substantially in private, ostensibly to protect both the name of the alleged victim and the accused. That would apply in this case, even though Assange's name was leaked by police to Swedish media soon after accusations were made, while the women's identities have been widely circulated online by his supporters.</p><p>The trial, likely to take five to seven days, according to Samuelson, would be heard in a district court, which would deliver its verdict two to three weeks later. Both parties would have the opportunity to appeal.</p><p>Samuelson is clear in his position: \"I know the case very well, and I would say that the accusations against him are a joke. He is quite innocent in my deepest belief.\" He also argues that \"it is a bad climate to be accused of sex allegations in Sweden, because of the political pressure to convict, even if the evidence is weak. There is a political opinion that you should rely on the women.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://advokathessius.se/\" title=\"\">Ingela Hessius</a>, a Stockholm barrister who worked for 19 years as a prosecutor specialising in sexual violence cases, declined to discuss the particulars of the Assange case, but said she \"strongly rejected\" the characterisation of the Swedish legal system as a climate that favours women. \"It has increased, the number of reports from people being raped, but the number of convictions is not very high, and the number of indictments is also not very high,\" she said. \"There is something in the nature of the crime itself that makes [prosecution] very difficult, because you need something more than just the victim's story, otherwise you have version against version. That's not enough for a conviction, it's not enough for an indictment either. You need something more.\"</p><p>If anything, she says, \"I think the courts are sometimes a bit afraid to convict in a sexual crimes case. So no, it is not a paradise for feminists at all.\"</p><p>Whether or not the supreme court rules Assange should face a Swedish investigation, this is far from the only legal process the WikiLeaks founder fears. The US government is prosecuting an army private, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bradley-manning\" title=\"\">Bradley Manning</a>, alleging he is the source of many of WikiLeaks's high-profile releases; it has also opened a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/may/11/us-opens-wikileaks-grand-jury-hearing\" title=\"\">grand jury investigation</a> with the purpose of deciding whether to prosecute WikiLeaks or its founder. That process is carried out in secret, without any rights of access for Assange or his lawyers. Many of the Australian's supporters fear the US will seek his extradition – from the UK, Sweden or elsewhere – with a view to prosecuting him for \"conspiracy to commit espionage\", based on a notional allegation that he may have \"coached\" Manning to leak documents to the site.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.com/\" title=\"\">David Coombs</a>, Manning's lawyer, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/16/manning-demands-judge-step-down\" title=\"\">said at a preliminary court martial hearing in December</a> that he believed the US military was attempting to strongarm the young soldier into taking a plea bargain and incriminating Assange, suggesting the WikiLeaks founder was regarded by the US as the bigger prize. Assange and WikiLeaks were represented at the hearing by Amy Jacobsen, a lawyer for the <a href=\"center for constitutional rights\" title=\"\">Centre for Constitutional Rights</a>, a New York-based legal organisation focusing on civil rights, which has recently worked in support of Guantánamo detainees. She was denied access, despite the centre's <a href=\"http://www.ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-appeals-denial-of-guaranteed-access-manning-hearing-wikileaks-attorneys\" title=\"\">argument that</a> \"the proceedings are clearly closely linked to a grand jury in Virginia reported to be issuing subpoenas for information on our clients\".</p><p><strong>Conspiracy</strong></p><p>Michael Ratner, president emeritus of the CCR, told the Guardian he believed the grand jury was being used as a \"fishing expedition\" in the Assange case. The US department of justice never comments on grand jury investigations – indeed, their existence is known only if witnesses who have been subpoenaed to give evidence choose to speak of their experiences, as they are permitted to do. Does Ratner believe the US government is likely to seek Assange's extradition on potential conspiracy charges? \"My hope is there is still a fight within the government, which says: 'How do you go after Julian Assange and WikiLeaks without going after the New York Times?' And I would hope that the voices of reason win out, but we have a lot of 'dark side' in our country. Certainly if you look at ... what they have done to Bradley Manning, it looks to me like they are by hook or crook trying to go after WikiLeaks and Julian Assange.\"</p><p>Though Assange and his supporters say extradition to Sweden would make such a process easier, Knowles disagrees. If Assange were to be sent to Sweden, he said, \"the US can ask for his extradition, but they then have to do two things: they have to gain his extradition under Swedish law, and Sweden would also have to get the permission of the UK to send him onwards [since] if the UK sends anybody abroad, they can't be sent then to a further country without the UK's permission. So it makes it harder for the US, having waited all this time.\" In addition, he said: \"If the US were to make an extradition request based upon his activities as a journalist, then it becomes immensely difficult legally,\" arguing the potential clash between allegations of espionage under US law, Assange's freedom of expression rights under Article 10 of the European convention, and the US first amendment rights guaranteeing freedom of speech, would present \"a very complicated legal situation, the answer to which I wouldn't like to predict\".</p><p>Any attempted prosecution for journalistic activities would almost certainly rouse a spirited international media campaign in defence of Assange. <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/cutline/times-guardian-editors-stand-shoulder-shoulder-assange-prosecuted-20110204-051134-009.html\" title=\"\">Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian's editor-in-chief</a>, has said: \"If, God forbid, this came to court, I would be completely side-by-side with him in terms of defending him with respect to what he did.\" Bill Keller, then editor of the New York Times, concurred.</p><p>As for Assange's Australian citizenship, it is unclear whether, or how forcefully, his government might seek to resist any possible US extradition attempt. Though three former prime ministers — <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/fraser-urges-protection-of-assange-20111218-1p0v4.html\" title=\"\">Malcolm Fraser</a>, <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/kevin-rudd-john-howard-speak-out-over-wikileaks-julian-assange/story-e6frf7lf-1225967838974\" title=\"\">Kevin Rudd and John Howard</a> — have at different times spoken in support of Assange, Robert McClelland, Australia's then attorney general, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/government-unlikely-to-aid-assange-20111217-1oztc.html\" title=\"\">indicated in December</a> that the government would be unlikely to intervene in any potential US extradition request to Sweden.</p><p>For all the speculation over potential legal processes, there is, of course, a potential version of events in which the supreme court rules in Assange's favour, the US is unable or chooses not to indict him, and he finds himself, for the first time in more than a year, a free man. What might he choose to do then?</p><p>WikiLeaks has, it admits, <a href=\"http://www.wikileaks.org/\" title=\"\">suspended its activities</a> at least for the time being, thanks to a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/24/wikileaks-blockade-julian-assange\" title=\"\">financial blockade </a>of donations, which Assange has argued has cost the site up to €50m (£42m). But while the choice of some of his new allies has attracted fierce criticism – his decision to broadcast on Russia Today, which silences any criticism of the Putin regime, has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/lebedevalex/status/162146442692149249\" title=\"\">condemned</a> – he is not without powerful and wealthy friends around the world.</p><p>The Australian's UK visa expired during his time in custody — he has, in any case, surrendered his passport to police. But it is likely that he might, as a free man, seek to take his activities elsewhere. Asked in <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/julian-assange-the-rolling-stone-interview-20120118\" title=\"\">a recent Rolling Stone interview</a> what he hoped to do next, Assange said: \"I don't want to end up anywhere. I want to do what I was doing before. I lived in Egypt when we had important things that needed to be done, or in Kenya or the US or Australia or Sweden or Germany. When we have opportunities, that's where I am.\"</p><p>• This article was amended to reinforce Robert McClelland's status as attorney general at the time he commented on the Assange extradition issue in December 2011.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/30/1327944448551/Julian-Assange-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/30/julian-assange-extradition-wikileaks","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/2012/jan/30/julian-assange-extradition-wikileaks","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"African Twitter map reveals how continent stays connected","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-26T15:02:41Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2012/jan/26/african-twitter-map-continent-connected","fields":{"body":"<p>The first Twitter map of Africa shows the social network is forging links between smartphone users from Cape Town to Cairo while, with a few exceptions,  political and business leaders are yet to get the hang of tweeting.</p><p>More than 11.5m geographically pinpointed tweets originating on the continent during the last three months of 2011 were analysed by Portland Communications's Kenya office and media platform <a href=\"http://tweetminster.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tweetminster</a>.</p><p>Africa's biggest economy, South Africa, generated the most tweets with over 5m, more than double second placed Kenya's 2.48m.

His reports, especially from Greece, have blended concise global analysis with sympathetic news from the frontline, revealing angry and scared people staring into a bleak future amid the wreckage of shattered certainties.</p><p>So his analysis of global unrest was one I looked forward to immensely, especially having myself spent chunks of last year watching revolutions unfold in Africa and the Middle East and protests grow in Europe. What was it that suddenly propelled a generation on to the streets in search of social justice? And how real are the claimed connections between technology and protest, between the revolutionaries in Tahrir Square and their pale imitations in tents by St Paul's Cathedral?</p><p>Sadly, there are few answers to be found in this book, which has Mason flitting from Athens to Arizona to Cairo searching for answers to why it's \"kicking off everywhere\". For all his undoubted reporting skills and passion for the cause, this collection of essays is little more than a jumble of often questionable generalisations, tendentious assertions and impressionistic sketches. Ultimately, Mason is let down by his desire to force the messy mosaic of last year's amazing events into the straitjacket of his own ideological leanings.</p><p>So when Lehman Brothers crashed, it became possible to imagine \"the collapse of capitalism\"; last year was all about \"a revolt against Hayek and the principles of selfishness and greed he espoused\". Mason claims the present system offers the poorest a route out of poverty but only by impoverishing the workforces of the west, ignoring the fact that recent decades have seen global rises in living standards, health and lifestyles unmatched in history.</p><p>Huge urban slums, meanwhile, are supposedly \"the hidden consequence of 20 years of untrammelled market forces, greed, neglect and graft\", not the highly complex communities they have always been, offering rural migrants an often brutal entry point to a more prosperous life. And his claim that the deprived half of humanity, those struggling to live on $2 a day, are impervious to the internet age ignores the transformative power of mobile communications he himself witnessed in Kenya.</p><p>From the opening pages, the evils of capitalism and neoliberalism are presented as one of they key causes of the Arab spring. This ignores another uncomfortable truth for Mason: the spark was lit by the self-immolation of a fruit vendor who was a repressed entrepreneur, and <em>this</em> is why it reverberated so strongly around the region, where so many people's attempts to earn a living were hampered by corrupt officials and governing kleptocracies.</p><p>Even in Egypt, which Mason uses as a key example, these are false targets. One analyst told me last month his biggest worry was that market-based reforms just starting to deliver results before the revolution would be choked off now, because of their association with Gamal Mubarak and the corporatist stranglehold of a military dictatorship that still controls perhaps one quarter of the economy.</p><p>The seed of this book was planted with an impassioned blog that went viral, which Mason wrote following a discussion about the Paris Commune with 60 students in a Bloomsbury squat. This sets the tone for the whole&nbsp;book, sprinkled as it is with references to Chomsky and Debord. Mason claims the subsequent Millbank&nbsp;student protests were \"one of those unforeseeable events that catalyse everything\", while on the \"flame-lit\" face of protesters \"you saw&nbsp;the look of people who had discovered the power of mayhem\". There is lots of this sort of stuff.</p><p>And rather annoyingly, many of the students – and others – are repeatedly referred to by their Twitter tags. It is all a bit Dad dancing at the disco, an impression reinforced by bumbling forays into pop culture, such as calling hip-hop artists \"black dudes with diamond earrings\" and muddling up dubstep and \"the grime\".</p><p>As one would expect from a journalist with Mason's pedigree, there are some sharp ideas lurking among all this. His take on technology is often acute, examining the impact of networked individuals, the power of collaboration and the challenge horizontal social networks pose to repressive states, corporations and hermetically sealed ideologies. And he is right to identify the rise of the graduate without a future as a potent force in many parts of the world along&nbsp;with the impact of rising food prices. But unfortunately, this book does little justice to either the magnitude of its subject or the reputation of its author.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/1/6/1325873798679/paul-mason-kicking-off-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/15/kicking-off-paul-mason-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2012/jan/15/kicking-off-paul-mason-review","sectionName":"Books"},{"webTitle":"Google 'improperly' accessed Kenyan rival Mocality's database","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-13T19:21:15Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2012/jan/13/google-kenyan-rival-mocality-database","fields":{"body":"<p>Google has confessed that a number of people working for it \"improperly\" accessed the customer database of a rival company in Kenya to boost its own business.</p><p></p><p>The US search giant said it was \"mortified\" to learn that staff illicitly entered the business directory of a Kenyan listings firm, called <a href=\"http://blog.mocality.co.ke\" title=\"\">Mocality</a>, in an attempt to sell a competing product to the rival's customers.</p><p></p><p>The allegations were first made public in <a href=\"http://blog.mocality.co.ke/2012/01/13/google-what-were-you-thinking/\" title=\"\">a blogpost</a> on Friday by the chief executive of Mocality, Stefan Magdalinski, who accused Google of \"telling untruths\" and a \"human-powered, systematic, months-long, fraudulent ... attempt to undermine our business\".</p><p></p><p>Magdalinski claimed to have unearthed the alleged malpractice almost immediately after Google launched a rival initiative in the country, dubbed \"<a href=\"http://www.kbo.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Getting Kenyan Businesses Online</a>\".</p><p></p><p>Google said it immediately began investigating the accusations, which it described as \"very serious\".

Looking at the track records of people you would hope would have known better, they may wish they hadn't made them either. Bill Gates predicted the end of spam by January 2006, and Alan Sugar declared the iPod dead by Christmas of the same year. When I'm asked to make predictions, I either shy away or say what I hope will happen, rather than what I think will happen.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the <a href=\"http://afrinnovator.com/blog/2011/12/28/africa-tech-in-2012-12-predictions/\" title=\"\">quality of the prediction</a>, a quick glance through history demonstrates one recurring theme: things take longer to materialise than most people think.</p><p>By the end of 2011, mobile banking was supposed to be \"everywhere\" in Africa, tablets would signal the end of netbooks, most Africans would have a $50 smartphone, downloadable apps would kill the mobile internet and m-health (mobile health) would finally fulfil its promise. Of course, you could argue that many of these things could still happen, and some are a lot closer than you think. At $80, the <a href=\"http://whiteafrican.com/2010/09/06/100-ideos-android-phone-launches-in-kenya/\" title=\"\">Ideos smartphone</a>, launched in Kenya in 2010, is the cheapest smartphone yet. Promising, yes, but these devices need to cost well under half of that if they're to become ubiquitous across the continent.</p><p></p><p>So, here are my hopes (not predictions)  for the information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) community over the next 12 months.</p><p></p><h2>1  Executing best practice<br /></h2><p>Technology races ahead at a breathtaking pace, but behaviour change chugs along in a much lower gear. As I remind people when I speak at conferences, technology is the easy bit – people (and their habits and expectations) are far more difficult to manage.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to another bumper year, the ICT4D community has even more toys to play with than it did 12 months ago. However, so much of what it debates – and practices – remains the same year after year. \"Understand the problem before tackling the technology, put the user first, build tools and not solutions, learn from your failures, don't reinvent the wheel, use appropriate technologies\" and so on. How many more conferences do we need before we finally settle on a set of best practices? We should know by now what is and what isn't a good way to run an ICT4D project. Let's instead match best practice against projects, and let's ensure they become an intrinsic part of the development process rather than simple soundbites and tweets.</p><p></p><h2>2  Keeping the tech real<br /></h2><p>New technologies lead to hype, which in turn leads to new conversations and new big ideas as if earlier problems had been solved. It's unfortunate that attention spans seem to decrease as rates of innovation increase, and it's easy to be distracted from the technological reality for much of the planet in the age of the ultra-smartphone and iPad. Trumpeting the need for <a href=\"http://www.kiwanja.net/blog/2010/04/rethinking-schumacher/\" title=\"\">\"appropriate technologies\" </a>at a development conference is only helpful if people don't then run off and build iPad 2.0 apps for African farmers. The reality is that we're still figuring out how to <a href=\"http://www.kiwanja.net/blog/2011/06/mobile-technology-and-the-last-mile/\" title=\"\">best use text messaging</a> in a development capacity, and that particular technology has been around for years.</p><p></p><p>That's my second hope for 2012 – that the ICT4D community keep its technology choices firmly routed in what's appropriate for their users, not what's newly available in their local store.</p><p></p><h2>3  Mainstreaming ICT4D<br /></h2><p>Finally, I'd love to see ICT4D and m4d (mobiles for development) go mainstream. Today, we have a crazy situation where each sector of development seems to be divided into two camps – the people who are deploying (or most likely figuring out how to deploy) mobile technologies, and those who aren't. The former put an \"m\" in front of their discipline, giving us m-heath, m-agriculture, m-learning, and so on. The rest remain plain old health, agriculture and learning. Even worse, they often go to different conferences.</p><p></p><p>So my final hope for 2012 is that technology becomes so intrinsic to the development process that we no longer feel the need to separate it out. We never had p-health (paper health), or b-learning (blackboard learning). ICT4D will only have truly succeeded when it becomes invisible, intrinsic and yes, ultimately works its way out of a job.</p><p></p><p>Here's to an interesting 12 months.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2010/10/6/1286378985913/MDG-Broadband-in-Africa---002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jan/04/technology-make-difference-2012","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jan/04/technology-make-difference-2012","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Problems pile up in Kenya's election year","webPublicationDate":"2012-01-02T10:51:52Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2012/jan/02/problems-kenya-election-year","fields":{"body":"<p>\"<em>Karibu Kenya</em>, <em>hakuna matata</em>,\" – Welcome to Kenya, there are no problems.</p><p>So goes the traditional greeting for visitors to east Africa's top tourist destination.</p><p>But Kenyan wags have come up with a new version: \"<em>Karibu Kenya, hakuna matata, hakuna maji, hakuna stima, hakuna gas\"</em> – Welcome to Kenya, no problems, no water, no electricity, no gas.</p><p>This sarcastic take on the well-known slogan reveals the frustration felt by many in a country that is flexing its military muscles on the regional stage, but failing to deliver on promises at home ahead of critical elections in 2012.</p><p>Kenyans will go to the polls, most likely in December, to choose a new president and parliament. The last election in 2007 brought the country to the brink of civil war amid accusations of fraud. Around 1,300 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.</p><p>Few analysts are willing to take a punt on whether the 2012 polls will be disrupted by the same toxic mix of ethnicity, politics and greed. Kenya is still struggling with these old demons, but also facing new pressures.</p><p>Recent military incursion into Somalia has compounded a sense of uncertainty and insecurity.</p><p>Heavy rains have displaced thousands, ruined crops, caused power blackouts and turned Nairobi into a gridlocked quagmire. There was a shortage of water in some places and for weeks, in an unrelated scarcity, cooking gas was unavailable.</p><p>The rains and floods, coming as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2011/aug/17/kenya-drought-famine-malnourishment-video\" title=\"\">drought continued to bite</a> in the north, laid bare the weaknesses of east Africa's biggest economy, which has long been at the mercy of endemic corruption and government lassitude.</p><p>\"The economy has been blinking amber all year,\" said <a href=\"http://www.rich.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Aly-Khan Satchu</a>, an independent Nairobi-based analyst. \"The current account deficit has crossed 10%, putting us on a par with Greece and Swaziland.\"</p><p>The <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/KENYAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:22600594~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:356509,00.html\" title=\"\">World Bank</a> has revised down growth estimates, and the Kenyan shilling sank to a record low against the dollar in October, pushing food and fuel prices higher. The central bank hiked rates repeatedly as inflation climbed to nearly 20% in November. The currency has strengthened since, but for many the damage has already been done.</p><p>Satchu says there are two economies in Kenya – the old one that exists to serves the interests of a ruling elite, and a new economy based on IT and mobile technology. Overall, Kenya has shown resilience, bouncing back from the post-election crisis thanks mainly to tourism, a thriving ICT sector and the mobile money revolution.</p><p>Nairobi embodies this dual-track reality. The city where 60% of the population live in slums is also a regional hub for IT development and entrepreneurship.</p><p>Politically too, the picture is not uniformly bleak. Last year, a new <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/05/kenya-votes-for-new-constitution\" title=\"\">constitution was ratified</a> in a peaceful vote seen as an important first step towards eradicating the dangers of poll-related violence.

In that request, I suggested that if they weren't sure what might interest us, they may wish to respond to any or all of the following questions;</p><p>-- everyone is passionate about their camera: what specific camera<br />equipment do you use, and why?<br />-- what is your favourite piece of camera equipment?<br />-- what got you interested in photographing birds?<br />-- where are your favourite places to go birding (and bird photographing), and why?<br />-- which of your bird images are your favourites -- why do you like those images so much?<br />-- what is your favourite bird species -- why?</p><p>Several of our Mystery Bird photographers responded so, as promised, I am sharing their responses with you. </p><p> </p><p>The third Mystery Bird photographer I am introducing is Dan Logen. He is passionate about travel and about nature -- especially birds. Although I've never met him in real life, we've corresponded for years and Mr Logen is one of my many Seattle bird pals. I've admired his photography for so long that I cannot remember with certainty how I first came to share his images as mystery birds, although I think it was after he shared some of his African bird photographs with the local birding email list, Tweeters, that we are both members of. </p><p>I think Mr Logen's photography is a pleasing blend of artistic style with a birder's discerning eye. His images of people are especially captivating; capturing a glimpse of the ongoing story as well as his overall kindness towards his subjects.</p><p>Mr Logen also has a suite of wonderful lenses that I aspire to get and learn to use one day with my own Nikon camera, including the newest addition to his kit, a fish-eye lens! </p><p>Mr Logen's response is copied below, with only a few words changed. All of the photographs that he sent are presented here, along with his comments about them. I have added scientific names in parentheses. </p><p><em>Mr Logen writes:</em> </p><p>My interest in photography started as a teen.  A cousin managed to get an Asahi Pentax for me at a very reasonable price back in the 60's, and that with two or three accessory lenses was my gear for some 10 years.  In the early 70's I was able to purchase a Nikkormat and Nikon F which are still very functional some 40 years later.  Along with these great bodies, I got a 500 mm f/8 Reflex lens which I thought was pretty good at the time; and it was, for the money. Now I have thousands of slides filed away, few of them good quality by today's standards. </p><p>With the arrival of digital photography I have increased dramatically the amount of photography I do. My current gear is primarily the Nikon D300 and D300s. Together, these two bodies have almost 100,000 shutter actuations. My lens for birds is typically the Nikon 600 VR lens, sometimes with a 1.4 extender. For mammals in Africa, the 200-400 VR lens works well. I have had fun with a fisheye lens recently.</p><p>My focus in photography has always been nature, with birds and mammals my favorites, but also wildflowers, macro work, and some landscapes. I even take a few photos of people! In the last couple years with improving technology, it has been fun to work with HDR and photomerge.</p><p>In the last 15 years I have been lucky to be able to travel to all 7 continents.  In 2000, I joined a safari to East Africa led by my cousin Walt. I was hooked by the colorful birds, abundant mammals, and the culture. By now I have completed 5 trips to East Africa. Many of my African images, as well as a variety of others can be seen on my <a href=\"www.picasaweb.google.com/logenp\">Picasa site</a>.  </p><p>I enjoy getting good clean portraits, but like anybody, action photos are also attractive. Here are a few of my favorites.</p><p>This image (above) from the window of my room at Debre Libanos in Ethiopia utilizes both a fish-eye lens and HDR. The window is actually square. Five exposures were combined with Photomatix, for the HDR effect [<a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7019/6606815319_267c41d208_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\">embiggen</a>].</p><p>Our capitol building in Washington DC (above). This exposure was obtained after dark, with a tripod mounted camera and 5 different exposures.  The city lights provided illumination for the clouds, and the shorter exposures were correct for the illuminated building [<a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7001/6606839017_e6b71b063c_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\">embiggen</a>].</p><p>This is my favorite HDR image -- hand held even -- from inside the capitol building in Helena, Montana (above).

[<a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6606862153_7cb67cb471_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\">embiggen</a>].</p><p>This woman on the street in Lalibela, Ethiopia, is quite amused at something. Unfortunately I forget what she was looking at!

The water plants add interest [<a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7160/6606915963_ba02b7e685_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"652\">embiggen</a>].</p><p>This boatman with the big smile is a tight portrait, captured with a 600 mm lens [<a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7012/6606931761_ef23a84074_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\">embiggen</a>].</p><p>Little bee-eater (<em>Merops pusillus</em>; above) with bee. The 600 mm lens provides a pleasing background, and of course the bee adds interest. Image was captured in the sweet light of late afternoon [<a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7159/6606952481_95d2c657de_b.jpg\" width=\"687\" height=\"1024\">velociraptorise</a>].</p><p>This Bateleur (<em>Terathopius ecaudatus</em>; above) appears quite angry. He would be a good mascot for the currently popular video game \"Angry Birds.\" The background is non-distracting, the eye contact is good [<a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7017/6606968425_4df8017bed_b.jpg\" width=\"693\" height=\"1024\">velociraptorise</a>].</p><p>Malachite kingfisher (<em>Alcedo cristata</em>; above).

The head angle is perfect, and the late afternoon lighting is great. One of my favorite bird portraits [<a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7149/6607000109_a0ec0c4f75_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"711\">velociraptorise</a>]. </p><p>This white-throated bee-eater (<em>Merops albicollis</em>; above) in Kenya was photographed in late afternoon light. He -- or she -- was interacting with its mate on a nearby perch. The wing flap seemed to be a courtship display. This was the best of several images captured at five per second [<a href=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7171/6607015823_603af94d0b_b.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\">velociraptorise</a>].</p><p>A waterbuck (<em>Kobus ellipsiprymnus</em>; above) at Ngorongoro Conservation Area. It was too close to the road for the 600 mm lens I had out, so this is actually a vertical photomerge of two images. I cropped a little off the top, and added a little canvas on both sides.

It is a sandy patch of land surrounded by water in which bare-chested boys in dugout canoes paddle among the hyacinths. A giant pump is working day and night, reclaiming land from the sandbanks and river beds, expanding the city in defiance of nature.</p><p>Welcome to <a href=\"http://www.lacitedufleuve.com\" title=\"\">La Cité du Fleuve</a> – River City, or \"the new Manhattan\" as this multibillion-pound development has been hopefully described by newspapers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Just 15 hectares (38 acres) now, but aiming for 380, it is perhaps the most ambitious statement yet about Africa's improving fortunes – and the promise of a growing African consumer class.</p><p>River City is backed by a British hedge fund that specialises in counter-trend betting and, says the developer Robert Choudury, \"a bigger counter-trend is hard to find\". Ravaged by war and disease, DRC ranks bottom of the UN's human development index. More than half the population is living on less than $1.25 a day and only 2% of roads are paved.</p><p>But change is happening all over Africa and it looks possible, even here. Sitting with an iPad on his desk in the only building completed so far, French-born Choudury likens the project to Sandton, the commercial heart of Johannesburg often described as the wealthiest square mile on the continent.</p><p>His plans include a 18,000-square metre shopping mall and 100-room hotel built by South African entrepreneur Richard Moloko, plus churches, condominiums, hospitals and restaurants, \"everything you need\" away from the mayhem of Kinshasa's overcrowded, overpriced real estate today.</p><p>It is hoped that hydro-power from the nearby Congo River will provide more than a third of the new district's energy needs. All this could take decades, but Choudury has already sold four apartments – to Congolese buyers – for $218-250,000 each.</p><p>When Choudury, 52, was first trying to drum up interest in the development, he took out an eight-page newspaper advert with the words, \"The future is Africa\". The claim seems more and more credible.</p><p>Africa's middle class is a reality and widening by the day. It is <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/12/juma.htm\" title=\"IMF: Africa's new engine\">a trend marked by changing lifestyles, greater spending power</a>, more recreational time, the harnessing of technology and a new political assertiveness and cultural self-confidence.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Publications/The%20Middle%20of%20the%20Pyramid_The%20Middle%20of%20the%20Pyramid.pdf\" title=\"African Development Bank report\">African Development Bank (AfDB) says Africa's middle class had risen to 313 million people</a> in 2010, 34% of the continent's population – compared with 111 million (26%) in 1980, 151 million (27%) in 1990 and 196 million (27%) in 2000.</p><p>The bank's report defined middle class as people who spend the equivalent of $2-$20 (£1.30-£13) a day, saying this is appropriate given the cost of living for Africa's near 1 billion people. It acknowledged that many living on $2-$4 a day are \"floating\" and could easily slip back into poverty. Taking these people out of the equation, it put the stable middle class at 123 million, 13% of the population. But AfDB is bullish about the future, predicting the African middle class will grow to 1.1 billion (42%) in 2060. By then, those living below the poverty line will be in the minority (33%). Mthuli Ncube, the bank's chief economist, describes the trajectory as \"unstoppable\".</p><p>Others, such as the OECD and World Bank are less confident, yet a body of research is starting to build an alternative narrative about Africa. The Economist magazine, which in 2000 ran a cover story headlined \"<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/333429\" title=\"Economist: The Hopeless Continent\">The hopeless continent</a>\", has just performed a U-turn with \"<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21541015\" title=\"Economist: The Hopeless Continent\">The hopeful continent</a>\".</p><p>While the headlines in 2011 were grabbed by revolution in north Africa and famine in Somalia, the underlying mantra of the past decade has been growth, growth, growth.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Africa to have grown by 6% this year and grow by nearly 6% in 2012, roughly the same as Asia and in stark contrast to the eurozone. Over the past decade, six of the world's 10 fastest-growing countries were African. And in eight of the past 10 years, the African lions have grown faster than the Asian tigers.</p><p>One of the most striking examples is Nigeria, where GDP rose five-fold from $46bn (£29bn) in 2000 to $24bn (£158bn) in 2011, according to the IMF. <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201110060452.html\" title=\"\">A survey by Renaissance Capital</a> found that nearly half of the country's middle class (defined as an average monthly income of $500-$600) were planning to buy fridges, freezers and other white goods, \"suggesting a consumer boom is under way\".</p><p>Africa has a young, fast-growing, fast-urbanising population. Many countries have benefited from a commodities boom and a 10-fold rise in foreign investment in the past decade, notably from China. Africa's productivity is growing by nearly 3% a year, compared with 2.3% in the United States. Arguably, governance is improving, elections spreading and dictatorships and wars declining.</p><p>Perhaps the most tangible catalyst is technology. The mobile phone is fast becoming as much an African symbol as the leopard or baobab tree.</p><p>A Gallup poll this year found they are owned by 71% of adults in Nigeria, 62% in Botswana and more than half the populations of Ghana and Kenya. The continent is the world's fastest-growing mobile phone market, according to the industry group Groupe Spéciale Mobile Association – Africa's 600m users make it second only to Asia. Subscriber levels have grown by almost 20% for each of the past five years, and the total is expected to hit 735 million by 2013.</p><p>Around a 10th of Africa's land mass is covered by mobile-internet services – a higher proportion than in India. This has allowed Africans to leapfrog poor landline infrastructure, which had been a brake on progress. Many will get their first internet experience on a mobile rather than a desktop computer, using services that are revolutionising commerce, farming and healthcare. Almost 18 million Kenyans use their mobiles as a bank account to deposit or transfer money and pay their accounts – contributing 8% of GDP.</p><p>Technology startup companies are flourishing in hubs in Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda and South Africa.Internet penetration is still relatively low at 120 million users, but catching up fast: the growth rate between 2000 and 2011 was 2,527%, compared with a world average of 480%. These include around 32 million Facebook users. In all, 27% of African internet users have Facebook profiles, compared with 18% of users in Asia.</p><p>The spread of wireless-equipped coffee shops and shopping malls such as the Accra Mall in Ghana, The Palms in Lagos, Nigeria, and Westgate in Nairobi, Kenya, reflects the rise of the African consumer. Their <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi.aspx\" title=\"\">spending is projected by the McKinsey Global Institute</a> to reach $1.4tn (£900bn) in 2020, up from about $860bn (£550bn) in 2008. Retail giants such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/10/walmart-massmart-south-africa-merger\" title=\"\">Walmart are coming for a piece of the action</a>, as sales of fridges, TVs and mobile phones have surged in virtually every African country in recent years, AfDB says.</p><p>Possession of cars and motorcycles in Ghana, for example, has risen by 81% in the past five years.</p><p>The African middle classes are more likely to have smaller families, own their homes and have salaried jobs or small businesses. They tend to opt for private education and health services and send their children to overseas universities. Some are turning into conspicuous consumers, running up debts on credit cards like their counterparts in the west.</p><p>But it's not all about lifestyles. A web-literate generation, with preoccupations beyond where the next meal is coming from, can self-organise and take on autocratic leaders, as seen in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia this year. Mo Ibrahim, a Sudanese mobile phone entrepreneur and <a href=\"http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en\" title=\"\">campaigner for improved Africa governance</a>, believes the middle class will be an agent of change.</p><p>\"I think they're going to play a crucial role, because it does tend to be the educated young sector of the population, and those guys are better educated than our generation and much much better informed,\" he told the Guardian in  Tunis. \"They're growing up in a society which has lots of media around them – satellites, TV – they watch everything that's going on around the world. You have so many newspapers, you have the internet, you have mobile phones, you have all these things. In our times we had only one newspaper published by the government, one TV channel run by the government.\"</p><p>However, Africa is still the world's poorest continent, with life expectancy in some countries stubbornly below 50. Economic growth does not necessarily mean shared growth: in some cases it means widening inequality, most vividly in South Africa. Nor does it necessarily bring about genuine democracy, as some of Africa's strongest performers – Angola, Ethiopia – are ruled by autocrats.</p><p>Climate change and the threats of deforestation and land-grabbing have not gone away.</p><p>Kofi Annan, a former UN secretary general, warned that the gap between the elites and the majority still has to be bridged. \"We would want to see development that improves the lives of all,\" Annan, now chair of the <a href=\"http://www.africaprogresspanel.org/en\" title=\"\">Africa Progress Panel</a>, told the Guardian. \"That is one of the reasons why we have been stressing the achievement and implementation of the MDGs [millennium development goals] and the governments making sure that the deals they are making for the exploitation of mineral resources, and the benefits that accrue from that, affects the population.</p><p>\"We are not out promoting the establishment of a consumer class. Of course that is part of it, and it creates markets which encourages companies to invest, but the objective is to improve the lot of the entire population.\"</p><p>However, there is once again a \"wind of change blowing through this continent\", albeit different from the one Harold Macmillan was describing in 1960. It can be felt in places such as Maputo in Mozambique, where last year African Medical Investments (AMI) <a href=\"http://www.amiplc.com/index.php?action=healthcare&amp;function=maputo\" title=\"\">opened a private boutique hospital</a> offering the country's first cosmetic surgery, including liposculpture, skin lightening and scar removals.</p><p>\"A lot of it is through political stability,\" said Dr Vivek Solanki, then AMI's chief executive. \"If you look at the wars and famine, it's minimal. Africa has more than 50 nation states,\" said Dr Vivek Solanki, then AMI's chief executive \"and at the moment as we speak there are perhaps three or four countries with warring factions going on.</p><p>Most of Africa has now stabilised,\" he adds\"most of Africa is educated and affluent not only through foreign investment but through local entrepreneurship, local enterprise, local education.</p><p>\"The combination means there has been this burgeoning middle class that's come up and they have demands just like you and me.\"</p><h2>Tycoons and philanthropists<br /></h2><p>With an estimated fortune of $10.1bn (£6.5bn), the Nigerian cement tycoon Aliko Dangote is Africa's richest man and one of the continent's 16 billionaires. The South African diamond magnate Nicky Oppenheimer – who also owns the country's largest private game park, the Tswalu Kalahari reserve – comes second, with a $6.5bn fortune. According to Forbes, Patrice Motsepe, a 40-year-old mining magnate, is South Africa's first and only black billionaire, with $2.5bn.</p><p>In November the magazine published its inaugural list of the \"40 richest Africans\", which it called \"a testament to the growing global importance of the continent\". Together, the combined wealth of Africa's 40 richest is $64.9bn – roughly twice the GDP of Kenya ($32bn) or Ghana ($31bn) in 2010.</p><p>Though many of the continent's countries remain among the poorest in the world, there are now more than 100,000 Africans with at least $1m to invest, according to the consultants Merrill Lynch and Capgemini. This year's World Wealth Report says the number of Africa's super-rich grew by 11.1% in 2010 – faster than in any other region. What's more, the report says, their combined wealth grew by 13.6% last year, to $1.2 trillion.</p><p>Some of Africa's wealthiest are also philanthropists: Dangote gave millions to a fund for small businesses in Nigeria last year, and Theophilus Danjuma, an oil tycoon, put aside $100m for NGOs working in the country.</p><p>According to a 2010 report from Barclays Bank, South Africa's super-rich are among the most generous in the world – second only to those in the US.</p><p>But the OECD has warned middle-income countries such as South Africa to keep a close eye on their top earners and the dangers of rising inequalities. Others note that, while they don't appear on Forbes's rich list, many of the richest people may well be former and current leaders of African countries.</p><p><strong>Claire Provost</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/25/1324843463209/African-middle-class-fami-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/25/africas-middle-class-hope-continent","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/dec/25/africas-middle-class-hope-continent","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Global development voices: Living with disabilities","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-15T12:41:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2011/dec/15/disability-voices-development","fields":{"body":"<h2><a name=\"A\">Antenor Ruperto Montalvan Miranda, 66, lives in Lima, Peru</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269250'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879176420/Antenor_-_Peru.jpg' alt='Antenor Ruperto Montalvan Miranda' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>My life completely changed when I had the road accident. I was forced to use a wheelchair and found a whole series of obstacles. There are no ramps in my neighbourhood. Because of my accident I couldn't attend medical school. Work tables at the university were not accessible to people with restrictive mobility like me. Moving around town was a drama – taxi drivers didn't want to take my wheelchair. It was a shock to discover that the city was not ready for people with disabilities. At least some streets now have ramps. We are asking our authorities to change, and we're slowly winning some battles.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>Peru's constitution does recognise that disabled people have rights and are entitled to equality of opportunity and respect. Regulations are abundant here, but we have a weakness when it comes to applying and respecting our laws. About 90% of the more than 3 million Peruvians who have a disability can't get an education – because of their disability. There is a lot of illiteracy among them, and that's because the government has yet to implement inclusive policies. .</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>We can learn from some of the positive experiences in Europe. Here, if your child has Down's syndrome, for example, it's seen as a shameful stigma, a fatality, a punishment from God. But I believe change should be part of a process we need to go through on our own. As a society, we need to bring in new leaders with a different mentality and a long-term view, to build a country that welcomes all people. That's the deficit we have in underdeveloped countries, unlike in Europe where they have a different mentality.</p><h2><a name=\"B\">Teddy Hotto Quispe Velasco, 37, lives in El Alto, Bolivia</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269251'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879225862/Teddy_-_Bolivia.jpg' alt='Teddy Hotto Quispe Velasco' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I just wanted to die after I had my amputation.

But I'm much happier now, after I got a prosthetic leg. People can't tell that I have a fake limb. I can walk normally, like before. And I got a job at a French bakery.

What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>I wish the government would give financial help to disabled people, because they suffer a lot. People treat you differently. Even the way they look at you is different. They don't tell you straight to your face, but they don't want to get near you. After my leg was amputated, I suffered a lot of discrimination. I don't know what I would have done if it hadn't been for a lot of the support I got from some people, and the help I got from the Rotary Club, which gave me a free prosthetic limb.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>I can understand what they go through now. I'm not well-informed, but countries with more money should help Bolivia. And organisations like the Rotary Club should also help where the government can't. People with disabilities should get help, because they can't go to work. For example, buses don't stop for you if they see that you're an amputee, because they think you're going to take up more room with your crutches.</p><h2><a name=\"C\">Sonia Malca Silva, 60, lives in Lima, Peru</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269252'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879261467/Sonia_-_Peru.jpg' alt='Sonia Malca Silva' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When I was born, there were no services or support for people like me. When I first went to school, my hearing loss hadn't been detected, but my physical impediment was evident as I had crutches. I had to learn how to read on my own, through necessity, watching people's lips when they read. At first I suffered discrimination from my teachers and from the other children, because they didn't realise I couldn't hear. I had to adapt to my school environment, and not the other way around. Now there are special schools for deaf people and help with rehabilitation. But those who live outside cities are forgotten. Their parents don't send them to school, and when they do, they don't find adequate teachers.</p><p>But despite these difficulties, I managed to finish school and then studied further … finally becoming a doctor. I now work as a pathologist, diagnosing cancer at a Lima hospital.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>We're still very much behind. Five out of 1,000 children are born deaf. Our government should carry out checks to see if newborn children can hear, but they don't do it. By the time they realise they're deaf, it's too late for them to learn how to speak. And if they don't learn how to speak, they become a lifelong burden for their family. Or worse, they become marginalised and do whatever they can to make ends meet – often stealing, for example. If we had a deafness detection programme, and we gave these children hearing aids from early on, they could be integrated into society. I don't think it would involve a lot of money.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>We definitely need help. If money is short at the national level, these programmes could be financed by the international community and donor countries. But aid countries now want to abandon Peru because they think that we are doing well economically. A lot of information is being distorted. We still have problems to resolve on how to integrate marginalised groups like people with disabilities. It's not yet time for international aid to end.</p><h2><a name=\"D\">Manisha, 15, lives in Sarupe Ka Tala, in Rajasthan, India</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269253'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879280212/Manisha_-_India.jpg' alt='Manisha' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>There are many challenges I face in my daily life; the big one is mobility, as many places are not accessible. I don't get as much freedom as I'd like from my family because of this, and they are also worried about my safety. I live in a desert area, so shifting sand dunes are another difficulty. Getting information is another challenge. Newspapers are not supplied in our community, but I do receive a newspaper in braille, which I read out to my neighbours – sometimes this is the only news we have.</p><p>I do think my status within my family and my society has improved from when I was younger. The attitude of my community is changing – people know now that blind children like me can go to school and study – though I think a full change of thinking will still take time. Right now I am going to a government school, but my schoolteacher doesn't know braille so I am taught by a visiting teacher, who is also training my teacher in school to support me. Before <a href=\"http://www.sightsavers.org/\" title=\"\">Sightsavers</a> came to my community, children like me were not admitted into schools.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>I know the government has a programme called Sarve Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All) and that there is a law in the country called the Right to Education Act since last year. So I know that education has become a right of all children. However, at the same time, there are still very few educators who can support the needs of children like me. I have heard that India is going to have a new law for disabled people, for our benefits and rights. What I really want is for the government to train more special teachers and provide us with things like a braille library and audiobooks, even in remote areas like ours. Disabled children need to be given due importance.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>The international community should support education with its expertise in the field of technology, especially technology that helps people living with disabilities. Education is what can help children like me move forward with life. Before I went to school, I was always at home and dependent on others, but now my life is very different. I often speak out on social issues, and now help other blind children to be more independent.</p><h2><a name=\"E\">Washington Opiyo Sati, 31, lives in Nairobi, Kenya</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269254'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879313502/Washington_-_Kenya.jpg' alt='Washington Opiyo Sati' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In Kenya, disabled people continue to experience social exclusion irrespective of the fact that there are a number of national laws and policies to promote and protect their rights. For example, as a deaf person, I face difficulty in accessing information as most of the media, especially television, do not have interpretation services in their programmes – including subtitles. Access to employment is a big headache for me because most employers are not ready to hire sign language interpreters. Disabled people face widespread barriers in accessing education, transport, healthcare, employment and access to information.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>Kenya's new constitution has a number of provisions for people with disabilities in terms of promoting and protecting their human rights and fundamental freedoms. The government has initiated a wide range of social protection programmes, notably cash transfers for children with severe disabilities and a national disability fund for economic empowerment. The government has also enacted laws and policies to protect people with disabilities There is a need to implement existing policies and laws to ensure disabled people enjoy their human rights as well as participate fully in society. It is essential for the government to roll out social protection programmes across the country. There is also a need to educate the general public through awareness-raising programmes to ensure that the inherent dignity of disabled people is respected and promoted.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country? </strong></h2><p>The international community should push the government to fulfil the commitment made under the UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities and other human rights conventions. In terms of funding, there should be conditions that government and civil society organisations will not be granted funds if their projects don't consider disability. The international community should also build the capacity of disabled people by funding their projects.</p><p>Washington works for <a href=\"lcd-enar.org\">Leonard Cheshire Disability East and North Africa</a>.</p><h2><a name=\"F\">Carlos Mariaca Alvarez, 42, lives in La Paz, Bolivia</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269255'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879372136/Carlos_Bolivia.jpg' alt='Carlos Mariaca Alvarez' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I have been in a wheelchair since I was a child, and for more than 30 years most of my body has been paralysed because of illness.<strong> </strong>I have to rely on my family for every daily need.<strong> </strong>My mother has to help me move around the house. Having a disability here means being marginalised, excluded, and without basic human rights. It is very difficult in all these contexts, because of architectural barriers, social barriers, cultural barriers, attitudinal barriers, all of which force us to live completely isolated from society. On top of that, being confined to a wheelchair in Bolivia comes with great stigma  attached. These are challenges we had in the past, and that we still have. Not much has changed, unfortunately.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>We were hoping for more inclusion with the government of Evo Morales, because he talked about multiculturalism and multidimensionality. However, Morales speaks up for farmers and indigenous people, but not for those with a disability, or for the elderly, street children or for sexual diversity. When we protested outside the ministry of justice, the government sent the police and forcibly removed us, just because we were asking for our rights to be respected.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>I think our government should be the one to help us first. We are asking for a state benefit of 3,500 bolivianos (around $500) for people with severe disabilities, and for a welfare programme to improve opportunities in areas of education, health, employment and housing. Because, otherwise, people with disabilities remain a financial burden to their family. Nothing will stop us. We're only asking for the rights of our brothers and sisters to be respected, and for government discrimination to end.

Discriminated against, they are not considered as a person in their own right. They are called<em> \"ibimuga\"</em>, which means \"broken pots\" – useless people without a future. Disabled people face many obstacles linked to prejudices and popular beliefs. There are also accessibility issues. Public transport is not adapted at all and brings a lot of hassle on a daily basis. Disabled people do not have equal access to education, health and information. Their fundamental rights are not respected.</p><p>A certain change in mindset is happening thanks to the work of organisations like <a href=\"http://www.handicap-international.org/\">Handicap International</a> and the creation of <a href=\"http://www.raphb.org\" title=\"\">RAPHB</a>, a network of disabled people's organisations, which I work for. RAPHB's members run local and national activities aimed at changing people's perceptions. When I was growing up, and because of my physical impairment after having polio as a child, opportunities were very limited. A disabled child couldn't go to a mainstream school or access health services. Their family would try to hide them so that the local community wouldn't know that the family was \"cursed\". Today, a disabled child is seen as more equal to other children. But much remains to be done.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>RAPHB has a partnership with the ministry for solidarity, which is responsible for people with disabilities. In 2010, the ministry funded income-generating projects for associations and centres for disabled people. The ministry of public health committed to provide care to all children under five, including disabled children. It is trying to set up an inclusive education system with the support of Handicap International.</p><p>Sadly, despite some positive action by the government, there are no policies or laws regarding disabled people, and the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities has not been ratified yet. There are so many issues to address – such as even the offices of the ministry for solidarity are on the third floor, with no lift.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>I believe the international community should get the Burundi government to ratify the convention and promulgate laws supporting it. Disabled people's organisations and the international NGOs working on disability issues in Burundi need support. Finally, the international community should demand that the government commit to the inclusion of disability in all development policies.</p><h2><a name=\"H\">Ruth Acheinegeh, 32, lives in Bamenda, Northwest Region, Cameroon</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269257'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879483166/Ruth_-_Cameroon.jpg' alt='Ruth Acheinegeh' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>People with disabilities in Cameroon face many challenges. The percentage of those receiving education is very low and those in this region still lack good medical care to improve their impairment. In terms of social acceptance, there is more talk about social inclusion and many more people are aware of it, but the practical aspect of including people in social activity is limited. The biggest challenge I faced, having a physical mobility impairment, was being part of society … having a disability impacted on making friends. Things have improved in my lifetime, but there is a still a lot more needed as far as rehabilitating children with disability goes.</p><p>A big challenge is accessibility to basically everywhere.<strong> </strong>And the business environment is not that accessible. Setting up a business was much more challenging for me than it would have been for someone else. From society's perspective, \"normal\" people can go into business, but people don't want to bother me in my shop because I have difficulty moving around in it.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>Right now there are policies of exemption from school fees that are really practical, and we have a good number of documented policies – but the implementation part is still hanging. I want the universal declaration of human rights to be ratified in Cameroon, because if it is ratified it can be implemented.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>The international community should have a channel to liaise with grassroots organisations to see what difficulties they are facing – that's the first thing they should do. There should also be a link to diplomacy because disability is not always discussed as a matter of diplomacy. To have a disability component would push ahead many of the rights. Society across the world should know that disability exists not only with the person who has an impairment but also with the mindset of other individuals. The mindset to accept every person – whatever that person might be – would go a long way towards bridging the gap between able-bodied people and people with disability.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.icdr.utoronto.ca/Site/CAMEROON WORKING GROUP.php\">Bamenda Coordinating Centre for Studies in Disability and Rehabilitation</a>.</p><h2><a name=\"I\">Raghunath Mohanty, 68, lives in Koraput district, Odisha state, India</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269258'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879515619/Raghunath_-_India.jpg' alt='Raghunath Mohanty' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>People who are born with or develop general disabilities are accepted in our society. But it's an entirely different case when it comes to leprosy. During my youth, people with leprosy were outcasts, they were driven from their villages and their houses burnt down. They used to live by themselves in secluded places. Even their families used to send them away, fearing isolation from the rest of the community. If one member of a family was affected by leprosy then marriage became impossible for other family members. Children with leprosy were barred from attending schools.</p><p>I had to move from one village to another during the course of treatment for leprosy because of widespread stigma and discrimination. Now, gradually, attitudes are changing and people are far more tolerant of leprosy-affected people like me. Overall, awareness has increased and most people now know that leprosy is curable. But still, we come across incidents of forced seclusion in some places. Such incidents are now fewer because of efforts from NGOs like <a href=\"http://www.leprahealthinaction.org/\" title=\"\">Lepra</a>. Medicines are available in government hospitals, but stigma still prevails among healthcare providers. People with leprosy are unable to get treatment for ulcers and other deformities from government hospitals. Treatment is vital to prevent infection, which can result in the shortening of fingers and toes, and the need for amputation.</p><p>Now, at this age, I have become a volunteer in one of Lepra's projects and arrange awareness programmes in different villages. My fellow villagers have come to accept me because of this work.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>The government provides 200 rupees (around $4) a month as a disability pension. Camps are organised where disabled people can get a disability certificate, identity cards and income certificates. Aids and appliances like tricycles, wheelchairs, footwear, splints etc are also provided to people affected by disability. A scholarship scheme is available for students. But most leprosy affected people are not able to get disability certificates and thus cannot avail these facilities.</p><p>I would like to see all leprosy-affected people get these facilities in a proper way. Below poverty line cards should be provided to all leprosy-affected people so that they can access government benefits. Bank loans should be provided for starting small businesses, as most of the affected people cannot do agricultural work due to deformities. Door-to-door surveys should be reinitiated for identification of leprosy and treatment. Our government also needs to fight stigma and discrimination. In many states of India, laws still exist that prevent leprosy-affected people from contesting elections for local bodies. Almost all the marriage and divorce laws of the country make leprosy a ground for divorce. The  government should repeal all these discriminating acts and laws.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>From time to time I get opportunities to participate in district- and state-level programmes on leprosy. Through discussions, I have come to know that leprosy is no longer a priority problem and thus funds from our government and international agencies are reducing day by day. On the other hand, the prevalence rate in our state is increasing and we do not have the necessary funds and strategy to deal with the situation. I sincerely hope that the government and the international community prioritise this menace.</p><h2><a name=\"J\">Nay Win Tun, 32, lives in Rangoon, Burma</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269259'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879842277/NayWinTun_crop_.jpg' alt='Nay Win Tun' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I have been challenged from the effects of polio since the age of one.

One day I inquired about a job advertised by a private company and was told that there wasn't a job, yet when an able-bodied person applied he was told the job was still available. I also face practical issues related to my disability on a daily basis:  using buses and public transport, which are not designed for disabled people, makes getting to work a huge challenge, as climbing steps is difficult. If you use a wheelchair in Burma, it is almost impossible to use public transport or access public buildings.</p><p>Through TLM's programmes I am also aware that disabled people living in rural areas face big challenges.  For example, many are confined to their homes during the rainy season, as without raised footpaths their access to community facilities is impossible.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>Information and services for disabled people were limited or nonexistent prior to Cyclone Nargis, which hit the Irrawaddy Delta in May 2008. Following the cyclone, a nationwide disability survey showed that 2.3%, around 1.3 million people, were living with a disability. Yet services and support for people with disabilities only exist in the cities.</p><p>Recent political changes here are beginning to recognise some of our needs, and there has been an improvement in media coverage of disability issues. The government is also taking steps to sign the UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities and is drafting disability legislation in accordance with the convention.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>Prior to the political changes the rights of people with disabilities were not recognised or addressed. However, current evidence points to the new civilian government showing increased commitment to poverty alleviation and development. To support this change, the international community needs to put a greater emphasis on including people with disabilities in the development process. NGOs need to integrate people with disabilities, including those affected by leprosy, in all their programmes. Governments and other donors should make the inclusion of disabled people an essential criterion for funding.</p><h2><a name=\"K\">Thomas Alieu, 39, lives in Freetown, Sierra Leone</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269260'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879552617/Thomas_-_Sierra_Leone.jpg' alt='Thomas Alieu' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I could have been the first blind attorney in my country, having studied law into a third year, but I was forced to drop out because there were simply no braille materials after a certain level. No matter how intelligent a disabled person is, our society always sees you as a liability. Your own parents may consider you good-for-nothing just because you are blind or disabled.</p><p>Life is difficult for the disabled in Sierra Leone, especially if you are blind. We are frequently turned away from public transport. Roads, buildings and other infrastructure are not disabled-friendly. But perhaps the biggest problem is the social stigma towards disability. Frequently, parents of disabled children do not send them to school and end up confining them to the four walls of their home. Of the 15% of Sierra Leonians who are disabled, only 2% are educated. As a result, many of the disabled are offered no real choice by society to fend for themselves – except to beg on the streets.</p><p>I run a small centre for the blind, offering technology access and material. We do not have a lot of modern technology – most of our computers are old, donated machines.

What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>Health services are scarce, even for the non-disabled population. As a result, those of us with disabilities, who are already poorer than the average Sierra Leonian, can expect to have poorer facilities. It is only in 2011 that Sierra Leone enacted a Persons With Disability Act, which, if implemented, will offer equal rights to education, medication and non-discrimination in employment. I believe disabled people must embark on advocacy and raising awareness on a local and national level to ensure full implementation of the act.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>I would like to see the international community actively engage the government of Sierra Leone and other stakeholders on disability issues for the full implementation of the provisions of the 2011 disability act and ensure that disability rights are equated to human rights.

Everyday life is complicated, and disabled people must fight harder than others in an environment marred by poverty, where actually everyone is fighting for survival. Social participation of disabled people has improved a lot in recent years, thanks in part to awareness-raising activities organised by <a href=\"http://www.handicap-international.org/\" title=\"\">Handicap International</a>, which I work for. Together with local partners, we use tools such as videos and interactive drawings suitable for illiterate people to get them to think about how the community treats disabled people.</p><p>Our messages are very well received. You can quickly see a big difference in the way disabled people are perceived in their community. Disabled children come out of where they have been hidden by relatives. At the same time, important lobbying work is being done with the authorities. All this results in more and more parents sending their children to school so that it will be easier for the younger generation to have work opportunities. But a lot remains to be done, as awareness-raising activities have not reached the whole of the country.</p><p>Getting married is also extremely difficult for disabled people. Togo is an agricultural country where both men and women must work in the fields.</p><p>But there are some success stories – just look at me! In these cases, there are spouses who have understood that, despite appearances, disability is in fact minor. With a little bit of help and some adaptations, disabled people can live, work and be productive just like everybody else. They can contribute to family life and raise children. I had two boys and a girl and I brought them up without a problem, with lots of happiness, just like any other woman.</p><p>I still face other people's prejudices. Luckily, my parents taught me early on to be self-confident and to have self-esteem. So most of the time I manage to ignore these negative opinions about me. I know that I deserve my place with and among other people.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>At governmental level, Togo has had a department for people with disabilities within the ministry for social action since 1995. In 2004, a law was passed to give social protection to disabled people, and Togo ratified the convention on the rights of people with disabilities this March. These various legal instruments must be implemented through national policies. Our country must go beyond occasional actions and get a system in place that guarantees the sustainability of measures set up to enable disabled people to lead a normal life.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>The international community must remind our government of the need to honour the commitments made when ratifying conventions. Signing texts is all very well, but putting them into practice in everyday life is another thing. And on this point there is still a lot to do. Disabled people and NGOs try to move things in the right direction. The international community should also support the initiatives of civil society by providing the financial and technical resources needed to increase the speed of change.</p><h2><a name=\"M\">Ana Ruth Merida,  27, lives in Guatemala City, Guatemala</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269262'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879610804/Ana-_Guatemala.jpg' alt='Ana Ruth Merida' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I am a blind woman and a lawyer. I became blind at the age of 12, and since then have faced challenges in my education. With close support from my family, I was able to finish secondary school and go to university, becoming the first blind lawyer who also obtained the professional degree of notary in Guatemala. I highlight this achievement because the code of notaries includes a legal disposition that prohibits blind people from becoming notaries.</p><p>Living with a disability in Guatemala, I face a great deal of discrimination and many challenges. I think that for a child with a disability it is fundamental that they have the necessary family support, and that family members be fully aware that a person with a disability can do many things. If a person growing up with a disability doesn't have this fundamental support from the family, they are condemned to isolation and exclusion.</p><p>Social perceptions, access to basic rights such as health, public transportation and work, are still enormous challenges. And access to education is still a right that is not available in most parts of the country.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>State institutions have done very little to improve living conditions for people with disabilities. Guatemala recently had presidential elections, and none of the candidates included disability in their governmental plans. The newly elected president has not even mentioned it.  There is the National Council for the Disabled, but its work is very poor. It has mainly promoted some awareness campaigns, but that is not enough: legislation must be complied with and no state institutions seem to be moving forward with this.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>International co-operation should make any support it provides to any state institution –  whatever the funding is provided for – conditional on it mainstreaming disability. Co-operation has not focused on disabled people's organisations. And, besides providing financial support, the aid agencies should also create a local office and implement their own projects as well as monitor those they fund.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://colectivovidaindependiente.org\">Colectivo Vida Independiente de Guatemala</a>.</p><h2><a name=\"N\">Samuel Nyincho, 39, lives in Big Babanki, Northwest Region, Cameroon</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420269263'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/14/1323879633643/Samuel_Cameroon.jpg' alt='Samuel Nyincho' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Life's a big challenge because there are still a lot of needs of disabled people that aren't met. Society still sees people with disabilities as a liability, and as people who just need charity. Stigmatisation is quite high. In my lifetime, and being visually impaired, I would say awareness has improved – but not much else, really. Accessing education is difficult because if you look at the statistics only 2% of disabled people have formal education. We would appreciate initiatives to introduce inclusive education. Healthcare services are one of the greatest challenges. If you go to the regional hospital, getting your rights respected is difficult.</p><p>There are more opportunities available now for disabled people, but the challenges are still enormous. There are more centres and rehabilitation programmes, and people with disabilities are standing up for their rights. Of the challenges they face now, most of it is physical, such as infrastructure. If you look at the way classrooms are constructed they don't really consider the accessibility..  We have taken initiatives to address these challenges, and we appreciate the efforts of private institutions and service providers who are trying to improve the quality of life for disabled people.</p><h2><strong>What steps are being taken in your country to improve the lives of disabled people? What policy or activity would you like to see your country introduce?</strong></h2><p>The government in Cameroon passed a law in 2010 for the protection of disabled people. The biggest challenge is at the level of implementing those policies. Even in the creation of these policies to support us, there are no disabled people at the institutions where the policies are developed. The state needs to ratify the universal declaration of human rights and we need to be present and to participate in policy-making and implementation.</p><h2><strong>What should the international community do to help improve the lives of disabled people in your country?</strong></h2><p>The international community should recognise disabled people as the authentic voice that should dictate the pace at which things are done. They should also direct their attention to working with disabled people's organisations on the ground.</p><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.icdr.utoronto.ca/Site/CAMEROON WORKING GROUP.php\">Bamenda Coordinating Centre for Studies in Disability and Rehabilitation</a>.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/dec/15/disability-voices-development","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2011/dec/15/disability-voices-development","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Journalists killed since 1992","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-14T08:30:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2010/jan/11/journalists-killed-list-data","fields":{"body":"<p>Pakistan remained the most dangerous country for journalists with more deaths recorded there than any other country according to the <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/killed/2011/\">Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)</a>.</p><p>Of the 42 killings with a confirmed motive, seven of those were in Pakistan down slightly from 2010.

world remains a deeply entrenched, global concern according to <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/cpi\">Transparency International's 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)</a> - the world's most credible measure of of domestic, public sector corruption. </p><p>This year, two thirds of countries covered by the index were given scores less than 5 - which means they are considered significantly corrupt.</p><p>The CPI scores countries on a scale of zero to 10, with zero indicating high levels of corruption and 10, low levels.  And the most corrupt places in the world are not the most surprising. Unstable governments, often with a legacy of conflict, continue to dominate the bottom rungs of the CPI. Afghanistan and Myanmar share second to last place with a score of 1.5, with Somalia and North Korea - measured for the first time - coming in last with a score of 1.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-382791261'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2011/11/30/1322676740295/World-corruption-index-in-007.jpg' alt='World corruption index interactive map' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>World corruption index interactive map. <b>Click image to explore it</b></figcaption></figure><p><strong></strong></p><p>The world's most peaceful countries score the best. In the 2011 CPI, New Zealand is top with a score of 9.5, followed by Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Singapore. </p><p>Four countries and territories besides North Korea are included for the first time: the Bahamas, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname. </p><p>Transparency International (TI) chair Huguette Labelle says corruption remains a major global issue, highlighted by widespread demonstrations in 2011: \"This year we have seen corruption on protestor's banners be they rich or poor. Whether in a Europe hit by debt crisis or an Arab world starting a new political era, leaders must head the demands for better government.\"</p><p>Wealth seems no easy antidote to corruption: some relatively rich countries, including Russia, fall at the bottom of the global league table. Meanwhile, some of the world's poorer states do comparatively well: Botswana, Bhutan, Cape Verde, and Rwanda all appear among the 50 \"cleanest\" countries.</p><p>While the index has been published annually since 1995, TI warns against comparing scores over time, as sources for the index change each year.  However, the Berlin-based NGO notes that two general trends pop out regardless: Arab Spring countries, and many Eurozone countries – particularly those affected by the financial crisis – are doing worse and worse.</p><p>Most Arab Spring countries rank in the lower half of the index, with scores below 4. Many of the lowest-scoring European countries are those hardest hit by the financial and debt crises – including Greece and Italy.</p><p>The UK ranks 16th, along with Austria and the Barbados, and just ahead of Belgium and Ireland. The US ranks 24th.</p><p>The Index, which is closely watched by investors, economists, and civil society campaigners, is based on expert assessments and data from 17 surveys from 13 independent institutions, covering issues such as access to information, bribery of public officials, kickbacks in public procurement, and the  enforcement of anti-corruption laws. While critics note that measuring perceptions of corruption is not the same as measuring corruption itself, the latter is almost impossible to do - as the corrupt are usually keen to cover up their tracks, hard data on graft and bribery is notoriously difficult to come by.</p><p>We've got the full data <a href=\"#data\">below</a>.

old black-and-white photograph taken in 1944 at the conference in Bretton Woods that gave birth to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows men in grey suits meeting to design the future multilateral system. Fast-forward 67 years to a community a few kilometres west of the capital of Tanzania, where local residents are using GPS devices to collect public data on the delivery of local services – schools, health clinics, public toilets and rubbish dumps – so the information can be uploaded to an online data map, ultimately holding their government accountable.</p><p>As government ministers, international aid organisations, non-government organisations, foundations and others gather in Busan, South Korea, for the <a href=\"http://www.aideffectiveness.org/busanhlf4/\" title=\"\">fourth high-level forum on aid effectiveness</a> to discuss the future of aid co-ordination, one thing is clear: the development future doesn't lie with men in dark suits behind closed doors. Not only are developing countries now providing two-thirds of global growth, turning the old north-south aid paradigm on its head, but it is becoming clearer that effective development needs the participation not just of governments but of beneficiaries, local communities and citizens more broadly. And with 21st-century technology, we now have the means to make it happen.</p><p>It was the use of the internet – an interactive platform called <a href=\"http://www.checkmyschool.org/\" title=\"\">checkmyschool.org</a> – that saw an elementary school principal in Leyte province in the Philippines get much-needed building work to resume at her school, damaged by a natural disaster. The principal went online and lodged a complaint about the delay, fearing corrupt procurement practices were responsible. Her complaint prompted a speedy response. The work was completed and 800 students were given a new school roof.</p><p>It was via <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZYm0kEvkAo\" title=\"\">SMS messages from cellphones</a> that citizens in the conflict-affected province of South Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were able to vote for local budget priorities, to break a vicious cycle of mistrust and poorly performing services. As a result, for the first time in decades, local budgets started to include investments in local communities providing basic services to the poor, and in response, citizens started to pay taxes.</p><p>These moves to transparency – giving citizens access to information – gives 21st-century meaning to the saying \"knowledge is power\".</p><p>And the power of knowledge can spread even further: transparency breeds accountability and a focus on results – for the taxpayer a sense that aid monies are being used wisely, for the citizen a sense that government is doing the right thing. The tranparency spotlight has already been on donors. The UK-based coalition of civil society organisations working on governance, aid effectiveness, and access to information, <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/\" title=\"\">Publish What You Fund</a>, has just released its <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/resources/index/2011-index/\" title=\"\">aid transparency index</a> rating 58 international and bilateral donors and ranking the World Bank as most transparent. But before we become too self-congratulory, let's recall its overall message: some donors do well, all donors can do better.</p><p>Perhaps we can take some heart from another <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/section/topics/aid_effectiveness/quoda\" title=\"\">study on aid quality released this month</a>, as a nudge to Busan. The Centre for Global Development and the Brookings Institution found the World Bank's fund for the poorest, the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/ida/\" title=\"\">International Development Association</a>, the UK and Ireland all scored in the top 10. And the study found, because of greater commitments to transparency, the area in which donors make the most improvement was in transparency and learning.</p><p>We've all learned that there's no one size fits all answer to development. As the Busan gathering will illustrate, no one has a monopoly on development. We're seeing the lessons learned in the developing world transcend borders – Rwanda was inspired by China's successful move to terrace-degraded hillsides; Colombia's model for mass transit has been copied widely; and India's model for information communication technologies is being studied across the African continent.</p><p>Truly democratising development means seizing all the opportunities offered by information communication technologies. It was a prime motivation behind the World Bank's move more than a year ago to open up its data banks. New web-based and mobile tools make it easier for the public to find, use and download bank data in five languages. Rich or poor, from the developed or the developing world, people have the tools to play a role in devising development solutions.</p><p>Developing countries, too, are seeing value in opening up their data. Kenya this year became the first country on the African continent to launch a national <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jul/13/kenya-open-data-initiative\" title=\"\">open data initiative</a>. It took just three weeks. Now it's possible for anyone to obtain census or budget data, check on spending at the county level or even find a nearby health facility. Moldova has done the same. Other nations such as Mongolia, Nigeria and Rwanda want to follow suit.</p><p>Transparency isn't just about following the money trail from the top down. An equally important part of the equation is looking at the delivery of aid from the ground up – examining ways to provide citizens not only the knowledge about what's being delivered by development dollars but also the means to act upon that knowledge to help find and monitor development solutions.</p><p>And there's a double-win. Transparency and citizen involvement are not only a check on corruption, they can also be mobilised to improve development outcomes. Take Uganda where health workers at 50 health centres across the country were inspired to work harder after community monitoring – via citizen score cards. The result: a 33% drop in child mortality in the centres.</p><p>A key lesson of the Arab spring was that citizens' voice must be an integral part of development. It's a lesson we should heed. Investments that give voice to people are just as vital as money. Information and participation are as valuable as dollars if we want development assistance to be truly effective.</p><p>• <em>Caroline Anstey is managing director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/\" title=\"\"><em>World Bank</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/11/25/1322239068205/Henry-Morgenthau-Jr-speak-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/nov/29/technology-can-democractise-development","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/nov/29/technology-can-democractise-development","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Books of the year 2011","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-25T18:27:56Z","sectionId":"books","id":"books/2011/nov/25/books-of-the-year","fields":{"body":"<h2><strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/chimamandangoziadichie\" title=\"\"><strong>Chimamanda Adichie</strong></a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-382393632'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2011/11/25/1322239381492/On-Canaans-Side.jpg' alt='Sebastian Barry, On Canaan's Side' width='84' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I admired the lovely sentences and moving story in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jul/20/on-canaans-side-sebastian-barry-review\" title=\"\">Sebastian Barry's <strong>On Canaan's Side</strong> (Faber)</a>, about an Irish-American woman looking back at her life. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/history/9781847080219/one-day-i-will-write-about-this-place\" title=\"\">Binyavanga Wainaina's <strong>One Day I Will Write About This Place</strong></a> (Granta) is a strange, allusive, tender memoir about growing up in middle-class Kenya.

The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/david-foster-wallace\" title=\"\">David Foster Wallace</a> influence seemed so pronounced, there was the conspicuously dubious taste and a fondness for deranged critical hyperbole – I mean, who would even bother to listen to Guns N' Roses, let alone claim that Axl Rose achieved \"the greatest white male rock dance moment of the video age\"? But then I thought: hey, what a great category of praise to invent! By then the DFW doubt had retired itself and JJS's prose was working its own hard-to-fathom magic. It has a ramshackle loquacity, a down-home hyper-eloquence and an off-the-wallishness that is almost lapidary. I'm still puzzling my way though the life – Sullivan was born and lives in the American South; as a teen he went through an evangelical Christian phase (beautifully revealed in  the opening piece, \"Upon this Rock\") – and the writing that's resulting from it, but am feeling the way publishers do when they come across a new voice, fully formed and quite distinctive.

It's also – though Davies is too civilised and graceful a writer to labour the point – a warning. \"Successful statehood,\" he writes, \"is, in fact, a rare blessing.\" I only wish that this wonderfully exhilarating and melancholy book would be read by our leaders, and borne in mind when they next consider exporting our accidentally successful arrangements by military force to some other country.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/david-hare\" title=\"\"><strong>David Hare</strong></a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-382393646'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2011/11/25/1322241990911/A-Long-Lunch-My-Stories-and-.jpg' alt='Simon Hoggart, A Long Lunch: My Stories and I'm Sticking to Them' width='84' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The title of the biggest ego in American letters is never anyone's for long, but with her shameless book of essays <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/apr/23/terry-castle-the-professor-review\" title=\"\"><strong>The Professor and Other Writings</strong></a> (Harper) Terry Castle grabs the crown and hugs it to her.

Two novels published this year have particularly lingered in my mind: David Lodge's portrait of HG Wells,<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781846554964/a-man-of-parts\" title=\"\"><strong>A Man of Parts</strong></a> (Harvill Secker), succeeded in fusing the best bits of fiction and biography to bring the man and his erotic adventures to life; and Justin Cartwright's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781408803882/other-peoples-money\" title=\"\"><strong>Other People's Money</strong> </a>(Bloomsbury) created a believable, fictional private bank on the brink of destruction.

Unaccountably neglected, Göran Therborn's <strong>The World: A Beginners Guide</strong> (Polity), a survey of the present state, problems and outlook of the globe by a Swedish master sociologist, is one of the rare books that lives up to its title. It is lucid, intelligent about the future and admirably researched. The book I have enjoyed most is Karl Miller's <strong>Tretower to Clyro</strong> (Quercus), a collection of characteristically pawky essays by one of the great literary editors of our time, combined with a wonderful account of explorations à trois of the Celtic parts of Great Britain.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/alanhollinghurst\" title=\"\"><strong>Alan Hollinghurst</strong></a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-382393649'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2011/11/25/1322242219943/Nikolaus-Pevsner-The-Life.jpg' alt='Susie Harries, Nikolaus Pevsner: The Life' width='84' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Two books this year gave me the almost dreamlike pleasure of finding out things that I'd long wanted to know. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/sep/09/nikolaus-pevsner-life-harries-review\" title=\"\">Susie Harries's <strong>Nikolaus Pevsner</strong> (Chatto)</a> may justly be subtitled \"The Life\": it shows a complete mastery of the many different areas, cultural, political and artistic, in which this complex and essential figure moved and made his mark.

In \"The Curious Case of Bapsy Pavry\", an Indian lady who became the Marchioness of Winchester and lived out a long widowhood in a Firbankian fantasy of social aspiration is chased down with a tenderly marvelling mordancy that is a keynote of Fallowell's brilliant and haunting book<strong>.</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/michael-holroyd\" title=\"\"><strong>Michael Holroyd</strong></a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-382393650'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2011/6/20/1308574719144/The-Strangers-Child.jpg' alt='Alan Hollinghurst, The Stranger's Child' width='84' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Alan Hollinghurst's novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jun/17/strangers-child-alan-hollinghurst-review\" title=\"\"><strong>The Stranger's Child</strong></a> tracks the cultural, sexual, biographical and social changes that took place in 20th-century Britain.

In <em>Wild Abandon</em> it's communal living that causes all the trouble, in <em>The Family Fang</em> it's performance art; both books are populated by flawed, occasionally exasperating, lovable and, above all, thoroughly imagined characters. James Hynes's <strong>Next</strong> (Reagan Arthur) is, mystifyingly, still without a publisher in the UK, but don't let that put you off. It's dark, comic, real and, in the end, terrifying, and there are many, many men in their late 40s and 50s who would wince with recognition at Hynes's Kevin Quinn.</p><p>Hampton Sides's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jun/06/hellbound-trail-hampton-sides\" title=\"\"><strong>Hellhound on His Trail </strong>(Allen Lane)</a>, a gripping account of the hunt for James Earl Ray, reminds us once again that a lot of Americans in the 1960s were living through a nightmare, not through a long, dreamy summer of love.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/harikunzru\" title=\"\"><strong>Hari Kunzru</strong></a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-382393652'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2011/11/25/1322242527858/Open-City.jpg' alt='Teju Cole, Open City' width='84' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>As ever a lot of my reading has been books that haven't been released this year – many titles in the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/\" title=\"\">New York Review Books classics series</a>, whose multicoloured spines now take up a good two feet of bookshelf in my apartment.

Penn shows us how an instinctive Machiavellian with a feeble claim to kingship transformed himself into a despot and founded a dynasty.

Oswald has excised the main Homeric narrative – Achilles, Patroclus, Agamemnon, Helen, Paris. True, Hector gets a mention, but only to say that he, too, died like the little people, the bit-players who bite the dust. Homer's brief lives: \"Euphorbus died / Leaving his silver hairclip on the battlefield.\" Oswald shares with Christopher Logue fearless anachronism – Oswald's Hector, \"Like a man rushing in leaving his motorbike running\" – but <em>Memorial</em>, though good, isn't a patch on Logue's Homer. A better editor would have dissuaded her from monotonously repeating her epic similes. Towards the end, there are 10 unrepeated similes. So the final, 11th simile, which closes the poem, is the more forceful for being repeated – like a closing, extended chord. And it is brilliant in its own right: a shooting star as a \"whip of stars\". <em>Memorial</em> has 15 or so perfect touches that show Oswald to be a considerable poet: for example \"flower-lit cliffs\", \"the darkness hit him with a dull clang\", the sea \"just lifted and flattened lifted and flattened\", \"fire with its loose hair flying rushes through a city\".</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kamilashamsie\" title=\"\"><strong>Kamila Shamsie</strong></a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-382393667'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2011/11/25/1322243558563/The-Cats-Table.jpg' alt='Michael Ondaatje, The Cat's Table' width='84' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It's impossible to explain through any discussion of plot and character the hypnotic brilliance of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780224093613/the-cats-table\" title=\"\">Michael Ondaatje's <strong>The Cat's Table</strong></a><strong> (</strong>Jonathan Cape). The joy of boyhood and the darkness at its edges are conveyed in scenes of extraordinary imagination – boys lashed to a deck in a storm, a dog biting down on the throat of a man, a girl skating across the deck of a ship in the early morning, a prisoner in chains walking its length at night.

Yiyun Li's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/sep/11/gold-boy-emerald-girl-yiyun-li\" title=\"\"><strong>Gold Boy, Emerald Girl</strong></a> (Fourth Estate) tells sad, graceful stories of love and savage loneliness, beginning with the haunting almost-novella-length \"Kindness\". The title story of Margaret Drabble's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jun/30/margaret-drabble-smiling-woman-review\" title=\"\"><strong>A Day in the Life of a Smiling Woman</strong></a> (Penguin Classic) is worth the cover price alone.

And from half a century ago comes Vasily Grossman's <strong>The Road</strong> (Quercus), whose title story can be read as a 4,000-word distillation of his epic novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780099506164/life-and-fate\" title=\"\"><strong>Life and Fate</strong></a> (Vintage), written the year following the confiscation of that novel's typescript by the Soviet authorities.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ahdafsoueif\" title=\"\"><strong>Ahdaf Soueif</strong></a></h2><p>I'm delighted to see Selma Dabbagh's book <a href=\"http://www.selmadabbagh.com/out_of_it_novel.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Out of It </strong></a>published (Bloomsbury). Driven, fast-paced, edgy, this is Dabbagh's first novel – although she's written excellent short stories.

One was Joan Didion's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/nov/11/blue-nights-joan-didion-review\" title=\"\"><strong>Blue Nights</strong></a> (Fourth Estate), which is even more raw and filled with loss than her previous memoir; the second is Francisco Goldman's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/aug/05/say-name-francisco-goldman-review\" title=\"\"><strong>Say Her Name</strong></a> (Grove Press), a masterpiece of storytelling and scene-setting; the third is Gjertrud Schnackenberg's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/oct/07/heavenly-questions-gjertrud-schnackenberg-poetry-review\" title=\"\"><strong>Heavenly Questions</strong></a> (Bloodaxe), poems with her customary eloquence and gravity now filled with shock and hurt, certainly the most beautiful work she has made. In the meantime, Jeffrey Eugenides and Alan&nbsp;Hollinghurst produced two supremely confident novels; their ambiguous versions of destiny and desire in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/oct/12/marriage-plot-jeffrey-eugenides-review\" title=\"\"><strong>The Marriage Plot</strong> </a>and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jun/17/strangers-child-alan-hollinghurst-review\" title=\"\"><strong>The Stranger's Child</strong></a> made me laugh at certain moments and sit up and shiver at others.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rosetremain\" title=\"\"><strong>Rose Tremain</strong></a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-382393670'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2011/7/11/1310384242763/Pure.jpg' alt='Andrew Miller, Pure' width='84' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Two historical novels achieve quiet distinction this year: Andrew Miller's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jun/24/pure-andrew-miller-review\" title=\"\"><strong>Pure</strong></a> (Sceptre) and Barry Unsworth's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/sep/16/quality-mercy-barry-unsworth-review\" title=\"\"><strong>The Quality of Mercy</strong></a> (Hutchinson). While Miller's prose is poetic and impressionistic, Unsworth's is formal and dense, yet both novels unfold highly dramatic stories in a measured and unfussy way. <em>Pure</em> gives to a young engineer, Jean-Baptiste Baratte, the gruesome task of digging up and carting away the mountains of the dead who lie in the Cemetery of Les Innocents in Paris in 1785, polluting its surrounding air and water. Over Baratte's terrible enterprise lies the shadow of the coming revolution, thus giving to Miller's vivid images of \"purification\" a fine historical ambiguity. Unsworth's novel, picking up the story of the 18th century slave-ship mutiny told in<strong> Sacred Hunger</strong>, has Erasmus Kemp, son of the disgraced ship owner, trying to bring the mutineers to trial in England, but finding himself thwarted not only by one slippery fugitive, but also by his own conscience, made suddenly manifest to him by his love for the reforming sister of a liberal lawyer. Both books are notable for their subtle meditations on kindness and compassion.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jeanettewinterson\" title=\"\"><strong>Jeanette Winterson</strong></a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-382393671'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2011/11/25/1322243338504/The-Bees.jpg' alt='Carol Ann Duffy, The Bees' width='84' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Carol Ann Duffy,<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/nov/04/bees-carol-ann-duffy-review\" title=\"\"><strong>The Bees</strong></a> (Picador).

The prime minister of Malawi is on the list, but South Africa's president Jacob Zuma is not. </p><p>France's president and prime minister both appear, as do the heads of state and of government of Poland, India and South Korea. But only Dmitry Medvedev, as president of the Russian federation, makes the grade; prime minister Vladimir Putin is conspicuous by his absence. </p></blockquote><p>Here is the full list the Cabinet

the University of East Anglia's <a href=\"http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/\">Climatic Research Unit</a> have once again been <a

The timing is similar to the \"climategate\" scandal of 2009, with emails published just before an important UN climate conference. Does this mean the science is in doubt? Quite the opposite, says Stephan Lewandowsky.</em></p><p>An ambulance pulls up behind you. You know it's an ambulance because you can read AMBULANCE in your rear view mirror. But you can also read it when you look at the vehicle directly; because the human visual system has the ability to quickly correct complete inversions or left-right reversals of letters. In fact, a complete inversion is easier to read than letters that are rotated only partially.</p><p>This human ability to process complete inversions more quickly than just partial distortions, alas, lends itself to exploitation by ruthless propagandists who seek to create a chimerical world in which up is down, left is right, and good is smeared as evil.</p><p>Nowhere is this more apparent than in the netherworld of attacks on climate scientists.</p><p>Remember <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100017393/climategate-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-of-anthropogenic-global-warming/\">\"climategate\"</a>? The illegal hack of personal emails released just before the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009 that some columnists pronounced to be the (approximately 132nd) \"final nail in the coffin\" of global warming?</p><p>Remember the \"errors\" in the IPCC's 2007 report? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2010/jul/02/ipcc-amazongate-george-monbiot\">\"Amazongate\"</a>, <a href=\"http://utsavmaden.com.np/blog/2010/05/20/himalaya-gate-the-himalayan-glacier-melt-fiasco/\">\"Himalayagate\"</a>, and so on?</p><p>What has happened to \"climategate\"?</p><p>What's happened is this.</p><p>First, the UK Parliament's Science and Technology Committee <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/15589450\">exonerated the scientist at the centre of the tempest</a>, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8511670.stm\">Professor Phil Jones</a>, finding he has \"no case to answer\" and that his reputation \"remains intact.\"</p><p>Then Lord Oxburgh (former chairman of Shell-UK) and his panel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/apr/14/oxburgh-uea-cleared-malpractice\">likewise exonerated the researchers</a>, finding their \"work has been carried out with integrity, and that allegations of deliberate misrepresentation\" are \"not valid.\"</p><p>Another enquiry, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jul/07/findings-muir-russell-review\">chaired by Sir Muir Russell</a>, found the scientists' \"rigour and honesty\" to be beyond doubt.</p><p>Two enquiries by his university also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jul/02/michael-mann-cleared\">cleared Professor Michael Mann</a> – who presented the first of now innumerable <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick_controversy\">\"hockey stick\" graphs</a> – of all allegations.</p><p>Ultimately the (conservative) UK Government concluded \"the information contained in the illegally-disclosed emails does not provide any evidence to discredit … anthropogenic climate change.\"</p><p>Not one, not two, but by now <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/11/22/374559/fool-me-once-shame-on-you-fool-me-twice-shame-on-the-media-more-stolen-emails-global-warming/\">nine vindications</a>.</p><p>This comes as no surprise to anyone with even a passing familiarity with the distinction between private chat and public actions.</p><p>And what has happened to the IPCC \"Whatevergates\"?</p><p>What's happened is this.</p><p>First, the Sunday Times apologised and <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/climate/sunday-times-retracts-critique-of-climate-sci/blog/12532/\">retracted its \"Amazongate\" story</a>. There is no \"Amazongate\"; there is only the Amazon rainforest threatened by climate change.</p><p>Then the <a href=\"http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/Climatechange/content/correction-wording-flood-risks\">Dutch government accepted responsibility</a> for erroneously informing the IPCC that 55% of the Netherlands are below sea level. In fact only 26% are at risk of flooding because they are below sea level, whereas the other 29% are, err, at risk of flooding from rivers.</p><p>And about a year after \"climategate\" broke, the <a href=\"http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/CRUstatements/rebuttalsandcorrections/johnhumphrys\">BBC finally apologised to the University of East Anglia</a> for its misleading coverage of the \"climategate\" pseudo-scandal.</p><p>All that's left of the \"Whatevergates\", therefore, is red-faced apologies and one indubitable IPCC error: the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/01/21/21climatewire-climate-science-panel-apologizes-for-himalay-25267.html\">incorrect projection of the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers to 2035</a>, as opposed to the more likely 2350. This error was drawn to the public's attention by, wait for it, an IPCC author.</p><p>Can we now forget about \"gate\" in connection with \"climate\"?</p><p>No.</p><p>Because there are too many real climategates that must not escape attention.</p><p>First, there was another batch of private emails posted by the <a href=\"http://cei.org/\">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a>, a \"think\" tank notorious even by American standards. <a href=\"http://cei.org/news-releases/climategate-reloaded\">Those emails</a> — yes, a second hack — revealed the real climategate by being truthful, with one scientist stating: \"Those who deny the biophysical facts of the world would deny … gravity\" and \"we're not in a gentlepersons' debate, we're in a street fight against … merciless enemies. Colleagues … are getting threatened with prosecution by … [US Senator James M.] Inhofe.\"</p><p>That is the second real climategate: the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/mar/01/inhofe-climate-mccarthyite\">McCarthyite attempts by Senator Inhofe to criminalise climate scientists</a> — attempts to criminalise those who, 35 years ago, predicted the temperature rise by century's end to within 1/10th of a degree.</p><p>This is no isolated incident: Virginia's Attorney General, Ken Cuccinelli, has launched several frivolous lawsuits — despite losing an earlier one — against the University of Virginia in what the Washington Post called a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/06/AR2010050605936.html\">\"war on the freedom of academic inquiry\"</a>\". And Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman evoked Pastor Niemoeller's cry against the erosion of humanity under the Nazis: <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/first-they-came-for-the-climate-scientists/\">\"First, they came for the climate scientists…\"</a>.</p><p>The real climategate involves active censorship within NASA by Bush appointees, which the agency's Inspector General later found to have <a href=\"http://oig.nasa.gov/investigations/OI_STI_Summary.pdf\">\"reduced, marginalized, or mischaracterized climate change science\"</a>.</p><p>The real climategate involves Bush White House staff replacing assessments of the National Academy of Sciences with a discredited paper by two individuals with no expertise in climatology. This paper, funded by the American Petroleum Institute, was so flawed its appearance in a peer-reviewed journal led to the resignation in protest by three editors and the publisher's unprecedented <a href=\"http://theconversation.edu.au/climate-change-denial-and-the-abuse-of-peer-review-1552\">acknowledgement of mishandling</a>.</p><p>Those are not merely historical episodes because the real climategate encompasses the ongoing complicity of some media organs.</p><p>In Canada, the real media climategate involves the ongoing list of defamatory articles by the \"National Post.\" The tabloid is <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2010/04/21/bc-andrew-weaver-national-post-lawsuit.html\">finally being sued</a> by Professor Andrew Weaver of the University of Victoria.</p><p>In Australia, the real media climategate involves the <a href=\"http://theconversation.edu.au/event-horizon-the-black-hole-in-the-australians-climate-change-coverage-2642\">national daily newspaper</a>, whose misrepresentations of science are legendary and, sadly ongoing.</p><p>Those real climategates are the tip of an iceberg of venality enveloping anti-science interests and their enablers.</p><p>And just a few hours ago, another illegal release of personal emails among scientists was dumped on to the world in the lead-up to the <a href=\"http://www.cop17-cmp7durban.com/\">next climate conference in Durban</a>. First Copenhagen, now Durban. When the science is so rock solid that it can no longer be reasonably doubted, all that is left is to steal private correspondence in a desperate attempt to disparage those who are trying to protect the world from the risks it is facing.</p><p>Joseph Welch famously <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_N._Welch\">brought down Joe McCarthy</a> with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO2iiovYq70\">simple question</a>: \"Have you no sense of decency?\"</p><p>This year has already <a href=\"http://theconversation.edu.au/from-kenya-to-texas-recent-climate-extremes-around-the-world-2824\">witnessed multiple events</a> that break climate records: the <a href=\"http://theconversation.edu.au/from-fear-to-famine-the-politics-of-hunger-in-the-horn-of-africa-2662\">drought in East Africa</a>, the <a href=\"http://agrilife.org/today/2011/08/17/texas-agricultural-drought-losses-reach-record-5-2-billion/\">worst drought in Texas' recorded history</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/28/storms-tornado-hit-us-south-alabama-tuscaloosa\">record breaking storms and floods in the US south</a>. Those events, anticipated by climatologists decades ago, should remind us that those who persecute and harass scientists, or mendaciously misrepresent their actions and findings, have no sense of decency.</p><p>That is the real climategate.</p><p>• This article was <a href=\"http://theconversation.edu.au/there-is-a-real-climategate-out-there-4428\">orginally published on The Conversation</a>.

Its people also stand to lose the most because they have the least resources to adapt.</em></p><p><em>Before the talks, John Vidal embarked on a journey between Africa's two most industrialised countries – South Africa and Egypt. The route included one of Africa's poorest nations (Malawi), its newest (Southern Sudan), its hungriest (Ethiopia), visiting some of its most remote tribes (in Uganda and Kenya), highest mountains (Uganda) and coastal areas (South Africa). All countries are experiencing climate change in different ways, and preparing and adapting at a different pace. But for all, the stakes are high, and the agreement is unanimous: climate change is real and it is happening.</em></p><p><em>This is the second in a series of articles recording that journey. </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2011/nov/18/egypt-climate-change\" title=\"\"><em>Read the first part, on Egypt, here.</em></a></p><p>A thousand miles south of Cairo, Sudan is having another rotten year. To the east, Somalia, much of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa are experiencing their third or fourth drought in a decade. This one is the deepest in 60 years and has led to millions of people becoming destitute, vast migrations and loss of animals. Sudan has this year been experiencing similar, but less dramatic conditions, with unpredictable rains, late harvests and severe crop losses. Nearly 4m people will need food aid, the harvest next year is expected to be well below average, and farmers are fleeing intense fighting between north and South Sudan troops in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan provinces.</p><p>None of this surprises Sumaya Zakieldeen, a researcher at Khartoum University's Institute of Environmental Studies who is on Sudan's delegation to the UN climate talks. <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/G02389.pdf\" title=\"\">She and her team have</a> studied five regions, comparing historical data going back 70 years and found drought and extreme flooding becoming more frequent, temperatures rising in winter, extreme – good and bad – years now more common and rainfall patterns changing. She says that if temperatures continue to rise, as is predicted over the next 50 years, the country can expect more desertification, and more tension between traditionally hostile groups.</p><p>Four years ago, UN Environment programme researchers based in Nairobi reported that the conflict in Darfur, which has caused more than 200,000 Sudanese deaths, was being driven by climate change and environmental degradation. With the Sahara desert advancing a mile or more a year in places, and rainfall down 30-40% over just a few decades, the UN study said shifts in climatic patterns threatened to trigger a succession of new wars across Africa.</p><p>Access to water is the difference between life and destitution, and climate change, it said, was creating \"unavoidable pressure on people through migration, displacement, food insecurity and impoverishment, possibly ending in conflict\".</p><p>The point was well made. The scale of climate change impacts recorded in northern Darfur is almost unprecedented: the reduction in rainfall has turned millions of hectares of already marginal semi-desert grazing land into desert. This has forced people to migrate and added significantly to the stress on the livelihoods of pastoral societies, forcing them to move south to find pasture.</p><p>But the UN interpretation of the undisputed data was <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=72985\" title=\"\">challenged as far too simplistic </a>by many academics and Sudan experts. They argued that an ecological interpretation of Sudan's civil war let the Sudanese government off the political hook. Instead, they traced the roots of the Darfur conflict to historical tensions between pastoralists and agriculturalists, the proliferation of arms and the absence of democracy.</p><p>The debate goes on, but the steady erosion of natural resources caused by a changing climate is now more or less established as one cause amongst many for the social strife and conflict.</p><p>Zakieldeen agrees that when climate change comes on top of other existing problems, and has the ability to trigger or at least exacerbate trends. \"Sudan is typical of other least developed countries in Africa in being highly vulnerable to climate change and climate variability. The interaction of multiple stresses – endemic poverty, ecosystem degradation, complex disasters and conflicts, and limited access to capital, markets, infrastructure and technology – have all weakened people's ability to adapt to changes in climate.\"</p><p>Five hundred miles further south in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, the Nile flows slowly past the burgeoning city, which is now experiencing a building boom. Oil provides 90% of the country's income, but water is the key to its  survival. Joseph Lual Acuil, the new minister for humanitarian affairs and disaster management recently warned that a food security crisis \"caused by the global climatic changes\" is looming.</p><p>\"Climatic changes have affected South Sudan in both floods and droughts. Rainfall that was supposed to have started early this year was delayed. This change in rainfall patterns has led to [the need for] repeated planting,\" he said.</p><p>Acuil is backed by Tipo Nyabeny, a young Sudanese community worker developing a climate adaptation programme with 15,000 people in Ayod county: \"The rainfall pattern has changed in South Sudan in the past few years and crops and livestock are threatened by this phenomenon. About 80% of the population here are cattle keepers who lead a pastoralist lifestyle, they travel long distances during dry season to the low lands in search of pasture and water. They say that poor harvests are the main challenge they face.\"</p><p>What happens to Sudan is expected to become more common across sub-Saharan Africa. According to the Africa Partnership Forum, nearly half of Africa will face water stress within 20-30 years. It says: \"Three-quarters of African countries are in zones where small reductions in rainfall could cause large declines in river water. Climate models show that 600,000 sq km classified as moderately water-constrained will experience severe water limitations. By 2020, [we expect] between 75m and 250m people to be exposed to an increase of water stress due to climate change.\"</p><p>This week, research sponsored by government-funded international science research group CGIAR concluded that higher temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns will bring further uncertainty and change to river basins in Africa, including the Nile. These changes could significantly alter water flows – presenting a new barrier to nascent efforts to better manage water for food production and to resolve potential cross-border water conflicts.</p><p>\"Climate change introduces a new element of uncertainty precisely when governments and donors are starting to have more open discussions about sharing water resources and to consider long-term investments in boosting food production,\" CGIAR said.</p><p>• John Vidal will be tweeting from the climate talks in Durban as <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/john_vidal\" title=\"\">@john_vidal</a>.

Never. Yet, like it or not, our worlds share many of the same societal challenges and there are a multitude of social entrepreneurs leading projects which could teach us a lesson or two.</p><p>One Kenya-based project provokes plenty of food for thought. The vision of David Kuria, IkoToilet is a professional outfit which builds toilet blocks in urban spaces across the country. For just 3p, an affordable price for all, the general public can go to an Ikotoilet and access clean, hygienic and safe facilities. Before IkoToilet <a href=\"http://www.acumenfund.org/investment/ecotact-limited.html\" title=\"\">this service simply didn't exist</a> and is now used by 30,000 people every day.</p><p>But here's the twist which make his social business a profitable venture. The Ikotoilet block is also known as a 'toilet mall'. The space surrounding the loo block is rented to local businesses and the wall space is sold for brand advertising. Income from entry fees, rent revenue and advertising deals covers all the overheads of each Ikotoilet and leaves enough left over to repay Kuria's investment loan. In fact, within five years each toilet mall will be turning a tidy profit which will be reinvested into the future growth of the organisation.</p><p>Let's also look to <a href=\"http://www.kickstart.org\" title=\"\">Kick Start</a> in Kenya. Founded by Nick Moon and Martin Fischer, Kick Start has helped 600,000 people out of poverty by selling tailored technology to smallholder farmers which allows them to transform the productivity of their land and sell their crops for a lot more cash. We're not suggesting that we solve the UK's unemployment issues by sending everyone into the countryside with a sparkling set of tools, but the principles behind Kick Start do have a lot to offer our thinking.</p><p>Before Kick Start, Nick and Martin spent years working for a major international NGO but grew tired of leading projects which drove no sustainable change and worse, nurtured a culture of dependency on handouts. They made a break with the conventional model so that instead of putting a plaster on a problem, they were driving real and lasting change. Sustainability can be a painful buzz word but this is an important question: is your social venture really driving change that's going to stick?</p><p>Kick Start is an organisation that also backs the merits of business. Their beneficiaries become serious business people who take their stake in the market economy. The organisation itself is commercially savvy and believes that welcoming competitors into their market is key to even greater success.</p><p>Moon admits that a lot of this business astuteness is thanks to him studying an MBA (certainly not everyone's cup of tea) and that the commercial world can teach us a lot. Business consultants might be a bore, but do you spend enough time burying your head in business thinking?</p><p>Finding a way to make your venture into a profitable social business might not always appear obvious or easy but Kick Start and Ikotoilet are great beacons for the opportunities that are out there. In the UK we don't look enough at more innovative ways of raising money . Nearly every charitable cause raises money through the same tiring channels without daring to do it differently. If you forced yourself to think about making money and not raising money, could you break this mould?</p><p>I'm sure, like the best of us, you endlessly compare your organisation to others but how often do you look overseas? These examples from Kenya are just two of the myriad of case studies across Africa which can lend thought provoking insights. So whether it's Africa or elsewhere, I challenge you to do this: open your eyes to a wider audience and look further afield for a fresh perspective.</p><p><em>Nikki and Rob Wilson are co-founders of </em><a href=\"http://www.ontheup.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>On the Up</em></a><em>, a social venture to profile Africa's most inspirational social entrepreneurs.

And it's not just the top end of the market that cares. B&amp;Bs, guesthouses and self-catering cottages across Britain market themselves on their low energy use – including whether they encourage guests to use public transport.</p><p>Earlier this year, we asked you to submit recommendations for sustainable travel experiences around the world. We received hundreds of nominations and, from those, our panel  of eco experts (see below) selected a shortlist they felt best demonstrate innovations in technology, ways of running a business, design and style. These range from places to stay to transport initiatives, festivals, and adventure and conservation holidays. All are pushing the boundaries of what green travel means.</p><p><hr /><strong>PLACES TO STAY</strong></p><h2><strong>Little White Alice, Cornwall</strong></h2><p>Little White Alice is a gorgeous collection of six new self-catering cottages in Carnmenellis, Cornwall. Most impressive is the chemical-free swimming pool, emerald green and surrounded by local granite, with a reed bed filtration system. Beyond lie 25 acres of the property's own land, left wild, for rambling and nature-spotting, helped by a barn owl house and bat loft. The houses are a mix of wood and stone, sleeping two to eight; some have wood-burners, private decks, wet rooms and bespoke willow work, and there's an art studio offering lessons. A wind turbine produces most of the cottages' electricity, ground source heat pumps provide underfloor heating, and solar panels hot water.<br />• <em>Cottages from £302 a week, 01209 861000, </em><a href=\"http://www.littlewhitealice.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>littlewhitealice.co.uk</em></a></p><h2><strong>Tregulland, Cornwall</strong></h2><p>At the edge of Bodmin Moor, Tregulland is a renovated self-catering pad, one of a new breed of eco-friendly upmarket properties. A stylishly converted stone barn and 15th-century cottage sleep 22 altogether – they can be rented separately – and are decked out with vintage furniture. The place is effectively off-grid for heating and water, thanks to a huge biomass boiler that keeps the indoor freshwater pool at a balmy 26C, as well as heating a steam room and outdoor hot tub. Its 16 acres of woodland stream and lake are great for spotting otters and migrating birds. If you can summon the energy to leave the sybaritic splendour, it's 15 minutes to the beach at Trebarwith Strand and a little further to Crackington Haven for cliff-top walks.<br />• <em>From £3,600 a week for 10, 01566 770880,</em> <a href=\"http://www.tregulland.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>tregulland.co.uk</em></a></p><h2><strong>The Green House, Dorset</strong></h2><p>The Green House is a refurbished seaside hotel in Bournemouth that claims to be \"the greenest hotel in the UK\". It's very stylish, with mauve-and-cream rooms, flatscreen TVs and Bose sound docks, yet its eco credentials are impressive. Solid wood furniture was  made using trees felled by storms or tree surgeons, rain water's harvested for irrigation, and the restaurant uses local, organic food, and only organic and biodynamic wines – there's a vegetarian tasting menu too (£45). Energy comes from solar panels and a combined heat and power unit.<br />• <em>Doubles from £140, B&amp;B, 01202 498900, </em><a href=\"http://www.thegreenhousehotel.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>thegreenhousehotel.co.uk</em></a></p><h2><strong>Fattoria San Martino, Tuscany, Italy</strong></h2><p>If this B&amp;B on an organic farm seems more stylish than the average agriturismo, there's good reason: owners Karin Lijftogt and Antonio Giorgini gave up jobs in the fashion industry in Milan to go into farming 20 years ago. They produce olives, saffron, wheat (for their own organic pasta) and honey. Having restored the 18th-century farmhouse using natural and organic materials, the couple now run it as a four-room guesthouse. Meals are organic, locally sourced and vegetarian; heating and hot water are solar-powered; and guests can relax by the property's natural pool.<br />• <em>Doubles from €130 a night B&amp;B, +39 0578 717463,</em> <a href=\"http://www.fattoriasanmartino.it/home/index.en.php\" title=\"\"><em>fattoriasanmartino.it</em></a></p><p><hr /><strong>SUSTAINABLE HOLIDAYS</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-381507442'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/11/4/1320421789515/Meskito-huts-along-the-Ri-007.jpg' alt='Meskito huts along the Rio Plátano river' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Meskito huts along the Rio Plátano river.

It's home to jaguars, monkeys, manatees and more than 300 bird species. Six indigenous communities host travellers in palm-thatched eco-lodges. They will transport you by dugout canoes through the rainforest as you tick off each adventure. Profits from the enterprise go direct to the villages.<br />•<em> From $425pp for a seven-day \"overland adventure\", including full board accommodation and activities but not international flights or transfers. +504 8976 3004, </em><a href=\"http://www.larutamoskitia.com\" title=\"\"><em>larutamoskitia.com</em></a></p><h2><strong>Nature Travels, Sweden</strong></h2><p>Kayaking around the Koster Islands, ski touring on the Jämtland Triangle, and timber rafting down the Klarälven river are among the adventure holidays available with Nature Travels, a UK tour operator of small-scale, low-impact trips. It is operated in Sweden using local guides and services. Packages don't include flights; customers are encouraged to take alternative transport from the UK, such as the ferry from Harwich to Esbjerg, Denmark, or the train via Germany. More than 90% of its clients travel within Sweden by public transport.<br />•<em>Five days' self-guided ski touring on the Jämtland Triangle costs from £286 per person including four nights' self-catering accommodation and maps but not transport or equipment (01929 503080,</em> <a href=\"http://www.naturetravels.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>naturetravels.co.uk</em></a><em> )</em></p><h2><strong>Sicilian Experience, Italy</strong></h2><p>Renovated stone cottages in the laid-back seaside village of Sant'Ambrogio near the Madonie national park are available to rent through a community tourism initiative that has breathed new life into this corner of Sicily. The scheme encourages locals, especially the young, to take pride in their heritage and promote local traditions. Organic gardening is flourishing and you can expect to find local olive oil, preserved vegetables and organic jams in your apartment.<br />• <em>A week in an apartment for two with terrace and sea views costs from €300. </em>+<em>39 0921 999011, </em><a href=\"http://www.sicilianexperience.com\" title=\"\"><em>sicilianexperience.com</em></a> <em>(a green flower icon marks accommodation that is part of this initiative)</em></p><h2><strong>Traidcraft Meet the People Tours, worldwide</strong></h2><p>Witness spectacular sunsets over the Himalayas, then explore the ancient city of Kathmandu, take an elephant safari in Chitwan national park then chill out in the lakeside city of Pokhara. This is just one of the whistle-stop itineraries on Traidcraft's novel sightseeing trips to developing countries. Other destinations include Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Cuba, Peru and Vietnam. While exploring the country, you stay with the small-scale farmers who make fairtrade products.<br />• <em>From £1,325pp for a 13-day tour of Nepal, including accommodation, most meals, transport and activities but not international travel. 0191 2651110,</em> <a href=\"http://www.traidcraft-tours.com\" title=\"\"><em>traidcraft-tours.com</em></a></p><h2><strong>Village Ways, India and Ethiopia</strong></h2><p>If you've dreamed of walking in the Himalayas but have been put off by the idea of strenuous high-altitude trekking, a Village Ways trip could be for you. Beginning at <a href=\"https://www.kmvn.gov.in/bins.php\" title=\"\">Binsar</a>, a wildlife sanctuary in the Himalayan foothills, you take gentle, guided walks from village to village, staying in guesthouses and eating home-grown vegetarian food. Village ways offers walking holidays in five locations in India and two in Ethiopia; a project in Kenya is under way for next year.<br />•<em> A nine-night trip to the Binsar region costs from £610pp, including transport, full board and guiding, but not international travel. 01223 750049, </em><a href=\"http://www.villageways.com\" title=\"\"><em>villageways.com</em></a></p><p><hr /><strong>TRANSPORT</strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-381507443'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2011/11/4/1320422001066/B-bug-Brecon-Beacons-006.jpg' alt='B-bug, Brecon Beacons' width='380' height='228' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>B-bug, Brecon Beacons</strong></h2><p>After winning the Green Dragon's Den competition at Hay Festival in 2010, the owners of the b-bug spent 2011 testing their innovative electric buggy – with the help of tourists. It's designed to be a quieter, low-carbon means of travelling around the Brecon Beacons national park. The cute open-sided b-bugs have a fabric roof, a top speed of 30mph and a range of 20 to 25 miles. They're charged using electricity generated by local micro-hydro schemes and use only 3kWh for every 20 miles, which the owners say equates to only three miles in a standard car.<br />• <em>B-bugs will be available to rent from spring 2012, prices and locations tba. 01874 665401, </em><a href=\"http://www.b-bug.com\" title=\"\"><em>b-bug.com</em></a></p><h2><strong>Accrington Eco Station, Lancashire</strong></h2><p>The first truly \"green\" railway station building on the UK network opened in Accrington in December 2010.

Margaret Thatcher had won a landslide victory at the polls and returned triumphant to Downing Street for a third term.</p><p>It was the year the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through 2,000 points for the first time (it is now over 11,000), while the UK music charts bopped along to the sounds of Whitney Houston, Duran Duran and Samantha Fox.</p><p>1987 was a different and less crowded world. On 11 July, the UN named Matej Mitja Gašpar, born in Zagreb, Croatia, the 5 billionth human being alive on the planet. To make sense of the milestone, the Guardian invited the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1663317_1663323_1669905,00.html\" title=\"\">Norman Myers</a>, the celebrated British environmentalist, to make sense of the moment in our global family's history. In the 24 years since his words below were published an extra 2 billion souls have been added to the planet. Myers speculated about returning the global average fertility rate to replacement levels – around two children per couple – by 2000 and keeping the planet's population peak to 8 billion – something he acknowledged would be a \"mammoth task\".</p><p>Nearly a quarter of a century hence it is clear we have failed to get close. Global population will add at least another 2 billion before dropping back. But the issues he raises for humanity to tackle - agricultural capacity, resource scarcity and the \"greenhouse effect\" – have only become more pressing. As Myers puts it: \"We shall need to do an enormous lot of things right, and all at once.\"</p><h2>World without end? Amen – by Norman Myers, 4 Jul 1987</h2><p>On 11 July, the United Nations has determined that the human population will reach 5 billion people. The UN won't designate the hour of that momentous day, nor the gender of the infant.</p><p>But while the arrival of the baby in question will be a cause for celebration for the parents, it is a matter for commiseration for the rest of us. Every day there is more evidence that the planet is groaning under its efforts to support its present burden of humankind.</p><p>The problem is not the intrinsic capacity of the Earth to support 5 billion. There are sound calculations to the effect that it could eventually support four times as many, perhaps many more still as we harness technology to make the deserts bloom, and all that. But this depends on our doing things right, and not just in expanding our agriculture. Twice as many people are expected to need three times as much fibre as well as food, and four times as much energy. In fact, we shall need to do an enormous lot of things right, and all at once. Yet we show a continuing capacity for doing things less than perfectly.</p><p>The essential problem is that the Earth is taking on board additional people at a rate that far exceeds the capacity of societies to plan for them. Even the most advanced and well organised community would find it taxing in the extreme to accommodate more people at a rate of 2% per rear for decade after overloading decade.</p><p>Britain never had to attempt it. When we were a developing country in the last century, we had to handle a population growth rate that rarely approached 1% and when things got a bit tight economically, we simply despatched the surplus to our dominions and colonies overseas. When the Americans had a growth rate of more than 1%, they could indulge the cry of \"Go west\". Today the developing countries average growth rate of around 2.5% a year, and for the most part they have run out of wests to expand into.</p><p>It is the exponential impact of population growth that causes trouble.</p><p>Not everybody appreciates the in-built dynamics of \"demographic momentum\": a growth rate of 3% sustained for 100 years produces an ultimate population that is 19 times greater than the initial size.</p><p>Thus the main population explosion – or to give it its proper name, the population implosion – is still to come. It has taken 13 years for us to climb from four to 5 billion. The next one billion will take us only 12 years, and to reach 7 billion 10 more years. Only then will there be a slow-down, until we reach a projected final total of over 10 billion more than a century hence.</p><p>Yet despite many efforts at birth control campaigns, the annual growth rate is still increasing a little. China's reproductive-age population is bulging as a result of the post-Great Leap Forward baby boom of the 1960s, plus a relaxation of its \"one couple, one child\" strategy. Well might the Chinese slacken off a little, even though the long-term consequences will be dire, according to the country's leaders.</p><p>The one-child goal clashes with the desire of Chinese with the desire of Chinese parents to have a son – a preference they share with human communities in most places at most stages of history. Result: when the first born turns out to be female, it sometimes ends up in the local stream – a penalty of the delay by China's earlier leaders to get to grips with population growth soon enough and vigorously enough. This might give pause to Bangladesh, Pakistan, and other countries, many of them Muslim, which let parents decide to do as best they see it at the time.</p><p>Some observers assert that rather than seeking to contain the number of people at the banquet of life, we should enlarge the table and place more food upon it. They might consider the prospect of Kenya, with 20 million people today. Kenya's population features a \"youthful profile\", meaning there are many prospective parents coming up through the ranks. Even were Kenya to come down to a two-child family forthwith (instead of eight), it would still reach 53 million people before growth peters out. Yet even were it to institute high-tech agriculture of the sort practised by the Dutch and Japanese, Kenya could not support more than 51 million people off its limited land.</p><p>The projected total for Kenya's zero-growth population is 111 million.</p><p>The July 11 infant is likely to be born to developing world parents.</p><p>But suppose it were to be an American baby? If it follows the prodigal habits of its parents, it would waste more energy in its lifetime than 20 Kenyans would carefully consume. If it were a British baby, its demand for peanut products and cotton would stimulate the growing of export crops in the Sahel, which tends to drive landless peasants into arid lands where they foster the spread of desert.</p><p>Each time we (well, you) climb on to our weekend yacht, we might speculate that much of the high quality timber has come from tropical forests. The price paid for the timber does not reflect all costs that go into its production in those forests especially over-cutting and other environmental damages. Our fossil fuel binge is the main source of the \"greenhouse effect\" that promises to disrupt climates for communities throughout the world. All too unwittingly but effectively and increasingly, developed world citizens contribute to the rundown of the planet's natural resources that sustain everyone's welfare. It is the super-rich 1 billion that do as much damage to our Only One Earth as the super-poor 1 billion.</p><p>Yet there is good news too. There are splendid opportunities to reduce birth rates with massive advantages. If the global community were to achieve a replacement level of fertility – namely a two-children family on average – by the year 2005, or 21 years earlier than the United Nations assumes in its medium projection to be a realistic target, the ultimate global population would stabilise at around 8 billion persons, or more than 2 billion fewer than the projection.</p><p>If replacement levels of fertility were not reached until 20 years later than anticipated, 2.8 billion people will be added to the projected global total. The difference of 4.8 billion is almost as many people as there are on Earth right now.</p><p>To reduce the fertility rate to replacement level by the year 2000 would be a mammoth task. But it would be by no means impossible, as witness the startling declines on the part of certain communities in Taiwan, South Korea, Java, Thailand, Kerala State in India, Sri Lanka, Cuba, Mexico, Costa Rica and Colombia, during the recent past – these being countries that represent a broad range of political and economic systems, as well as of social and cultural backgrounds. If Nigeria, for instance, were to achieve that goal, its ultimate population size would not be 532 millions but 227 millions – with a host of expanded options for the nation's sustainable development. The Indian sub-continent's total, now projected to reach 2.4 billion, would be reduced to 1.8 billion.</p><p>To reduce the fertility rate, most couples have to be provided with motivation as well as \"contraceptive hardware\" which is why the overall task is daunting. But we could make a solid dent in the problem by merely taking care of the needs of women who want fewer or no more children, but who lack family planning facilities. According to various surveys, the proportion of women with such unmet needs ranges in different countries from 11% to 29%. Suppose we accept a rough average, for the sake of a working approximation, of 20% of the 400 million women \"at risk\" in developing countries, or 80 million in all: even this relatively small number would be enough to reduce the ultimate population by many hundreds of millions.</p><p>To supply contraceptive services to these women would add, at an average cost of $12 per head, only another $1bn  or so on top of the present annual family planning expenditures (China excepted) of about $1 billion. That sum is equivalent to one third of one day's military spending worldwide. Which would buy us the more all-round security?</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2010/8/16/1281963181928/Food-and-overpopulation---002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/31/world-at-5-billion","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/31/world-at-5-billion","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"World population by country: UN guesses the shape of the world by 2100","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/may/06/world-population-country-un","fields":{"body":"<p>By the end of this year the world's seven billionth citizen will be born.

thirds of African children are effectively locked out of secondary school, according to a new UN report which cites secondary education as one of the next great development challenges facing many of the world's poorest countries.</p><p>A sharp increase in the number of students attending and completing primary school is placing intense pressure on developing country governments to meet the growing demand for secondary education, according to the <a href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Pages/ged-2011.aspx\">Global Education Digest 2011</a> (PDF), published by Unesco's Institute for Statistics on Tuesday. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the situation is most acute, the report warns there are only enough places for 36% of secondary school age children.</p><p>\"There can be no escape from poverty without a vast expansion of secondary education,\" said Unesco's director-general Irina Bokova. \"This is a minimum entitlement for equipping youth with the knowledge and skills they need to secure decent livelihoods in today's globalized world.\"</p><p>Globally, there were 531 million secondary students in 2009, compared to 196 million in 1970. Much of this growth took place in large and populous countries that started with relatively low levels of secondary education. The number of secondary students in China, for example, doubled from 52 million in 1991 to 100 million in 2009.</p><p>In sub-Saharan Africa, meanwhile, enrolment in secondary education grew ninefold, from 4.3 million in 1970 to 39 million in 2009. Nigeria accounts for the largest absolute increase, with the number of secondary students jumping from just 400,000 in 1970 to over 6 million in 2007. Secondary schools also expanded at rapid rates in many other African countries: in 2009, Ethiopia's 3.9 million secondary students eclipsed the 135,000 enrolled in 1971.</p><p>Despite this growth, sub-Saharan Africa still has the world's lowest level of participation in secondary school. And while the global gender gap for education has shrunk over the past decade, girls are still the first to suffer from the shortage of secondary school places in sub-Saharan Africa. The gender gap seems to widen with increasing levels of education: while there are 70 girls for every 100 boys who complete primary school in Kenya, for example, that ratio drops to 48 girls for every 100 boys for lower secondary, and just 37 girls for every 100 boys for upper secondary.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-382268306'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/25/1319535642400/Picture_64.png' alt='The global gender gap in education' width='457' height='301' class='gu-image'/><figcaption><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/interactive/2011/oct/25/gendered-world-education-gap-interactive\">Interactive: Explore how the global gender gap in education has changed over time </a></figcaption></figure><p>In order to measure and track the growing demand for secondary education, Unesco's statisticians have developed a new indicator, the \"effective transition rate\", which estimates the likelihood of a student moving to a higher level of education. While some of the world's lowest transition rates are found in sub-Saharan Africa, the situation varies dramatically between countries: 98% of students transition to secondary school in the Seychelles, but only 44% in Nigeria and just 36% in Tanzania.</p><p>Low transition rates reflect \"bottlenecks\" in countries' education systems, says the report, and may include the increased costs families associate with secondary school, from tuition fees and school uniforms to time away from employment and household chores. Secondary school can also cost more than primary as teachers may have higher academic qualifications and may need special training for subject-specific classes. In countries such as Malawi, Madagascar, and Niger, a secondary teacher earns two to four times more than a primary teacher, notes the report.</p><p>As aid flows have focused more on primary education, households in sub-Saharan Africa have been largely left to pick up the tab for secondary school, contributing over 40% of total spending. In contrast, families in North America and western Europe cover just 7% of their countries' spending on secondary education.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=developing%20post-primary%20education%20in%20sub-saharan%20africa%3A%20assessing%20the%20financial%20%20sustainability%20of%20alternative%20pathways&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsiteresources.worldbank.org%2FEDUCATION%2FResources%2F278200-1099079877269%2F547664-1099079967208%2FDeveloping_post-primary_edu_africa.pdf&amp;ei=uIylTsaeK4KLhQfz-pTwBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFohVQK0AePXiBgcAtk5BzhyOzt_g&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">2010 World Bank study</a> argued that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/oct/25/free-secondary-education-uganda-mixed-results\" title=\"\">the development of post-primary education in Africa</a> would require substantial amounts of external aid to plug current funding gaps. But as Rebecca Winthrop, director of the Brookings Institution's Centre for Universal Education, has warned, even <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2011/0824_bilateral_aid.aspx\" title=\"\">aid for primary education may be at risk</a>. This is because some donors are reducing overall aid spends, while others are abandoning education as a priority sector altogether.</p><p>We've pulled out some of the key data from Tuesday's report, which uses figures from 1970-2009 to chart progress on education at all levels and to track the quality and resources available for teaching and learning.

estimated that around <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Humanitarian%20Requirements%20for%20the%20Horn%20of%20Africa%20Drought%20%28reduced%20file%20size%29.pdf\" title=\"\">$2.5bn in aid is needed</a> for the humanitarian response to the ongoing crisis in the Horn of Africa. </p><p>As of 24 October, the funding shortfall stands at $627m, up from $592m on 17 October. </p><p>The increase is partly a result of revised requirements for work in Somalia, which rose from $985m to over $1bn. </p><p>Previously, the shortfall stood at $692m on 26 September, $917m on 19 September, $950m on 5 September, $1bn on 30 August, $1.1bn on 22 August, $1.22bn on 15 August, $1.33bn on 8 August and around $1.4bn on 1 August 2011.</p><p>At <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/jul/25/somalia-famine-starvation-warning\" title=\"\">an emergency meeting</a> of aid donors and charities at the UN Food and Agriculture Office (FAO) in Rome in July, the NGO Save the Children said that more than 1 million children could die in Somalia alone if the funding gap isn't immediately addressed.</p><p>If the humanitarian response is not quickly and comprehensively scaled up and if access to those most affected is not secured, the UN expects famine to spread across all regions of southern Somalia.</p><p>But there are no final figures here – not for the number of people who might be affected or for the amount of funding required or delivered. And tracking aid for the Horn of Africa crisis is not straightforward. There is no unifying funding appeal for the crisis; instead, there are three existing inter-agency appeals: the Djibouti Drought Appeal 2011, the Kenya Emergency Humanitarian Response Plan 2011+ and the Consolidated Appeal for Somalia 2011.</p><p>Ethiopia, however, poses a particular challenge – it is a crisis without an appeal. Unlike the other three countries, there is no published inter-agency appeal for Ethiopia, so it is not possible to track drought-related humanitarian needs and funding for Ethiopia in the same way.</p><p>Here, we've pulled data from <a href=\"http://fts.unocha.org/\" title=\"\">OCHA's Financial Tracking Service</a> on who is funding the humanitarian response, how much they've given and where the money is being spent. The data is compiled by OCHA on the basis of reports from donors and appealing organisations.</p><p>For Ethiopia, we've pulled out the figures for humanitarian aid to Ethiopia in 2011, though note that not all of this is specifically drought-related.</p><p>For Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti, note that while inter-agency appeals do exist, some donors might fund projects or organisations that are not covered by the appeals. These donations will not appear under the appeals but can be found through <a href=\"http://fts.unocha.org/\" title=\"\">OCHA</a>.</p><p>We will be updating this post each week with the latest information on funding.</p><p>See the <a href=\"#data\">full spreadsheet</a> for more data on humanitarian needs and funding for each of the four countries. The full sheet also shows both commitments and as-yet unfulfilled pledges. </p><p>What can you do with the <a href=\"#data\">data</a>?</p><h2>Data summary</h2><table>\n      <caption>\n

hypocrisy'","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-22T23:08:57Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2011/oct/23/gm-crops-africa-biotechnology","fields":{"body":"<p>Europe's opposition to genetically modified crops is robbing the developing world of a chance to feed itself and could threaten food security, a leading African scientist warns.</p><p>Dr Felix M'mboyi of the Kenya-based African Biotechnology Stakeholders Forum has accused the European Union of indulging in \"hypocrisy and arrogance\" and called on development bodies within Europe to let African farmers make full use of GM crops to boost yields and feed a world population expected to reach 7&nbsp;billion by the end of the year.</p><p>M'mboyi's emotive language comes in the run-up to a major food conference in London supported by the biotechnology industry. It follows signs that some African governments are softening their opposition to crops that are genetically engineered.</p><p>Last year Kenya passed a Biosafety Act allowing commercial cultivation of GM crops, becoming the fourth African country to explicitly legalise GM crops</p><p>However, opponents of GM food said the technology had failed to live up to its promises. GM could actually reduce food security by narrowing the variety of crops grown while making farmers more dependent on multinational companies such as Monsanto and Dupont, they said.</p><p>M'mboyi, a former agricultural adviser to the Kenyan government, will make the keynote speech at the  <a href=\"http://www.cropworld-global.com/\" title=\"\">Crop World Global </a>conference at the end of this month. He said: \"The affluent west has the luxury of choice in the type of technology they use to grow food crops, yet their influence and sensitivities are denying many in the developing world access to such technologies which could lead to a more plentiful supply of food.</p><p>\"This kind of hypocrisy and arrogance comes with the luxury of a full stomach,\" he said.</p><p>Some GM crops have been tested on a small scale in Africa. But governments are reluctant to introduce them commercially because they fear export bans from EU markets. M'mboyi will tell the conference, organised by the British Crop Production Council, that GM should not be ruled out and should be part of the mix along with conventional and organic production.</p><p>GM crops are grown in 29 countries on 3.7bn acres of land. While the US is by far the largest producer, about 48% of the world's GM plants are grown in developing countries.</p><p>Last week 20 food and conservation groups in developing countries <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/oct/19/gm-crops-insecurity-superweeds-pesticides\" title=\"\">reported that genetic engineering had failed to increase the yield of any food crop</a> – but had increased the use of chemicals and growth of superweeds.</p><p>Mike Childs, head of climate for Friends of the Earth, said: \"He's plain wrong if he says the EU are dictating what Africa can and cannot do. There is a strong grassroots movement against GM in the developing world largely because, where GM crops have been introduced, they have overpromised and underperformed.</p><p>\"The solution to feeding Africa doesn't start with GM technology and certainly not with the GM crops that are being peddled by the big multinational companies like Monsanto.\"</p><p>Duncan Green, head of research at Oxfam, said GM crops were not the answer to ending hunger. Some would tie farmers into buying seeds and pesticides from western suppliers and would threaten the tradition of seed swapping practised by 80% of African farmers. \"When you talk to people in developing countries about how to increase yields, GM comes pretty low down the list,\" he said.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/10/21/1319233653267/Kenyan-farmer-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/23/gm-crops-africa-biotechnology","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/23/gm-crops-africa-biotechnology","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"India v England – as it happened | Andy Bull","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-20T16:53:31Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/2011/oct/20/india-england-live","fields":{"body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p>Andy will  be here from 9.30am.</p><p>In the meantime here's Mike Selvey's preview.</p><h2>Upbeat England look to Finn's pace to salvage series</h2><p>The England party line is still a positive one: the sides contesting this series in India are essentially the same as in the summer, and they are pretty evenly matched. There is a strong belief they can win the last three matches and take the series just as Jo-Wilfried Tonga and Novak Djokovic, at Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows respectively, came from two sets down to beat Roger Federer. But, asked one shrewd India journalist of Steven Finn on Wednesday, if the sides are that close, how come you have lost successive matches by 128 runs and eight wickets, to which there is no answer but a bit of bluster. England, said Finn, have nothing to lose. Well, up to point, Steven: how about match and series?</p><p>But Djokovic was match point down when he unleashed one of the most memorable return-of-serve winners. Such devilry in the face of adversity is an attitude that can transform things almost in an instant. England have been heavily beaten by a side playing better cricket in conditions they know well, and which is mentally a world away from the shambolic collection that made their damp way around England and Wales. Where Finn is certainly right is that if India are playing at a peak of confidence and ability and England have been below par (allowing for the fact that one might be contingent on the other) then an improvement by the visitors will see matches a whole lot closer.<br /><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/oct/19/india-england-third-odi-mohali\"><br />Continue reading here …</a></p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>Morning then everyone</strong> and welcome to the latest instalment of the ritual debunking of the idea that England are the best all-round team in the world. All the talk in the last two days has been about whether they will or won't stick with the same side that got panned in the first two matches. I'm told that right now the players are out in the middle in Mohali, and that the lack of consolatory pats on the bum being dished out in the huddle suggests that England are going to field the same XI.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>It's time for the toss: England have won it and decided to bat first</strong>. \"It's time to deliver now,\" says Captain Cook. \"We must play better.\" He confirms that the side is unchanged. \"It's down to the XI to turn it around. MS on the other hand says that he was going to bowl first anyway, because the ball is going to swing all day long regardless and he thinks that it's easier for the spinners to bowl first because they don't have to worry about the dew. He's so self-assured in comparison to Cook that it already feels as though England are stuffed. Here's a glimmer of hope though: of <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/ground/57991.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=start;template=results;type=aggregate;view=toss_results\">19 ODIs at this ground 14 have been won by the side batting first</a>.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>So England look like this:</strong> AN Cook, C Kieswetter, IJL Trott, KP Pietersen, RS Bopara, JM Bairstow, SR Patel, TT Bresnan, GP Swann, ST Finn, JW Dernbach.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>And India look like this:</strong> G Gambhir, AM Rahane, PA Patel, V Kohli, SK Raina, MS Dhoni, RA Jadeja, R Ashwin, R Vinay Kumar, U Yadav, P Kumar.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>Incredible line-up of early 2000s talent on the Sky sofa today</strong>, with Robert Croft joining Marcus Trescothick and Ian Ward.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>The last time I was there Mohali had what was undoubtedly one of the very worst press boxes on the circuit.</strong> That was for the India v Pakistan semi-final in the World Cup, and it was full to bursting. I was sat on the back row, trying to get a view through the throng of heads out to the pitch through a tiny concrete slit of a window that made it feel as though I was in a gun bunker overlooking a D Day beach. I spent the match standing up. Perhaps things have improved since then. No doubt Lord Selvey will be in touch at some point to let us know.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>First email of the day comes from Mark Knight: </strong> \"Can't help thinking that just as India arrived in England tired and under-prepared, and then proceeded to get thrashed, we are now returning the favour. I know it's a bit of an old chestnut, but something really does need to be done about the scheduling of the international calendar – the quality of the matches is suffering and that's bad for the game. I'm finding it hard to really care about this series.\" I'm going to get the Indian fans' response in on their behalf, Mark: would you feel the same way if England were winning? The truth is that the majority of bilateral one-day series are entirely underwhelming unless they're blessed with close finishes. And this one is no exception.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>Trescothick is talking an enormous amount of sense about how to bat in ODI cricket</strong>, in comparison to some of the wishy-washy stuff the current batsmen come out with. \"You've just got to look to score off of every ball, and then hit the boundaries only when you feel it is a low risk shot.\"</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>\"At least England had enough days to get acclimatised and play a few warm up games,\"</strong> says Anand, referring to the victories against Hyderabad. \"Much more than India did for an important Test series. Does this mean that all talk of adjusting, acclimatisation is just a load of bull?\" You say \"a load of bull\" like it's a bad thing, Anand. But anyway, no, England's preparation was as good for what is a reasonably low-key series as it was ever going to be. Which is probably proof to the professionalism of their management as much as anything else. The blame surely lies somewhere else.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>1st over: England 2-0 (Cook 2, Kieswetter 0)</strong> Praveen Kumar takes the first over, and his opening delivery swings from middle towards off. Cook blocks it out to the off side. His third ball is a little too far over towards leg and Cook eases it away square for two. A word from Mike Selvey, currently sitting in the \"front row of the bunker\": \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/oct/19/india-england-third-odi-mohali\">My stat about the matches in October/ November , to whit 8 of the 9 have been won by the side batting first is erroneous I am afraid</a>. Put it down to weariness. It is a 5-4 split in favour of batting first. More disconcerting is the fact that 7 of the 9 decisions at the toss have proved wrong. There does not appear to have been a lot of grass removed since yesterday so the ball may well go through nicely.\"</p><!-- Block 12 --><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTJrOS6h-Bg\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qTJrOS6h-Bg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p><strong>2nd over: England 5-0 (Cook 2, Kieswetter 3)</strong> And here's Vinay Kumar, the other half of this amusingly angry Indian opening partnership. Neither man bowls much above 80mph, but both of them have a swagger out of all proportion to their speed. It's an excellent first over from Vinay, his first three balls all landing on or just outside off stump and swinging away towards the slips. Kieswetter is, for now, refusing to play at them, but you just know that if Vinay can keep it there he will succumb before long. But Vinay can't keep it there. His fourth ball drifts over towards leg, and Kieswetter pats it away for three to long leg. Here's Arvind Ramanan, with a gem of a snippet of archive footage: \"The truth is that Indian cricket fan(atic)s have spewed a lot of venom on the internet about 'payback', 'revenge' etc after the last two victories. Am afraid the Indians might get too comfortable and lift their foot off the gas. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTJrOS6h-Bg\">Mohali is where Walsh did this to Manoj Prabhakar</a>. Watch out for what Finn does to Rahane/Patel. A bit of zing in the pitch + top-order collapse and then, who knows...\" Great clip Arvind. Smyth would be proud.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>2nd over: England 8-0 (Cook 3, Kieswetter 4)</strong> Kieswetter has come out of his crease to bat against Praveen, trying to play the ball before it has a chance to swing. He plays a horrid swipe at a wide down the leg side, and misses the ball altogether. He plays a similar shot to the next ball, and this one is a little fuller and a little straighter. It hits his pads in fron tof leg stump and India appeal. Umpire Bowden shakes his head.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>WICKET! Cook 3 lbw Vinay Kumar (England 8-1)</strong> Oh dear. It's starting, isn't it? A lovely little ball from Vinay, swinging the ball back in after landing it on middle stump. It beats the inside edge of the bat and hits Cook's pads in front of off. Out comes the appeal, up goes the finger, and off goes Cook. Amusingly, the BCCI have demanded that the host broadcaster do not show the Hawk-Eye replays, so Sky's commentators can tells us that Hawk-Eye says it was out, but we're not allowed to see for ourselves. That's astonishingly petty behaviour from the BCCI. What are they afraid of? That people will see that it works?</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>5th over: England 18-1 (Kieswetter 12, Trott 1)</strong> Trott slices a single behind point, and Kieswetter then decides to swing a pull down towards fine leg. For a moment it looks like the ball might carry all the way into the fielder's hands, but in the end it bounces just in front of him and crosses the rope for four. Later in the over Kieswetter prods forward in an uneasy defensive and edges the ball past his stumps for another unconvincing boundary. \"It is true that when Mohali was made an international venue, it had a bit of something in it for the bowlers and was a very un-Indian pitch\" recalls Anand Kumar. \"I think there was also an instance of Dion Nash scything through our top order on the 1st morning of a test match and Ind were bundled out for 70 odd. (76, i think). These instances led to making Mohali more Indian and I am afraid that Arvind Ramanan (my very good friend) is still living in those times.\" Dion Nash? Now there's a name to conjure with. Was Chris Cairns on at the other end? Let's dig up the scorecard and see...</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>6th over: England 18-1 (Kieswetter 12, Trott 1)</strong> This one was a maiden. Anyway:  this is brilliant. I mean brilliant if you're the kind of person who takes pleasure in digging up old scorecards showing great deeds by unsung cricketers of the 1990s. Which, as you're reading the OBO, you almost certainly are. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63848.html\">Here we go</a>: India 83 all out, Nash: 11-2-27-6 and Cairns 9-3-23-2. India followed up with 505-3d in the second innings mind. Still, Nash and Cairns were a very decent pair of opening bowlers for a time.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>7th over: England 20-1 (Kieswetter 14, Trott 2)</strong> Dhoni appeals for a catch behind off of Kieswetter, who stands at the crease melodramatically shaking his head, just to give an unsubtle hint to the umpire. Praveen is a little late joining in, and the umpire rightly decides it was not out. The ball slipped through the gate and clipped the top of the pad on the way. \"Come on, Andy - it's not Vinnay Kumar. It's Vinay Kumar,\" points out Raghuram Cadambi. \"And I'm absolutely delighted for him. He has worked hard and proven himself consistently at domestic level. Based on his performances in the last couple of games, maybe he has a future in international cricket after all.\" Ahhh... good point. Apologies. Truth is I'm trying to resist a really strong urge to call him Vinny - there's something about his angry attitude, looks, size and stature that reminds me of Joe Pesci - My Cousin Vinny.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>8th over: England 26-1 (Kieswetter 15, Trott 6)</strong> Top shot by Trott, who steps down the pitch and clobbers Vinay for four through long-off. The shot gives enormous gratification to Sir Iron Bottom. \"That's what you have to do! You can't just let these medium-pacers settle!\" he thunders. \"And that's what they are! Medium pacers!\"</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>9th over: England 33-1 (Kieswetter 21, Trott 6)</strong> Kieswetter larrups a straight drive back down the ground, and Praveen sticks out a hand to try and grasp it. He can't cling on though, and ends up shaking his hand in pain. Wow. Old Iron Bottom will like this one: Kieswetter launches a huge pull out over cow corner for a six that lands several rows back into the empty stand. \"Surely the BCCI hasn't got that powerful and self important they wont even let Broadcasters show Hawkeye!?\" scoffs James Himsworth. \"The Saints preserve us.\" So say Sky. Nothing should surprise us when it comes to the BCCI. As Anand says: \"I wonder how far the BCCI must go in order to take the top spot in \"what's the most embarrassing thing about India\". They seem to be giving Bollywood a very good fight.\"</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>10th over: England 40-1 (Kieswetter 27, Trott 7)</strong> England needed that six - their scoring in this powerplay has been pathetically sluggish. Bumble points out that the average score for the first ten overs on this ground is 62, almost double what England have so far. Kieswetter gives the tally a final boost by clobbering the final ball of the powerplay for another six. But that still means it is only seven off the over - because there were four dot balls. And as Trescothick was saying at the start of the match - that's four too many. \"Dion Nash bowled brilliantly at Lord's in one Test,\" recalls Lord Selvey. \"Jagging the ball up the slope. He signed for Middlesex although with no great success.I think he got a series of injuries.\" Yup, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63647.html\">that'd be this one, I guess</a>. He had a shocking fitness record.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>11th over: England 43-1 (Kieswetter 28, Trott 9)</strong> Dhoni really has resorted to medium pace now. He's brought Virat Kohli to  bowl his wibbly-wobbly dibbly-dobbly stuff as first change. India have done this in all three matches now. Let's see if England have been smart enough to figure out a plan as to how to play him. And the answer is: no. They haven't. His over costs just three singles.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>12th over: England 53-1 (Kieswetter 36, Trott 11)</strong> Yadav is on now, and Kieswetter takes three from his second ball, sneaking an extra run off an overthrow. A single puts him back on strike, and he knocks four more down to fine leg. \"I just don't think Sky are being inventive enough when it comes to the BCCI banning them from showing HawkEye predictions,\" says Paul Billington. \"Surely they're not banned from rendering their own interpretation of it using Windows Paint?\"</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>WICKET! Kieswetter 36 b Kohli (England 53-2)</strong> Kieswetter gets to a tidy 32, and then contrives to get himself out against India's most innocuous bowler. It was a poor delivery, full and wide,  and Kieswetter tried to steer it away square. But he got into a terrible tangle and chopped it into the stumps. That delivery was 68mph. KP is off and running immediately, with a glance to fine leg for four.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>14th over: England 65-2 (Trott 17, Pietersen 6)</strong> \"If there's one thing better than revisiting the scorecard antics of unsung cricketers of the '90s,\" begins Edmund King, [and to be honest I can't possibly imagine where he is going to go with this because, let's face it, there is nothing that I'm allowed to mention on the Guardian which the OBO audience would possibly think is better revisiting the scorecard antics of unsung cricketers of the '90s, but anyway...]  \"could it be watching them perform in cricket-themed indie rock music videos? Here's Wellington band <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJYOUyfx85Y\">The Phoenix Foundation's \"Bleaching Sun,\" featuring Dion Nash behind the microphone, a Richard Hadlee shrine, Lou Vincent on the boundary, and oodles of unconvincing cricket action shots. All a true fan of the undersung could want, surely.\"</a> How have I not seen this before?</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>15th over: England 76-2 (Trott 26, Pietersen 8)</strong> Kohli continues, with his 70mph floaters. Trott knocks away an awkward glance to the leg side, and the ball just beats the diving fielder to the rope for four. He steers another boundary behind point later in the over. That's 11 from the over. \"This now, must surely be the end of the Keiswetter Experiment,\" says James Himsworth, and I'm inclined to agree with him. As Tony Rawlinson says: \"At times like these it seems as if Matt Prior's aggressive running might come in handy in keeping down the number of dot balls. I'm still a bit confused as to why England refuse to use one of the top wicket-keepers around in ODIs, especially as it's a format that they struggle in.\"</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>16th over: England 83-2 (Trott 27, Pietersen 14)</strong> Ashwin is on now, for the first over of the powerplay. Just as a counter to that point, it's worth remembering that Prior's ODI record is dismal, and he did not better as an opener than Kieswetter did. Maybe England need to give up on the idea of getting the 'keeper to open, which they seem to have been obsessed with for years now, and just find the best opening batsman that they can. \"Even with those two sixes, England managed only 15 scoring shots in 1st 10 overs,\" reckons Siddhesh Parulekar - I haven't checked his sums, it was certainly a low number. \"Too many dot balls in India.\" That's true.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>17th over: England 91-2 (Trott 27, Pietersen 22)</strong> Praveen is back on now, and the good news for England fans is that Pietersen is purring. There's an air about him today that suggests he has had enough of being walloped. He creams a cover drive for four, and cracks a cut past point for another boundary two balls later. \"It seems to me that Gilchrist has ruined ODI cricket for England,\" says Dan Lucas. \"If we can include Bresnan, Swann and Broad in the lower-middle order, then couldn't we find room for a top keeper in the tail? This also frees up space for someone like Buttler to come in at the top of the order.\" England have dabbled with that idea once or twice, picking James Foster for the T20 and giving Chris Read the odd run out, but they've never stuck with it for long.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>18th over: England 97-2 (Trott 30, Pietersen 25)</strong> Pietersen sets off on one of those Red Bull singles of his, off the last ball of the over too. \"He was determined to keep the strike,\" says Paul Allott. Which seems a bit harsh given that everyone has been slating the batsmen for not taking enough singles in the innings so far.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>19th over: England 108-2 (Trott 31, Pietersen 35)</strong> Pietersen stands up and plays a cover drive to a ball that was at the top of its bounce. Nick Knight can't praise the shot enough. KP had whacked the first ball through mid-wicket for four as well, so that's eight from the first two deliveries of Praveen's over. \"Now, I possibly pay less attention to meangingless ODIs than the BCCI would like, but did I miss the moment when it became law that keepers in ODIs MUST OPEN THE BATTING?\" thunders Beil Withers of Tunbridge Wells, parroting a point I made two overs ago. \"I can understand it if you've got a Gilchrist or a Sangakkara, but England haven't. Wouldn't Prior's aggressive batting and experience marshalling of the tail make him a useful lower order finisher? Perhaps I should add that this has been Bothering Me for Some Time.\"</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>20th over: England 111-2 (Trott 32, Pietersen 37)</strong> Which other 'keepers have England used as openers in recent season then? GO! Jones, for one. Steve Davies, for another, Prior and Kieswetter, of course. Anyone else? Three singles off Ashwin's latest over.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>21st over: England 112-2 (Trott 32, Pietersen 38)</strong> Ravi Jadeja is on now, and all of a sudden Pietersen doesn't look quite so sure of himself. The tension builds through five dot balls, and then KP snaps and sprints off for a madcap single. Trott doesn't respond, he knows it's a fool's errand, and he should have been out by yards. But luckily for him the return throw from the field is woefully wide, and though Dhoni had time to take the ball and have a second shy at the stumps, he missed and Trott was able to amble home.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>22nd over: England 115-2 (Trott 33, Pietersen 40)</strong> \"Don't forget poor Phil Mustard,\" says Mike Jakeman. \"Who was brought in at the request of the nation's sub-editors, following the success of Graham Onions.\" Aha, of course, how could I forget the Colonel?</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>23rd over: England 120-2 (Trott 35, Pietersen 43)</strong> Five singles in this over from Jadeja. \"Re: Edmund's video in over 14,\" says Anand, \"Is it proper to call these cricketers unsung as they have featured in a song?\"</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>24th over: England 123-2 (Trott 37, Pietersen 44)</strong> Another overthrow from India, but there's obviously a lot of unease between these two batsmen in the middle when it comes to their running. Trott shovels two runs around to fine leg with an ungainly scoop shot, and then squeezes home by a six inches or so to complete another sharp single. \"In the early days, Rahul Dravid was thought to be unsuitable for ODIs,\" recalls Arvind Ramanan. \"He scored 1 run off 23 balls against Kenya [i think  it is still the slowest innings in an ODI ever] once and was dropped from the ODI team after being given around 30-40 chances. He went on to force his way back into the team and score 10000+ runs in ODIs and play in a WC final in 2003. So, why not Ian Bell, a similarly classy strokemaker, at no.3? Forget his dismal record in ODIs and just let him play.\" The Indians seem to be even bigger fans of Ian Bell than the British, judging the number of fans and pundits from over there who have been calling for his recall.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>25th over: England 135-2 (Trott 43, Pietersen 51)</strong> Trott reverse sweeps four to third man, a unlikely sort of shot. And then a single puts KP on strike. He squeezes four away through the off side and that brings up his fifty, from just 48 balls.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>26th over: England 138-2 (Trott 44, Pietersen 52)</strong> Ashwain and Jadeja are fairly racing through the overs here. A man hardly has time to type, let alone write. So I'm going to hand over to my mucker Rob Bagchi for the rest of this over: \"There's a great story in Swann's autobiography about the Colonel and his total lack of discretion and self-awareness. In the dressing room the day after Jesse Ryder cut himself breaking into a lavatory at 5.30am in the morning in New Zealand in 2008, the players are discussing it in front of Peter Moores and Mustard pipes up \"Really? He was fine when I left him at 5am\", completely oblivious to the fact that he'd just dropped himself in it and copped another fine.\"</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>27th over: England 149-2 (Trott 45, Pietersen 61)</strong> What a strange shot from Pietersen, unorthodox, but effective. He stands up and hauls Yadav's second ball ball from outside off stump and away through mid-wicket for four. The next delivery is much fuller, and he whips it away square for four more. Whisper it, but he's playing wonderfully well today.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>28th over: England 152-2 (Trott 47, Pietersen 63)</strong> \"R Ashwin to bowl his third over,\" says Bumble, his voice cracking slightly in anticipation of the pun to come, \"first one to Our Kevin.\" Someone stifles a chortle at the back of the box.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>29th over: England 153-2 (Trott 48, Pietersen 63)</strong> A wonderful ball from Yadav, moving away off the pitch just enough to slide by Pietersen's outside edge. He looks a good bowler, Yadav, though his four overs have cost 28 so far today.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>WICKET! Pietersen 66 lbw Jadeja (England 153-3) </strong> Pietersen is disgusted by this decision, but that's not going to change the fact that he's been dismissed by a slow-left-armer. Again. He took a huge stride down the pitch, and the ball hit him near the knee in from of middle stump. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-england-2011/content/player/26314.html\">Umpire Asnani</a>, who is standing in his first international match <em>in 12 years</em>, didn't stop to think twice, but put his finger straight up. It was good captaincy from Dhoni, who took Jadeja off when he gave up 11 in an over, and then brought him back on at the other end. It was the first ball of the over too. For what it's worth Hawk-Eye, which the BCCI is not allowing us to see, says it was out.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>31st over: England 161-3 (Trott 49, Bopara 6)</strong> Another good delivery from Yadav, beating the outside edge of Bopara's bat with some away-movement off the pitch. He plays and misses at the next one as well. Ravi has already edged a delivery past the slips for four, and is looking a little nervy outside off stump.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>32nd over: England 161-3 (Trott 50, Bopara 6)</strong> Trott brings up his fifty, but it has taken all of 71 balls. And on this pitch, that's pretty slow going. \"I know people have concerns about Trott's strike rate but the man is such an accumulator!\" says Richard Parker. \"It's so rare that he doesn't get runs, whatever the rate.\" That's true - he as a ODI average of over 51 now. And yet...</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>33rd over: England 167-3 (Trott 53, Bopara 8)</strong> The one thing Trott doesn't have which, for example, Mike Hussey does, is an ability to accelerate at the end of the innings. If he could develop that, then there would be no doubt about his place. Hussey so often seems to score at a run-a-ball or under for three-quarters of his innings, and then quadruples the rate in the final overs. Four singles from this over.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>34th over: England 172-3 (Trott 54, Bopara 11)</strong> These two have out on 18 together now, from 29 balls. England are deaccelerating. So while we enter the slow overs why not go and have a look at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/oct/20/archive-mr-fry-on-the-morals-of-county-cricket-1911\">this</a>. It's from the Guardian archives, and though I've no idea quite what it is, because James Dart has just sent me the link, the description in the URL does sound very entertaining: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/oct/20/archive-mr-fry-on-the-morals-of-county-cricket-1911\">http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/oct/20/archive-mr-fry-on-the-morals-of-county-cricket-1911</a>.</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>35th over: England 177-3 (Trott 56, Bopara 15)</strong> Yadav gets a yorker all wrong, and Ravi glances it for four to fine leg. \"I think the problem with even very good batsmen adjusting to different formats is that they somehow, do not trust their game and tend to follow the pack,\" says Anand. \"Michael Clarke, VVS and maybe Trott are good examples. When they play T20 or have to score quick runs in ODIs they tend to play in a way that is not natural to them and end up with potentially more missed hoicks than proper runs. In this regard, I think SRT has done pretty well in not changing his game but using his shots to score more runs. Whenever he plays ODIs, he seems to be anchoring an innings at a strike rate of 90.\" Yes, by Tendulkar is, in cricketing terms, a genius, able to turn his hand to anything. I was about to say something extremely pretentious about Picasso being able to turn his hand to pottery, painting and sculpture. But thankfully I thought better of it.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>36th over: England 180-3 (Trott 58, Bopara 16)</strong> So England are compelled to take the Powerplay, and they only manage to take three runs off it. There was a juicy ball, full and wide of off stump, which Bopara dinks out to cover. In the press box Sir Iron Bottom rehearses a huge yahoo over cover. \"I know what I would have done with that ball.\"</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>37th over: England 190-3 (Trott 63, Bopara 21)</strong> Vinay Kumar is back into the attack. Trott bunts his first ball to long-on for a single. Sir Iron Bottom points out that since KP got out, Trott's strike rate has dropped to 55. Presumably he's thinking that he needs to anchor the innings and make sure that another wicket doesn't fall on the heels of the first one, but the knock-on effect is that he's putting a lot of pressure on Ravi as well as choking up the run rate. As I said, this would be OK if he was able to accelerate in the final ten overs. Anyway, I can tell I'm beginning to get tedious by banging on about this. Bopara belts four through square leg, and then, glory be, Trott slices a top-edge to third man for four. That's ten off the over.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>38th over: England 195-3 (Trott 65, Bopara 24)</strong> England muster five singles from this over, the thierd of the Powerplay. \"Elsewhere,\" begins Gary Naylor, \"Have you had sight of Patrick Cummins yet? At 18 years of age, he was too quick for South Africa yesterday. He looks like Mitchell Johnson and is as fast, but his action is more Chris Tremlett, so repeats with seam and bounce aplenty. I feared Australia again for a moment - until I saw that Steve Smith was still getting a game and all was well.\" Heh heh. No, I haven't seen him yet, but I've been hearing great things from those who have.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>WICKET! Bopara 24 b Praveen (England 195-3)</strong> Bopara goes, losing his middle stump to the first ball of Praveen's over. It was a yorker that did it, a good one, swinging in. Samit Patel has been promoted up above Bairstow in the order. He's the new man, and for some reason, sadly unknown to us, he's had a volley of abuse from the Indian fielders - Kohli and Raina in particular - on his way to the middle. I'm not sure that Samit is the kind of man you want to sledge.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>40th over: England 207-4 (Trott 72, Patel 5)</strong> \"If we can't actually discuss sticking a fork in Ravi's \"illustrious\" international cricketing career just now,\" grumbles David Hindle. \"Can we at least discuss at what point we might be able to start thinking seriously about doing so?\" Ah. Can I sit this one out? I've a real soft spot for Ravi. But I can understand that there is a pretty damning case to be made. In the meantime, Trott has cracked a four off the final ball of Ashwin's final over, which means England have made 30 off their Powerplay.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>41st over: England 215-4 (Trott 73, Patel 12)</strong> A good shot from Samit, who, like Ravi, needs to prove he is capable of shaping a match by himself. He latches on to a short ball from Yadav and launches it through wide long-on for four.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>42nd over: England 220-4 (Trott 76, Patel 14)</strong> England take five singles off Jadeja's latest over.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>43rd over: England 230-4 (Trott 77, Patel 23)</strong> Dhoni brings Vinnay Kumar back on, and he spears his first ball down the leg side. Trott follows it, and swings wildly but doesn't connect. He catches the next delivery, pulling it down to mid-wicket, but it falls at the feet of the fielder. Patel looks an altogether more likely run-scorer at the minute, and he plays another sweet shot here, popping up on his toes and flicking four runs away square. He knocks the next down to long-on, where the fielder dives along the boundary and flicks the ball back into play. But his foot just grazed the line, so that's four more for Patel. A good thing too, because he basically gave up on running and got an absolute slating from Nick Knight for his lack of effort.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>44th over: England 236-4 (Trott 80, Patel 26)</strong> A string of singles, six of them, off Jadeja's eighth over.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>45th over: England 248-4 (Trott 85, Patel 33)</strong> Trott drops to one knee and crashes a four over the top of extra cover. The ball skimmed just over the top of the diving fielder. \"I think you'll find,\" says Kartikey Srivastava, \"that Samit got the abuse because he ate all the Samosas last night; thereby leaving none for the two young Indian dashers who arrived late.\" Heheh. Samit once gave an interview to our own David Hopps announcing that he was \"going to cut down on his mother's curries\" so he could get back in the England team. Then later that night Hoppsy ran into him again. In a Burger King in a motorway service station. Oh well. He's playing very well here. He flicks a full toss fine for four, and then steps over to leg and punches a drive to long-off for two more. He has 33 from 23 now.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>46th over: England 255-4 (Trott 89, Patel 36)</strong> \"I want it noted for the record that Trott's strike rate has moved from the low sixties into the eighties in the last ten overs,\" says Troy Basset, not unreasonably. He lofts another chip out towards mid-wicket here, and gets two more. England need 50 runs off these last five overs. But I'm not sure they've got the firepower to do it. And so it goes. They take seven off this over, and at different points both Samit and Trott were rolling their eyes and shaking their heads in irritation at their inability to take advantage of the bad balls by getting them to the boundary.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>47th over: England 264-4 (Trott 89, Patel 45)</strong> Vinnay Kumar is back. And he's making Samit Patel look like a bit of a clown. He gets bamboozled by a slower ball. This is a bit embarrassing. Samit swings and misses at the first three balls, in fact he gets nowhere near any of them. He makes amends with the fourth ball, which he smacks over long-on for six. Samit knocks two more out to mid-off, where he is almost caught by Umesh Yadav, and takes a single off the last ball. \"Please can Trott get out,\" pleads Graham Wynne, \"so we can see Bairstow do some wild slogging?\"</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>48th over: England 271-4 (Trott 93, Patel 48)</strong> Samit's six remains the solitary boundary England have scored so far in these last five overs. Praveen has bowled another good over here, following the batsmen over to the leg side by bowling at their feet when they back away to try and make room for themselves. Seven runs off the over. This is now Patel's highest score for England, and his best innings too.</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>49th over: England 283-4 (Trott 94, Patel 59)</strong> Patel's fifty is up off just 36 balls. It's been a very good little innings from him. \"Call me a purist,\" says James Himsworth. \"But I would rather see somebody build an innings and get there deserved hundred than see some one slog it around for a few balls and probably get caught on the boundary.\" You <em>purist</em>. I take your point, but what I don't want to see is someone build an innings and then miss out on their hundred because they are so desperate to slog for six the ball that they keep swinging and missing or scuffing it to the fielders. Which is what Trott is doing right now. The flip side of which is that England's total is short of what it should be. Not for a lack of trying from Samit. He whacks one four off the fifth ball, and muddles another off the sixth.</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>50th over: England 298-4 (Trott 98, Patel 70)</strong> Vinay Kumar will take the last over then. Six balls left, and Trott needs six for his century. He takes two from the first ball with a cut to deep cover. He knocks the next ball to the leg side for a single, and will have to wait at the non striker's end to see if he gets another chance to reach his hundred.  Patel may not give him the opportunity. He smears a square drive through cover for another four. Aha! A single puts Trott on strike, he flicks the fifth ball to short fine leg and gets a single. So, with one ball left, it looks like he will be stuck on 98. Patel ends the innings in style, smashing a six back over the bowler's head.</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>So, this promises to be a really entertaining second innings.</strong> India 299, which won't be easy, if only because there was a little help for the fast bowlers right through that first innings.</p><!-- Block 62 --><p><strong>The real revelation was Samit Patel</strong>, who responded to being promoted up the order by playing his first really significant innings for England. He made 70 off 43. As for Jon Trott, today's innings will only reaffirm the divide in opinion that already exists about his place in the team.</p><!-- Block 63 --><p><strong>Before I go LISTEN UP to Pete Kingsley:</strong> \"Like the Samit Patel of old, I'm hungry - for votes.  Specifically, my cricket club - in partnerships with a local rugby and football club - is in the running for a £6k grant, which is decided by a public vote.  We're in a deprived bit of South Edinburgh, and we've already done some great cricket outreach work in local state schools, and we could do loads more with this cash.  OBO readers - feed me!\" It sounds a noble cause, readers, and will cost you nothing. <a href=\"http://communityforce.rbs.co.uk/project/898\">vote here</a>.</p><!-- Block 64 --><p><strong>Right</strong>, I've had some suggestions for captions. But to be honest they were all a bit rubbish. Yes, that's rich coming from me, I know. So if anyone's got anything better send it to Rob Bagchi at <a href=\"mailto:rob.bagchi@guardian.co.uk\">rob.bagchi@guardian.co.uk</a>. He'll be doing the second innings, starting in 30 minutes or so. Cheerio.</p><!-- Block 65 --><p><strong>INTERMISSION</strong> Drinks and snacks are available in the lobby.</p><!-- Block 66 --><p><strong>Afternoon all:</strong> Having been sidetracked all morning in cataloguing the saga of France's Rugby World Cup campaign, it seems I've walked right into a heated debate over IJL Trott. Kristian Petterson's is the first email in the queue: \"I know you didn't start this, Rob… but it's up to you to stop it. Everyone who's castigating Trott needs to settle down. The man scored 98.  Today is not the day for questioning his position (and role) in the ODI team. Kieswetter, yes.  Bopara, yes.  Trott, behave.\" Like your use of the injunction \"behave\", Kristian and I'm in agreement with your sentiments. England's problems do not stem from Trott's rate of scoring and the weight of it is something England would be foolish to discard. If they are building for the World Cup in Australia, then a man who can anchor the innings and score at 80 runs per 100 balls is going to be vital. My only question is whether he would be better off opening and Cook batting at No6. </p><p>Richard Parker concurs: \"I'm not at all sure how today's innings will continue to divide opinion about Trott?  He anchored the innings right the way through, scored 98 runs and helped England to a very competitive target of 298.  What's not to like?! All right he was two runs short of a century, whoopeydoo.\"    </p><p>Moving on to the caption competition. Let me know who deserves the dubious pleasure of winning. Here are the options so far:</p><p>1) \"I'd ordered a pie. GIVE ME A PIE.\" (Paul Billington)</p><p>2) \"Oi Patel, that's my samosa!\" (Peter Withey and Charlie Osborne)</p><p>3) Chak attack (Nick Holmes)</p><p>4) Public enemy front man reveals passion for one day game  (Leighton Taylor)</p><p>5) A hungry fan rallies the troops after spotting Rob Key in the queue for pies. (Ian Copestake)</p><p>6) \"I told you hiding his pies, wouldn't help …\" Stephen Grundy</p><!-- Block 67 --><p><strong>1st over: India 6-0 (Patel 6, Rahane 0) chasing 299</strong> Play! Christopher Bush has another caption: \"Jimmy Krankie goes native\". Ha. Steve Finn, the Watford Express, begins bowling to Parthiv Patel and pitches it up with a hint of swerve first ball and induces a nick off the third ball, well-played with a hint of slice down to third man for two after a fine diving stop. England's fielding has been uncharacteristically erratic in India so far so that was a sign of intent. When Finn over pitches Patel punches him wide of mid-off for four with precision timing.</p><!-- Block 68 --><p><strong>2nd over: India 10-0 (Patel 8, Rahane 1) chasing 299</strong> Tim Bresnan gets the other new ball. \"I am confused,\" writes Andrew West. \"Kieswetter scored 36 from 38 after seeing Cook go in 10 balls.  Are we really expecting our openers to score half centuries in those circumstances, in our run of form?  Trott scored 98 from 116.  Some of that innings was the basis for Pieterson's score.  Even if it was entirely selfish - he got 98 from 116!  Bopara wasn't amazing but he scored 24 at 75%.  Why are we complaining?\" It's being so cheerful as keeps us going, Andrew. Bresnan oversteps on his second ball, giving India a free hit which Patel has a swish at, doesn't middle and takes two to wide cover. Bresnan's bowling a shorter length than Finn but Patel has his eye in and gets on his toes to deal with it comfortably.</p><!-- Block 69 --><p><strong>3rd over: India 13-0 (Patel 8, Rahane 4) chasing 299</strong> Rahane opens the face with a squre drive down to third man and saunters two runs. Finn gets a wee bit excited when Rahane plays late and around a straight one and pushes it to midwicket. Dangerous shot but he pulled it off. I've been advised by Matt Colton that the caption competition is in poor taste and we should desist. \"No need to encourage people to indulge their prejudices concerning weight on a forum for a national newspaper. Let's stick to the cricket. Seriously, its not called for here.\" I'm persuaded to scrap it from now on.</p><!-- Block 70 --><p><strong>4th over: India 23-0 (Patel 8, Rahane 13) chasing 299</strong> Rahane plays a lovely forcing back foot shot for four. He's looking very confident and his timing so far has been spot on, every time Bresnan bowls straight he backs himself to whip him through the leg-side. He finishes the over with another of his square drives, opening the face a la Nasser Hussain and letting the ball glide down to the point boundary.</p><!-- Block 71 --><p><strong>5th over: India 25-0 (Patel 9, Rahane 14) chasing 299</strong> These two lack the Sehwag fireworks but they play very sensibly, accumulating rapidly with glides and flicks. When Patel does throw his bat at a wide one, though, he tends to play so far away from his body that it is hit uppishly square on the off-side. There are enough hints of susceptibility, of the danger of getting himself out, to keep the bowlers interested.</p><!-- Block 72 --><p><strong>6th over: India 32-0 (Patel 16, Rahane 14) chasing 299</strong> Now Patel plays a gorgeous punch down the ground for four then shows his other comedy caper side by taking on Bresnan's bouncer, top edging it over the slips to third man where Finn makes a wonderful, diving, stop. Richie Benaud would have grimaced at the sight of a quick chucking himself around so recklessly on the rope. Bresnan has a huge lbw shout, thinking pad first but the umpire is having none of it and it would have missed off-pole anyway.</p><!-- Block 73 --><p><strong>7th over: India 37-0 (Patel 17, Rahane 18) chasing 299</strong> Here's Michael Gorman on the toned down caption competition: \"Surely the only possible caption is: 'I say. Jolly good shot, sir.'\" It's flipping noisy, Mohali. A marvellously raucous crowd is enjoying itself, though the way the sound rises and falls I fear there might be a Mexican wave going round. Rahane chucks his bat at an uppercut that Bresnan tries valiantly to stop hitting the rope at third man but just fails. This is a fine start from India.</p><!-- Block 74 --><p><strong>8th over: India 46-0 (Patel 20, Rahane 22) chasing 299</strong> James Himsworth asks if anyone else thinks we could do with a wicket? Any superstitions that bring wickets. I had a mate who would go to the toilet at football grounds and our team would score, another who was convinced that if he lit up a cigarette his team would score. I think Nick Hornby used to do that, too. Here's Jade Dernbach replacing Bresnan, drifting too much to leg in similar fashion to the man he replaced. It's a massive ground and Patel takes three with a rolled-wrist glance to square leg. Sami Al Hamdani suggests the caption: \"Chaka Demus and Pliers revival gains strength in India.\" Rahane plays a late, deliberate edge to the third man boundary for four. Not a good start from Dernbach, too erratic in line.</p><!-- Block 75 --><p><strong>9th over: India 50-0 (Patel 20, Rahane 26) chasing 299</strong> It's a road this pitch. Sod all for the bowler apart from carry-through and the batsmen's flexible wrists allow them to glide it to fine leg and third man if given any width. They can find fine leg with a whipped shot even if it's a middle and leg line, too. Finn, though, bowls one in the corridor and Rahane tries to belt it on the up and misses. The last ball is 92mph, Rahane gets up on his toes and clips it down to third man where it drops six feet short of a sliding Bresnan.</p><!-- Block 76 --><p><strong>10th over: India 57-0 (Patel 26, Rahane 27) chasing 299</strong> Dernbach bowls the 20th and 21st England wides of the series but then makes it difficult for Patel to hit him off the square with a short-of-a-length heavy ball approach and a slower one bowled with a splayed two-fingered grip. His radar goes again, though, and Patel slashes him in the air through gully for four, tries again next ball, it goes squarer and Bairstow dives to stop it. Jos Roberts writes: \"I used to be able to bring a wicket by going to the toilet.  Unfortunately I over-used my special power while I was at the second Test at Trent Bridge this summer when I got four wickets on day four (and a round of applause on returning to my seat after the last one), and it's not worked since.\" You exhausted your Mojo, Jos. Sad news.</p><!-- Block 77 --><p><strong>11th over: India 62-0 (Patel 28, Rahane 29) chasing 299</strong> Samit Patel comes on to bowl. England clocking how MS uses Kohli perhaps. \"I think it's fairly well accepted that the method is for you now to type 'well, it doesn't look like either of these two are going to throw away their wicket any time soon…' then sit back and watch the magic happen,\" writes Michael Hunt. Does copying and pasting have the same effect I wonder. Let's see. Thomas Oxley suggests \"This is Indiaaaaaaa!\" for the caption.</p><!-- Block 78 --><p><strong>12th over: India 66-0 (Patel 29, Rahane 33) chasing 299</strong> Afternoon to Gary Naylor, with a sense of perspective about the competition: \"Not one of these is offensive enough to be unpublishable and not one of these is funny enough to be published.\" And a chastisement in there, too. Bravo! Suitably chastened, I'll get on with Dernbach's over which isn't as wayward as the last one but has a Bertie Bassett quality, slower ball, outside off-stump bouncer, one that darts into the batsman from wide of the crease. Go round the wicket, suggests Bumble. And he's spot on. The seamers need to find another angle of attack or it will be tip and run in excelsis.</p><!-- Block 79 --><p><strong>13th over: India 69-0 (Patel 31, Rahane 34) chasing 299</strong> Sky keep making the disclaimer that the \"pictures are courtesy of the host broadcaster\" to explain the numerous shots of the Indian team watching on the balcony that come three times an over and also, of course, for the absence of certain replays.</p><!-- Block 80 --><p><strong>14th over: India 73-0 (Patel 35, Rahane 34) chasing 299</strong> It's the bestselling author Graeme Swann into the attack and Kieswetter appeals for a stumping after the first ball turns menacingly but Patel has his back-foot firmly planted and is not out. Richard Crabtree proposes: \"Sorry, this is probably toned way too far down, but how about 'Ouch! Law 20, anyone?'\" The lost ball allusion is probably not toned down enough. Tom Adam writes: \"Blimey, Rob, you've been criticised by Naylor for publishing something unfunny ... has he got a death wish or something?\" This is a very interesting over from Swann, the ball fizzing viciously, then when there's a run out opportunity Kieswetter demolishes the stumps with the batsman diving to make his ground with such vigour that one of the stumps belts Patel on the head.</p><!-- Block 81 --><p><strong>15th over: India 73-0 (Patel 36, Rahane 35) chasing 299</strong> \"Do you suppose Dernbach (12th over) has considered bowling fast and accurately instead?\" writes John Starbuck. Now where would be the fun in that? Patel races through his over, conceding a pair of singles. The lack of flight makes him difficult to hit when his line is as good as it has been so far.</p><!-- Block 82 --><p><strong>WICKET!! Patel lbw Bresnan 38</strong> It looked a marginal decision on where the ball pitched and height but Patel was caught above the knee-roll neither forward or back and the umpire takes five seconds and puts his finger up.</p><!-- Block 83 --><p><strong>16th over: India 73-1 (Gambhir 4, Rahane 37) chasing 299</strong> Straneg over from Bresnan, clipped square twice, takes a wicket with a peach that pitched outside leg but the umpire gave it, served up a pie to Gambhir who smacked him for four through point first ball then followed it up with a jaffa that was angled across and slid back in, Gambhir playing and (only just) missing.</p><!-- Block 84 --><p><strong>17th over: India 87-1 (Gambhir 7, Rahane 38) chasing 299</strong> Dernbach replaces Patel who was pivotal in slowing the scoring rate. Even though Swann is rated the best ODI bowler in the world and Patel had been difficult to hit, it does look an odd decision of Cook's to go for the quicks by rote for the powerplay. I know Bresnan took a wicket but they should have more confidence in the slower bowlers.</p><!-- Block 85 --><p><strong>18th over: India 101-1 (Gambhir 11, Rahane 47) chasing 299</strong> I owe Gray Naylor an apology. I misread his email, or rather only read the first bit of it. Sorry, Gary: \"My comment about the unfunny, but inoffensive captions, referred to mine own below, and not to the efforts of others – BCCI Chief Negotiator arrives at ICC meeting; Much work still required on Indian haka; Crowd catch disappears down throat; Harbhajan Singh rumoured to be using same facial creams as Shane Warne. Though, as a man who would balance Samit and Ravi on the scales, I found nothing offensive in anyone's contribution to the competition.\" I laughed at two of them, Gary. But I better not say which. Yorkshire civil war looms as Bairstow gives up four overthrows by shying at the stumps and Bresnan looks miffed. The last ball of the over, which had another wide, is steered by Rahane to third man for four.</p><!-- Block 86 --><p><strong>19th over: India 103-1 (Gambhir 12, Rahane 48) chasing 299</strong> After Dernbach took some tap, Cook summons up … Finn. \"Bresnan takes a wicket with a peach and then serves up a pie? Being a father of two young children this is starting to make me think of Each Peach Pear Plum,\" writes Bob Miller. Out goes Tom Thumb. I'm in a similar predicament to you, Bob. They're two and five and I must have read that book 6,000 times. Finn's line drifts on to the batsmen's pads only once in this over, earning snorts from Walter Allott. He gets away with it and is better when Rahane faces. Only two off that over.</p><!-- Block 87 --><p><strong>20th over: India 106-1 (Gambhir 13, Rahane 50) chasing 299</strong> Now here's Swann for the final PP over of this set of five. \"Strange to see Bresnan struggling here,\" writes Guy Hornsby. \"I know he's a fairly unreconstructed bowler (obviously, being a Yarkshire lad) and pitches here are a different beast to England, but you'd have thought his control would be tight here, and he bowls a heavy ball. But he's been all over the place here really. Eight plus an over isn't really what you want to see. Finn aside, our pace bowlers really have struggled out here. I'd add more but I'm too hungover.\" Rahane moves to 50 with one of his flicks but Swann's control and the circle do their job to restrict India to three.</p><!-- Block 88 --><p><strong>21st over: India 111-1 (Gambhir 16, Rahane 52) chasing 299</strong> Patel returns. Clare A Davis greets us one and all, Bob Cratchit non-festive style: \"Afternoon Rob, afternoon all. Just took a bit of time out to go to the butcher for tonight's mince (beneficiary of a bag of homegrown chili peppers so only one thing to cook), and resume the OBO to find a wicket gone. Shame I don't have any more shopping to do. Guess the rest of the wicket taking is the bowlers' responsibility now.\" We may have to send you out again, Clare. Easy milking from India's batsmen, dropping the ball at their toes or five yards from the bat and running to end the over on Nelson.</p><!-- Block 89 --><p><strong>22nd over: India 117-1 (Gambhir 17, Rahane 57) chasing 299</strong> Swann is bowling very well, getting turn and nice drift. His lbw appeal is turned down when Rahane plays forward. HawkEye would have given it out, hitting leg stump. This censorship of HawkEye is both outrageous and quite comic. It's Canute. (Yes I know he didn't do it hubristically but the BCCI is).</p><!-- Block 90 --><p><strong>23rd over: India 121-1 (Gambhir 20, Rahane 58) chasing 299</strong> Gambhir feathers an edge at ankle-height through to the keeper who can't get down to take it. Sir Tin Ar$e reckons Kieswetter should have caught it. The fielders are stationed too deep to keep it as tight as Patel's bowling warrants and the batsmen are manipulating the spaces to take easy singles even if the ball is headed towards an England player.</p><!-- Block 91 --><p><strong>24th over: India 127-1 (Gambhir 23, Rahane 61) chasing 299</strong> Gambhir gets his chipping wedge out to knock it over the top of the ring to take a single or two, has a swipe at one and gets away with it, taking another. They just keep the scoreboard ticking over. I feel like saying \"Awwwww\" for Tom Hopkins: \"On the children's books theme, I recall a Ladybird book called Downy Duckling that I required my dad to read so often that it literally fell apart. A few years ago I thought it might make a nice gift for a junior relative, but it turned out to have been out of print for more than 25 years. That was a fairly depressing thought.\"</p><!-- Block 92 --><p><strong>25th over: India 136-1 (Gambhir 30, Rahane 63) chasing 299</strong> \"I still cannot believe this about Hawkeye and that the broadcasters are allowing themselves to be bullied, the BCCI needs to have a severe look at itself,\" says James Himsworth. \"Either that or the broadcasters should just pull their coverage and then we will see how big and clever they are without TV revenue.\" Sadly, James, I doubt the Indian broadcasters give a toss that they can't show HawkEye or, perhaps more accurately, they don't consider it an important issue. And the overseas brocasting rights are peanuts compared to the home ones for internationals and the IPL so if Sky said it wouldn't cover it I think the BCCI would just laugh at them. Nine off the over, Gambhir smashing one over the top to the midwicket boundary for four. Otherwise it's all about Samit Patel being tucked into the gaps.</p><!-- Block 93 --><p><strong>26th over: India 145-1 (Gambhir 33, Rahane 69) chasing 299</strong> Charlie Osborne rides to Tom Hopkins rescue: \"Downy Duckling is out of print maybe, <a href=\"http://www.abebooks.co.uk/servlet/SearchResults?bt.x=0&amp;bt.y=0&amp;kn=downy+duckling&amp;sts=t\">but certainly easy to find</a>, and a steal costing the princely sum of 63p\" I'm not allowed on Abebooks any more, Charlie. The house is full and my bank account empty. India milk the spinner again, belting Swann over the top for four then piercing the filed, one a sublime cut from Gambhir for three.</p><!-- Block 94 --><p><strong>27th over: India 152-1 (Gambhir 35, Rahane 73) chasing 299</strong> Spin didn't work in that spell so Dernbach is called back. The game looks gone even if India are only halfway there. \"Hey Rob – no need to send me out into the sleet and (nearly snow) currently battering my little village in the NE of Scotters,\" writes Clare Davies. \"I am about to take some time out to ring my mother. This has worked before.\" If it does you can give her the OBOers love. Well, the England fans among them. The return of pace at least lowers the recent rate from nine to seven an over.</p><!-- Block 95 --><p><strong>28th over: India 162-1 (Gambhir 41, Rahane 76) chasing 299</strong> Swann screams at Patel when the ball is glanced down to him at short third man and they run two. He gives him an earful to try to get him motivated but in fairness to the big fella, it's not just him. England have looked sluggish and in the wrong positions, too deep, for much of the innings. It's lovely batting, relatively drama free, oozing control and stealing runs at will, turning ones into twos, twos into threes. No wonder Swann is livid. Neelanshu Sharma puts the opposite view over HawkEye: \"In all likelihood, there will be instances where each series will have a different set of rules (and provisions for technology!!). So there is no point arguing pros and cons of a system which is not even in use for this series..!! I'm waiting for someone to refer to DRS now.\" The point is that the broadcasters have HawkEye. The commentators use it to assess decisions but at the explicit request of the BCCI, we're not allowed to see something that has been part of the coverage for UK viewers for the past six years. The question is why? What are they afraid of if we see it?</p><!-- Block 96 --><p><strong>29th over: India 168-1 (Gambhir 43, Rahane 77) chasing 299</strong> Bresnan v Bairstow. Swann v Patel. That was Yorkie v Yorkie, Notts \"mi duck\" v Notts \"mi duck\". Now it's Hopkins v Hopkins as David H declares war: \"Could you inform my brother Tom that Downy Duckling belonged to me, not to him, so should he find a copy I'll be claiming possession of it. Dernbach continues and Gambhir uses his feet to keep up with the rate needed of six per over.</p><!-- Block 97 --><p><strong>30th over: India 173-1 (Gambhir 48, Rahane 79) chasing 299</strong> Ravi Bopara comes on, all bustle and scurry, bowls a wide second ball. England need three men behind squer on wither side of the wicket to stem the flow of runs as Gambhir opens the face \"time and time again\" in Alan Hansen's oft-used phrase. The crowd's gone quiet. It's too easy. \"Without wanting to sound like a broken record - or a 'drowned fish', as my girlfriend once unforgettably remarked when completely mixing her metaphors, writes Rob Lee-Davey. In the seven overs since the end of the powerplay, there have been just 11 dot balls. Compare that with England's innings (15 scoring shots in the first 10 overs), and I would venture that is the main difference between the two sides.\" It is Rob, and Bumble is making the same point right now.</p><!-- Block 98 --><p><strong>31st over: India 181-1 (Gambhir 55, Rahane 80) chasing 299</strong> Swann resumes and, without wishing to upset the BCCI or indeed Neelanshu Sharma, has an appeal turned down for leg-before as Gambhir gets down to sweep that the unmentionable device suggests was out, hitting leg stump. Gambhir then dances down the wicket very gracefully, whips his bat through with a Laraesque arc and absolutely creams Swann over long-off for six to bring up his 50 and the century partnership.</p><!-- Block 99 --><p><strong>32nd over: India 183-1 (Gambhir 56, Rahane 81) chasing 299</strong> A stat from Sky. At the end of the 31st over India had faced 22 dot balls fewer than England, roughly the difference between the scores at that point. Which it sort of would be. BGut it does show England pat too many balls back, or leave too many. Bopara comes round the wicket and hurtsKieswetter's hands with a sharpish one floated outside Rahane's off-stump. They walk a single to Captain Cook. Not for the first time, says Bumble, identifying a weak link in England's field and suggests India are targetting him because he's such a plodder (I'm paraphrasing, slightly).</p><!-- Block 100 --><p><strong>33rd over: India 188-1 (Gambhir 57, Rahane 84) chasing 299</strong> The cryu from the stumper is \"C'mon fellas\". But the batsmen push the ball into the gaps and treat Swann as if … well … as if he's not the NO1 ranked bowler in 50-over cricket.</p><!-- Block 101 --><p><strong>Drinks</strong></p><!-- Block 102 --><p><strong>WICKET!! Gambhir c Pietersen b Finn 58</strong> Has the door opened? Rather a rash shot from Gambhir a back-foot slash at a ball that was marginally back of a length and he he spooned it up into the covers where Pietersen got his feet moving quickly enough to get into position to leap and pluck it out of the air one-handed.</p><!-- Block 103 --><p><strong>34th over: India 192-2 (Kohli 1, Rahane 87) chasing 299</strong> I like Satyajit Ray Davies's nom de plume as well as his style, when he writes: \"The discussion so far assumes far too many things. The BCCI is not run by professionals, it is the last refuge of professional politicians. Their decisions and common sense aren't usually on speaking terms.\" Excellent over from Finn, removes Gambhir who was trying to pull him over midwicket and arced it to cover then targets Kohli, sticks in a slip and tries to get him unsure of whether to play forward or back in t'corridooooor.</p><!-- Block 104 --><p><strong>35th over: India 195-2 (Kohli 2, Rahane 89) chasing 299</strong> Samit Patel bowls one with sticky fingers that he can't release properly and serves up a long-hop that, remarkably, Kohli fails to score off. astounded probably. Lorraine Reese sent this: \"Although we're the best at Test cricket and T20 world champions, I'm coming to the conclusion that we're just not very good at one day cricket. Am I wrong?\" A meringue? No thanks. Then England take a wicket 30 seconds later and she claims credit: \"On the off chance that by emailing you I caused the wicket to fall I'm going to send another. Except, although I did actually have something to say, I've forgotten it now. Sorry.\" That's fine, Lorraine. Hang on a minute, though. Clare, who got Patel out, wants to add Gambhir's scalp: \"Hey Rob, just off the phone to Mum and see there is a wicket!  Who should I ring now?\" Mr Srinivasan, El Presidente, BCCI?</p><!-- Block 105 --><p><strong>36th over: India 195-2 (Kohli 2, Rahane 89) chasing 299</strong> India's batting powerplay begins and England put in a gully and slip for Kohli but he gets off strike with a leg-bye when Finn strays to leg. Rahane takes one and puts Kohli in, Finn reverting to aan off-stump line and then cleverly jags a heavy ball into his body so he can't clear the field. The run rate has crept up to 7.21.</p><!-- Block 106 --><p><strong>37th over: India 207-2 (Kohli 11, Rahane 91) chasing 299</strong> Dernbach gives Kohli the hurry-up with a bouncer, the batsman shapes to hook, mistimes it and the ball thunked off the toe of the bat, wrongfooting Kieswetter who dived backwards to his right and managed to pouch the ball in the web between thumb and forefinger. Sadly, when he hit the ground the ball bounced out of his glove. Dernbach gave a vociferous groan of despair, like one of those tin can toys that used to moo if you turned them upside down. Kohli then adds insult to injury with a sumptuous drive on the up for four and slack fielding allows him to take one. Not misfielding but slack as in the fielder being on his heels.</p><!-- Block 107 --><p><strong>WICKET!! Rahane c Cook b Finn 91</strong> Game on. Clare Davies must be on the phone. Rahane succumbs to imminent centuryitis, almost out the previous ball chasing a short ball, he then pops up a catch when he stops his off-drive mid followthrough when tricked by a slower ball and looped it up to Cook at cover who dived and caught it well.</p><!-- Block 108 --><p><strong>38th over: India 207-3 (Kohli 11, Raina 0) chasing 299</strong> Kohli, bang, four. Another fine shot. He looks a glorious player at times. Matt Emerson has a plan for another wicket: \"Could you get Clare to give my Mum a call? She's lovely and I do need to ring her, but I'm not sure I can face 30 minutes about her next door neighbour to be honest …\" Lorraine Reese also has one: \"Happy for Clare to take the credit For Gambhir's wicket as my second email appears to have had no effect. She better be on the phone right now.\" Finn decides to respond with a bouncer to Rahane and the batsman goes for the hook and gets off when the ball is just too high. Kohli tells him to calm down but he doesn't and is out next ball when Finn takes the pace off a good length ball.</p><!-- Block 109 --><p><strong>Wicket!! Raina c Pietersen b Bresnan 0</strong> This is getting interesting. Raina, who is justifiably cocky given his one-day form, tries to dominate Bresnan and smash him to show who's boss after Kohli whacked him for a pair opf boundaries earlier in the over. But the ball is too wide and short for the shot he chose, a forcing back foot cut cum drive, and he hits it straight to Kevin Pietersen in the covers.</p><!-- Block 110 --><p><strong>39th over: India 217-4 (Kohli 20, Dhoni 0) chasing 299</strong> \"There might be a market for toy cricketers who moo when turned upside down,\" writes John Starbuck. \"They should also bounce a bit to celebrate a wicket.\" I'd buy one, John. Bresnan comes on and is given a slip but Kohli gives him some tap. He changes things around, though, when Raina tries to demonstrate his contempt and pops it up to KP. All change.</p><!-- Block 111 --><p><strong>40th over: India 229-4 (Kohli 31, Dhoni 1) chasing 299</strong> Bresnan goes from hero to clutz with a clumsy attempt at a diving stop at short third man. He dives over the top, misses the ball completely and relieves the pressure when the ball races to the boundary. Dernbach moos anew and again when Kohli plays a wonderful shot for two off his toes to mid-on. The last ball is a legside full stop and it's smacked for four to square leg, receiving the beating it deserved.</p><!-- Block 112 --><p><strong>41st over: India 233-4 (Kohli 34, Dhoni 2) chasing 299</strong> End of the powerplay ushers Samit Patel back into the attack. It's the hope that hurts in the end, for James Himsworth as for so many of us: \"Now we could be entering a whole new world of pain.\" He's bowled intelligently in parts but when he strays outside off-stump he's been punished and he does it once every couple of overs. Here, Kohli drives him to deep point and runs three early in the over but he recovers well and keeps them well below the rate.</p><!-- Block 113 --><p><strong>WICKET!! Kohli lbw Swann 35</strong> Plum, you'd have to say, as Swann rips one and gets huge turn for the first time since his first over and clips Kohli on the pad when he was playing back, trying to nurdle it to square leg. The batsman gives hi pad a real hammering with his bat and yelps in frustration.</p><!-- Block 114 --><p><strong>42nd over: India 237-5 (Jadeja 0, Dhoni 2) chasing 299</strong> Matthew Valentine has a late but decent entry for the caption comp: \"Who ate all the Hawkeyes?\" very good. Right. Swann's back on. The sweepers are out and the batsmen respond by dropping the ball short of the ring and running at pace. But then Swann traps Kohli with a fizzer that had the batsman rocking back and missing. They've done well to keep the momentum going, England. Seized the initiative and have kept running with it. It's on a knife edge. I'd say India were favourites but one more wicket would stand it on its head.</p><!-- Block 115 --><p><strong>43rd over: India 243-5 (Jadeja 3, Dhoni 8) chasing 299</strong> Six off Patel's over, which isn't bad for this stage of the game but you sense Dhoni is biding his time.</p><!-- Block 116 --><p><strong>44th over: India 245-5 (Jadeja 4, Dhoni 9) chasing 299</strong> Sorry for the truncated nature of the last post. I lost the bulk of it when it refused to launch. Swann's in his last over and starts with three dots before Jadeja takes one to long-off and Dhoni follows him to long-on. He finishes with another dot in an excellent over. John Sims wants the credit for India's mini-collapse: \"It's me.  I'm in New Jersey trying to get conference calls done - every time I check back in, another wicket falls; I am the god of  wickets.  It was a bit depressing in the first innings, but I'm feeling better about my super power now.  By the way, if anyone wants to phone my Mum, she'd be delighted to hear from you - tell her the grandchildren in the US are all fine; that'll cheer her up.\"</p><!-- Block 117 --><p><strong>45th over: India 253-5 (Jadeja 9, Dhoni 12) chasing 299</strong> Samit Patel has been doing OK, concedes a single, Jadeja comes down the pitch and belts him for a straight four but Patel bowls a beauty, right in Dhoni's blockhole to shore things up. But the last ball Dhoni scarpers through for two when it should have been only a single.</p><!-- Block 118 --><p><strong>46th over: India 263-5 (Jadeja 13, Dhoni 14) chasing 299</strong> Dernbach comes on for his 14th spell, or that's what it feels like anyway. \"Oh, no Dhoni,\" writes Clare Davies. \"He could just cut loose, Rob, and wrap the series up for India in a few innings. Everyone has to do their stuff now for wickets and dot balls. We need, for cricket, this series to stay alive.\" I wish Dernbach would, delving into his bag of tricks he comes out with a leg-side slower ball that goes for four leg-byes. \"What's wrong with fast and straight?\" asks Sir ITB. And he's right. He then bowls another slow ball that Jadeja steers to the point boundary. Someone should tell him to stop this silly experimentation when the batsmen are clearly so used to the idea he bowls several a spell that he fools no one apart from himself. Ten from the over.</p><!-- Block 119 --><p><strong>47th over: India 269-5 (Jadeja 16, Dhoni 17) chasing 299</strong> 36 required off 24 balls. Bresnan will bowl the first six of them after a long delay while Captain Cook sets the field. Tip and run first two balls as England try to protect the rope and seem content to let them take a run a ball even if it's hit directly at the fielder. Bopara saves four with a diving stop at point and the first five balls go for singles and the last ball, a full toss, also only goes for one. Here's Robert Fry: \"I've had a sudden flashback reading through the OBO to a pub quiz last week where, after imbibing a little too much, the question was asked 'Who is the current England Ladies cricket captain?' In my booze addled funk, I replied with the only ladies name I could associate with the sport. 'Clare Davies' I demanded, and refused to back down. My team have yet to invite me to tonight's reprise.\" You mean, she isn't?</p><!-- Block 120 --><p><strong>48th over: India 282-5 (Jadeja 22, Dhoni 24) chasing 299</strong> In like Finn, who has been the pick of the bowlers, going for 31 off his first nine. Thirty needed off 18. A single comes off the first ball but Finn drops short next ball and Dhoni rocks back and pulls him for four. The captain spanks the third with a lovely off-drive but Swann saves four on the boundary edge and they run two. Finn responds well with a yorker but <em>aaaaagh!</em>, Jadeja gets a thick outside edge for four off the fifth and a single off the last to backward square leg. We'll go ball by ball now.</p><!-- Block 121 --><p><strong>48.1 over: India 284-5 (Jadeja 24, Dhoni 24) chasing 299</strong> It's Dernbach to bowl the penultimate over. \"Fast and straight,\" shouts Both. Slower ball, they take two though should have been run out but Kieswetter breaks the stumps with his feet with Jadeja miles short. He reprieves him by failing to rip the stump out of the ground and hitting it with a ball. Clutz x2.</p><!-- Block 122 --><p><strong>48.2 over: India 285-5 (Jadeja 25, Dhoni 24) chasing 299</strong> Short ball from Dernbach shovelled into the offside for a single</p><!-- Block 123 --><p><strong>48.3 over: India 286-5 (Jadeja 25, Dhoni 25) chasing 299</strong> Slow full toss, bottom edge to leg-slip position. They take one.</p><!-- Block 124 --><p><strong>48.4 over: India 287-5 (Jadeja 26, Dhoni 25) chasing 299</strong> Another slow full toss, knocked to long-on off the top half of the bat for one.</p><!-- Block 125 --><p><strong>48.4 over: India 288-5 (Jadeja 26, Dhoni 25) chasing 299</strong> A ruddy wide. Trying to be too clever by half</p><!-- Block 126 --><p><strong>48.4 over: India 290-5 (Jadeja 26, Dhoni 25) chasing 299</strong> Now he bowls a beamer, unintentionally one thinks as it may have slipped. No ball</p><!-- Block 127 --><p><strong>48.5 over: India 291-5 (Jadeja 26, Dhoni 26) chasing 299</strong> A single.</p><!-- Block 128 --><p><strong>48.6 over: India 291-5 (Jadeja 26, Dhoni 26) chasing 299</strong> A single shovelled into the legside.</p><!-- Block 129 --><p><strong>49.1 over: India 296-5 (Jadeja 26, Dhoni 30) chasing 299</strong> Slow ball smashed for four by Dhoni.</p><!-- Block 130 --><p><strong>49.2 over: India 300-5 (Jadeja 26, Dhoni 35) chasing 299</strong> Three to win off five balls and Dhoni finishes it with a wallop over extra cover for four.</p><!-- Block 131 --><p><strong>India win by five wickets</strong> When it came to the crunch, England bowled far too many slow balls, becoming predictable and hittable and gave away seven wides and two no balls. Dernbach needs some more advice about his variety and the need for less of it. Get a stock ball. Don't make the trick balls the stock ball. And Kieswetter's stepping on to the wicket was lamentable. Poor execution and poor thinking not to uproot a stump and still run him out. Samit Patel batted brilliantly and bowled pretty well, that was one consolation. A latterly enjoyable but frustrating match, on the whole. I think the captaincy in the field isn't really of the first rank either, the positioning of his fielders leaks runs and he should have a word with his bowlers about their line. Thanks for your emails. Goodbye.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/10/17/1318847293282/Englands-Kevin-Pietersen--003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/20/india-england-live","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2011/oct/20/india-england-live","sectionName":"Sport"},{"webTitle":"Mapping murder throughout the world","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-10T14:41:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/oct/10/world-murder-rate-unodc","fields":{"body":"<p>Comparing murder rates of countries can really highlight the countries with problems - the ones in seriously need attention. A high murder rate gives a \"tip off\" that something needs to change.   </p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org\">UNODC</a> have <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/global-study-on-homicide-2011.html\">collected together all the national data on homicide</a> for 207 countries. </p><p>But of course nothing is ever simple when bringing together national statistics. Countries have different definitions of murder and the data is collected at different times and using different methods. All of this makes comparison of murder rates a messy business. </p><p>But we can draw out important trends. We have taken a table of murder rates the UNODC have collected, and mapped them here:</p><p>We have the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2011/oct/10/unitednations-development-data\">full map</a> for you to explore more easily. You can also see the dates and source of the stats for each country in the <a href=\"#data\">table below</a> and when you click on a country in the map.</p><p>What does a high murder rate tell us about the country? The UNODC boldly state the cyclic relationship between crime and economic conditions: </p><blockquote><p>there is a clear link between violent crime and development: crime hampers poor human and economic development; this, in turn, fosters crime. Improvements to social and economic conditions go hand in hand with the reduction of violent crime.</p></blockquote><p>If this is the case then Honduras needs social and economic interventions fast, as does El Salvador and Cote d'Ivoire. </p><p>If we take some economic measures such as <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html\">gdp per capita</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html\">CIA factbook</a> we can see a general trend that those lower in the ranking are those with higher murder rates. </p><p>Section 2 of the UNODC report looks in more detail at these trends, relating murder rates to inequality in society and other economic indicators.   </p><p>Here is the UNODC murder rate data in a usable format for you to explore.

future of UK aid 2010-15 – get the data","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-05T07:45:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/datablog/2011/oct/05/datablog-future-plans-uk-aid","fields":{"body":"<p>In March, the British government revealed the results of its much-anticipated aid reviews, giving headline figures on how UK aid would concentrate on an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/feb/27/uk-aid-budget-andrew-mitchell\" title=\"\">increasingly small pool of developing countries</a>. But it didn't tell us how exactly money would be spent in those countries.</p><p>Seven months later, many in development circles remain puzzled. Will aid priorities be increasingly rolled into national security objectives? What are UK priorities in \"fragile states\"? What proportion of country-level budgets will be invested in women and girls? And what exactly does \"value for money\" mean?</p><p>Since March, the Department for International Development (DfID) has slowly released <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Media-Room/News-Stories/2011/Action-plans-set-out-future-of-UK-aid/\" title=\"\">operational plans</a> for the countries in which it will continue to work, complete with tables dividing budgets across the different sectors – from governance and security to education, health, water and sanitation.</p><p>We've extracted all the data from the country plans, which were published on DfID's website as Pdfs, and built an <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/global-development/interactive/2011/sep/27/aid\" title=\"\">interactive</a> exploring where and on what the UK will spend its aid budget over the next five years. It helps to show funding priorities and lets you compare across and within regions and countries. We built the interactive using the BubbleTree code from the <a href=\"http://okfn.org/\" title=\"\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.openspending.org/\" title=\"\">OpenSpending.org</a>, and will continue to update it as more information becomes available.</p><p>We've also looked at what trends have emerged. Note that plans for India, Malawi and Yemen are yet to be released. All figures here are based on the countries for which data is available.</p><p>Health and education remain among the top areas for UK aid. But when you look within health, for example, interesting trends become apparent. By 2015, reproductive, maternal and newborn health will consume nearly 64% of DfID's global health funding, while the share of funding for HIV and Aids will drop from 16% in 2010-11 to under 6% in 2014-15. In the Caribbean, which has the world's highest prevalence rate, the UK will not fund any further work on HIV and Aids, with the justification that this sector is \"well served by other donors\".</p><p>Though this data gives us a better sense of how UK aid will be spent over the next five years, at least three significant black holes remain. First, with the exception of Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania, few of the country plans include lists of specific projects and programmes that will be funded. For most countries we only have aggregate spends for sectors, which can be quite broad – such as \"poverty, hunger and vulnerability\". This makes it difficult to get a clear and detailed sense of DfID's priorities and to understand how it will practically evaluate its results.</p><p>Second, country plans for India, Yemen and Malawi have yet to be published. India is set to receive the third largest amount of UK aid over the next five years, a total of £1.12bn. UK aid to Yemen, regarded by Britain as a \"failed state\" and a fertile recruiting ground for al-Qaida, is set to almost double from £46.7m this year to £90m by 2014-15. And earlier this year, DfID said it would indefinitely <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/jul/14/britain-suspends-aid-to-malawi\" title=\"\">suspend part of its aid programme in Malawi</a> due to concerns about economic management and governance. Malawi was set to receive a total of £373m in UK aid by 2015.</p><p>And third, while both the top-line aid reviews and the more detailed country plans give us information on which countries and sectors will get more or less funding, neither give us enough information on who exactly will benefit from UK aid money. Without details on which companies get aid-funded contracts, for example, we won't fully understand how much of UK aid will actually reach developing countries' economies.</p><p>You can download the full data from each of DfID's published country-level budgets <a href=\"#data\">here</a>.

Currently, obtaining energy from neighbouring Arab countries costs Jordan about a fifth of its gross domestic product.</p><p>The country is also one of the world's most water-poor nations. Jordan plans to desalinate sea water from the Gulf of Aqaba to the south, then pump it to population centres in Amman, Irbid, and Zarqa, using its nuclear-derived energy.</p><p>After the Fukushima disaster, Jordan started re-evaluating safety procedures for its nuclear reactor, scheduled to begin construction in 2013. The country also considered more safety procedures for construction and in ongoing geological and environmental investigations.</p><p>\"The government would not reverse its decision to build nuclear reactors in Jordan because of the Fukushima disaster,\" says Abdel-Halim Wreikat, vice Chairman of the JAEC. \"Our plant type is a third-generation pressurised water reactor, and it is safer than the Fukushima boiling water reactor.\"</p><p>Wreikat argues that \"the nuclear option for Jordan at the moment is better than renewable energy options such as solar and wind, as they are still of high cost.\"</p><p>But some Jordanian researchers disagree. \"The cost of electricity generated from solar plants comes down each year by about five per cent, while the cost of producing electricity from nuclear power is rising year after year,\" says Ahmed Al-Salaymeh, director of the Energy Centre at the University of Jordan. He called for more economic feasibility studies of the nuclear option.</p><p>And Ahmad Al-Malabeh, a professor in the Earth and Environmental Sciences department of Hashemite University, adds: \"Jordan is rich not only in solar and wind resources, but also in oil shale rock, from which we can extract oil that can cover Jordan's energy needs in the coming years, starting between 2016 and 2017 ... this could give us more time to have more economically feasible renewable energy.\"</p><p>Finance, rather than Fukushima, may delay South Africa's nuclear plans, which were approved just five days after the Japanese disaster.</p><p>South Africa remains resolute in its plans to build six new nuclear reactors by 2030.</p><p>Katse Maphoto, the director of Nuclear Safety, Liabilities and Emergency Management at the Department of Energy, says that the government conducted a safety review of its two nuclear reactors in Cape Town, following the Fukushima event.</p><p>But the government adopted its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) for 2010-2030 five days after the Fukushima accident. Elliot Mulane, communications manager for the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation, (NECSA) a public company established under the 1999 Nuclear Energy Act that promotes nuclear research, said the timing of the decision indicated \"the confidence that the government has in nuclear technologies\".</p><p>And Dipuo Peters, energy minister, reiterated the commitment in her budget announcement earlier this year (26 May), saying: \"We are still convinced that nuclear power is a necessary part of our strategy that seeks to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through a diversified portfolio, comprising some fossil-based, renewable and energy efficiency technologies\".</p><p>James Larkin, director of the Radiation and Health Physics Unit at the University of the Witwatersrand, believes South Africa is likely to go for the relatively cheap, South Korean generation three reactor.</p><p>Larkin says nuclear energy is the only alternative to coal for generating adequate electricity.</p><p>\"What other alternative do we have? Renewables are barely going to do anything,\" he said.</p><p>He argues that nuclear is capable of supplying 85 per cent of the base load, or constantly needed, power supply, while solar energy can only produce between 17 and 25 per cent.</p><p>But, despite government confidence, Larkin says that a shortage of money may delay the country's nuclear plans.</p><p>\"The government has said yes but hasn't said how it will pay for it. This is going to end up delaying by 15 years any plans to build a nuclear station.\"<br /><strong>Planned Ninh Thuan nuclear plant</strong></p><p>Vietnam hopes its first nuclear plant, Ninh Thuan, will be completed by 2020</p><p>Vietnam's nuclear energy targets remain ambitious despite scientists' warning of a tsunami risk.</p><p>Vietnam's plan to power 10 per cent of its electricity grid with nuclear energy within 20 years is the most ambitious nuclear energy plan in South-East Asia. The country's first nuclear plant, Ninh Thuan, is to be built with support from a state-owned Russian energy company and completed by 2020.</p><p>Le Huy Minh, director of the Earthquake and Tsunami Warning Centre at Vietnam's Institute of Geophysics, has warned that Vietnam's coast would be affected by tsunamis in the adjacent South China Sea.</p><p>The Ninh Thuan nuclear plant would sit 80 to 100 kilometres from a fault line on the Vietnamese coast, potentially exposing it to tsunamis, according to state media.</p><p>But Vuong Huu Tan, president of the state-owned Vietnam Atomic Energy Commission, told state media in March, however, that lessons from the Fukushima accident will help Vietnam develop safe technologies.</p><p>And John Morris, an Australia-based energy consultant who has worked as a geologist in Vietnam, says the seismic risk for nuclear power plants in the country would not be \"a major issue\" as long as the plants were built properly. Japan's nuclear plants are \"a lot more earthquake prone\" than Vietnam's would be, he adds.</p><p>Vietnam is unlikely to experience much in the way of anti-nuclear protests, unlike neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines, where civil society groups have had more influence, says Kevin Punzalan, an energy expert at De La Salle University in the Philippines.</p><p>Warnings from the Vietnamese scientific community may force the country's ruling communist party to choose alternative locations for nuclear reactors, or to modify reactor designs, but probably will not cause extreme shifts in the one-party state's nuclear energy strategy, Punzalan tells SciDev.Net.<br /><strong>President Benigno Aquino III</strong></p><p>President Benigno Aquino III said the mothballed Bataan nuclear reactor will never be used for its original purpose.</p><p>Will the Philippines' plans to rehabilitate a never-used nuclear power plant survive the Fukushima accident?</p><p>The Philippines is under a 25-year moratorium on the use of nuclear energy which expires in 2022. The government says it remains open to harnessing nuclear energy as a long-term solution to growing electricity demand, and its Department of Science and Technology has been making public pronouncements in favour of pursuing nuclear energy since the Fukushima accident.</p><p>Privately, however, DOST officials acknowledge that the accident has put back their job of winning the public over to nuclear by four or five years.</p><p>In the meantime, the government is trying to build capacity. The country lacks, for example, the technical expertise. Carmencita Bariso, assistant director of the Department of Energy's planning bureau, says that, despite the Fukushima accident, her organisation has continued with a study on the viability, safety and social acceptability of nuclear energy.</p><p>Bariso says the study would include a proposal for \"a way forward\" for the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, the first nuclear reactor in South East Asia at the time of its completion in 1985. The $2.3-billion Westinghouse light water reactor, about 60 miles north of the capital, Manila, was never used, though it has the potential to generate 621 megawatts of power.</p><p>President Benigno Aquino III, whose mother, President Corazon Aquino, halted work on the facility in 1986 because of corruption and safety issues, has said it will never be used as a nuclear reactor but could be privatised and redeveloped as a conventional power plant.</p><p>But Mark Cojuangco, former lawmaker, authored a bill in 2008 seeking to start commercial nuclear operations at the Bataan reactor. His bill was not passed before Congress adjourned last year and he acknowledges that the Fukushima accident has made his struggle more difficult.</p><p>\"To go nuclear is still the right thing to do,\" he says. \"But this requires a societal decision. We are going to spark public debates with a vengeance as soon as the reports from Fukushima are out.\"</p><p>Amended bills seeking both to restart the reactor, and to close the issue by allowing either conversion or permanent closure, are pending in both the House and the Senate.</p><p>Greenpeace, which campaigns against nuclear power, believes the Fukushima accident has dimmed the chances of commissioning the Bataan plant because of \"increased awareness of what radioactivity can do to a place\". Many parts of the country are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters, which critics say makes it unsuitable both for the siting of nuclear power stations and the disposal of radioactive waste.<br /><strong>Boy in Kenyan slum</strong></p><p>The demand for electricity is overwhelming in Kenya</p><p>In Kenya, nuclear proponents argue for a geothermal – nuclear mix</p><p>In the same month as the Fukushima accident, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency approved Kenya's application for its first nuclear power station (31 March), a 35,000 megawatt facility to be built at a cost of Sh950 billion (US$9.8 billion) on a 200-acre plot on the Athi Plains, about 50km from Nairobi.</p><p>The plant, with construction driven by Kenya's Nuclear Electricity Project Committee, should be commissioned in 2022. The government claims it could satisfy all of Kenya's energy needs until 2040.</p><p>The demand for electricity is overwhelming in Kenya. Less than half of residents in the capital, Nairobi, have grid electricity, while the rural rate is two per cent.</p><p>James Rege, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Energy, Communication and Information, takes a broader view than the official government line, saying that geothermal energy, from the Rift Valley project is the most promising option. It has a high production cost but remains the country's \"best hope\". Nuclear should be included as \"backup\".</p><p>\"We are viewing nuclear energy as an alternative source of power. The cost of fossil fuel keeps escalating and ordinary Kenyans can't afford it,\" Rege tells SciDev.Net.</p><p>Hydropower is limited by rivers running dry, he says. And switching the country's arable land to biofuel production would threaten food supplies.</p><p>David Otwoma, secretary to the Energy Ministry's Nuclear Electricity Development Project, agrees that Kenya will not be able to industrialise without diversifying its energy mix to include more geothermal, nuclear and coal. Otwoma believes the expense of generating nuclear energy could one day be met through shared regional projects but, until then, Kenya has to move forward on its own.</p><p>According to Rege, much as the nuclear energy alternative is promising, it is extremely important to take into consideration the Fukushima accident.</p><p>\"Data is available and it must be one step at a time without rushing things,\" he says.</p><p>Otwoma says the new nuclear Kenya can develop a good nuclear safety culture from the outset, \"but to do this we need to be willing to learn all the lessons and embrace them, not forget them and assume that won't happen to us\".<br /><strong>Oil barrels</strong></p><p>Nigeria: would nuclear bring more benefit than oil has?</p><p>Undeterred by Fukushima, Nigeria is forging ahead with nuclear collaborations.</p><p>There is no need to panic because of the Fukushima accident, says Shamsideen Elegba, chair of the Forum of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies in Africa. Nigeria has the necessary regulatory system to keep nuclear activities safe.</p><p>\"The Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority [NNRA] has established itself as a credible organisation for regulatory oversight on all uses of ionising radiation, nuclear materials and radioactive sources,\" says Elegba who was, until recently, the NNRA's director general.</p><p>\"It is not only that we say so: an international audit came here in 2006 to assess our procedure and processes and confirmed the same.</p><p>Elegba is firmly of the view that blame for the Fukushima accident should be allocated to nature rather than human error.</p><p>\"Japan is one of the leaders not only in that industry, but in terms of regulatory oversight. They have a very rigorous system of licensing. We have to make a distinction between a natural event, or series of natural events and engineering infrastructure, regulatory infrastructure, and safety oversight.\"</p><p>Erepamo Osaisai, Director General of the Nigeria Atomic Energy Commission (NAEC), has said there is \"no going back\" on Nigeria's nuclear energy project after Fukushima.</p><p>Nigeria is likely to recruit the Russian State Corporation for Atomic Energy, ROSATOM, to build its first proposed nuclear plant. A delegation visited Nigeria (26- 28 July) and a bilateral document is to be finalised before December.</p><p>Nikolay Spassy, director general of the corporation, said during the visit: \"The peaceful use of nuclear power is the bedrock of development, and achieving [Nigeria's] goal of being one of the twenty most developed countries by the year 2020 would depend heavily on developing nuclear power plants.\" ROSATOM points out that the International Atomic Energy Agency monitors and regulates power plant construction in previously non-nuclear countries.</p><p>But Nnimmo Bassey, executive director of the Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), said \"We cannot see the logic behind the government's support for a technology that former promoters in Europe, and other technologically advanced nations, are now applying brakes to.</p><p>\"What Nigeria needs now is investment in safe alternatives that will not harm the environment and the people. We cannot accept the nuclear option.\"<br /><strong>Cairo</strong></p><p>Egypt was the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to have a nuclear programme</p><p>Thirsty for electricity, and desirous of political clout, Egypt is determined that neither Fukushima ― nor revolution ― will derail its nuclear plans.</p><p>Egypt was the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to own a nuclear programme, launching a research reactor in 1961. In 2007 Egypt 'unfroze' a nuclear programme that had stalled in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster.</p><p>After the Egyptian uprising in early 2011, and the Fukushima accident, the government postponed an international tender for the construction of its first plant.</p><p>Yassin Ibrahim, chairman of the Nuclear Power Plants Authority, told SciDev.Net: \"We put additional procedures in place to avoid any states of emergency but, because of the uprising, the tender will be postponed until we have political stability after the presidential and parliamentary election at the end of 2011\".</p><p>Ibrahim denies the nuclear programme could be cancelled, saying: \"The design specifications for the Egyptian nuclear plant take into account resistance to earthquakes and tsunamis, including those greater in magnitude than any that have happened in the region for the last four thousand years.</p><p>\"The reactor type is of the third generation of pressurised water reactors, which have not resulted in any adverse effects to the environment since they began operation in the early sixties.\"</p><p>Ibrahim El-Osery, a consultant in nuclear affairs and energy at the country's Nuclear Power Plants Authority, points out that Egypt's limited resources of oil and natural gas will run out in 20 years.</p><p>\"Then we will have to import electricity, and we can't rely on renewable energy as it is still not economic yet — Egypt in 2010 produced only two per cent of its needs through it.\"</p><p>But there are other motives for going nuclear, says Nadia Sharara, professor of mineralogy at Assiut University.</p><p>\"Owning nuclear plants is a political decision in the first place, especially in our region. And any state that has acquired nuclear technology has political weight in the international community,\" she says. \"Egypt has the potential to own this power as Egypt's Nuclear Materials Authority estimates there are 15,000 tons of untapped uranium in Egypt.\"</p><p>And she points out it is about staying ahead with technology too. \"If Egypt freezes its programme now because of the Fukushima nuclear disaster it will fall behind in many science research fields for at least the next 50 years,\" she warned.</p><p>Articles written by Hanan AlKiswany (Jordan), Lizette Damons (South Africa), Mike Ives (Vietnam), Theresa V.

It certainly goes against much of the current international development agenda. For all their talk of \"best practices\", donors are keen to distance themselves from the \"one-size-fits-all\" approach they have been accused of adopting in the past, preferring instead to emphasise locality-specific solutions.</p><p></p><p>But how else to explain the results of the research I carried out in Ethiopia and Kenya last year?  Despite the vast historical differences between the two countries, leaders in both were remarkably eager to imitate other nations they saw as successful. Moreover, both groups looked to one region in particular: east Asia.</p><p></p><p>\"In my head, I've got practically everything mapped out – if you give me 10 years, I will give you South Korea,\" proclaimed one Kenyan technocrat.</p><p></p><p>\"We are 20 years behind China,\" said an Ethiopian bureaucrat, \"and we're trying to do what they did to get where they are.\"</p><p></p><p>These feelings are not just held privately, but make their way into policy and practice. Both Kenya's ambitious <a href=\"http://www.vision2030.go.ke/\" title=\"\">vision 2030</a> long-term development plan and Ethiopia's <a href=\"http://www.mofed.gov.et/English/Resources/Documents/GTP English2.pdf\" title=\"\">growth and transformation plan</a> (pdf) draw heavily on similar concepts in Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere in the region. All four foreign advisers on Kenya's <a href=\"http://www.nesc.go.ke/\" title=\"\">key national planning body</a> originate from east Asia, and pamphlets used to train cadres in Ethiopia's ruling party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, use Taiwan, South Korea and China as examples of agricultural development and state intervention. Most senior decision makers I spoke to had visited the region several times on <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTEDUCATION/0,,contentMDK:22177819~menuPK:282391~pagePK:64020865~piPK:51164185~theSitePK:282386,00.html\" title=\"\">dedicated study trips</a>, and such visits grow in number every year.</p><p></p><p>Asia (and especially China's) new and much-heralded economic ties with Africa may certainly have something to do with this, but not as much as one might expect. If economic dependency were all that mattered, the EU - still the biggest trading partner of, and donor to, Ethiopia and Kenya - would surely rank first as the model to follow. Instead, many Africans view east Asia's development experiences as more replicable, in the medium term, than those of the west, which seem slow, remote and academic by comparison. Policymakers have seen, in their own lifetimes, how countries such as China and Singapore were able to \"come of age\" in a hostile international environment. So why shouldn't they, too, be able to turn things around?</p><p></p><p>The lessons these governments draw from such models vary, but many hark back to principles that have become decidedly unpopular among mainstream western civil society and donors. Kenya and Ethiopia look at east Asia, and see the need for a strong and unifying national leadership that can transform and unite traditional communities into a new nation of \"modern\" citizens. This leadership is responsible for using the country's resources to build large and ambitious infrastructure projects, such as Ethiopia's controversial Gibe III dam. It oversees but does not control the economy, intervening directly where necessary to create globally competitive industries and sectors. It relies on advanced technology and double-digit economic growth to solve most of the country's problems.</p><p></p><p>So important is this economic growth, in fact, that democracy is hardly possible without it; countries develop in stages, they point out, and cannot be expected to become democratic overnight. All of these lessons are a far cry from both the market-led approach of the Washington consensus, and from the participatory, flexible and community-led route advocated by its critics.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ethiopian and Kenyan leaders do not claim to use east Asia as an exact blueprint for development. There is much talk of adapting foreign models to local social, historical and cultural realities. Nor do the two countries draw identical lessons: Kenya's history of capitalism means that it looks to economically liberal countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, while Ethiopia's communist past makes it more comfortable with countries that have a history of strong state intervention, such as China and South Korea. Many other factors will continue to influence development in Africa – not least how successfully these lessons are actually adapted and applied.</p><p></p><p>However, the fact that the east Asian model is so attractive to many African countries is bound to have profound implications for development practitioners. Western aid is not the only game in town anymore, and the global development agenda is no more immune from the influence of a rising Asia than the global economic system has turned out to be. Developing countries can now choose between an ever-growing variety of donors, trading partners, investors and development strategies. Whether or not we agree with the models they pick - or even with the idea of a development \"model\" at all - we would do well to listen to and engage with these views. There'll be no point in trying only to reform and improve western aid if the real debate is happening somewhere else.</p><p></p><p><em>• Elsje Fourie is a doctoral candidate at the school of international studies, University of Trento, Italy.

The three disasters mark an \"exponential change in crisis scale and impact\" and foreshadow a time of increasingly complex crises and multiple, simultaneous disasters.</p><p>The 2011 <a href=\"http://www.ifrc.org/publications-and-reports/world-disasters-report/wdr2011/\" title=\"\">World Disasters Report</a>, published on Thursday, builds on disaster data compiled by researchers at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium. Put together by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the report looks back on a decade of disasters around the world, and this year focuses on food security and malnutrition in an attempt to widen discussion about crisis prevention and response.</p><p>While food security and nutrition have long been at the centre of relief efforts, the report stresses that much food aid is still delivered in inappropriate ways, too little and too late, and that \"a full assessment of progress is overdue for the [humanitarian] sector\".</p><p>The disconnect between humanitarian action and development projects is at the core of the problem, insists the report, as humanitarian funds are usually short-term, focusing on an immediate disaster rather than building up local capacity to manage recurrent crises. The rising price of food also \"puts vulnerable populations everywhere at greater risk and allows smaller shocks to push them over the brink of survival\".</p><p>Here are some key points from the report:</p><blockquote><p>• last year was the 21st century's deadliest, with 297,752 deaths caused by natural disasters. This exceeds deaths in 2004 (242,010) and 2008 (235,272)</p><p>• the vast majority of deaths in 2010 (222,570) were attributable to the earthquake in Haiti – the second deadliest natural disaster of the last decade</p><p>• more than 300 million people were reportedly affected by natural disasters in 2010, second only to 2002 when 709 million people were affected</p><p>• of those affected by natural disasters in 2010, 60% were hit by floods, with 134 million people affected by flooding in China and more than 20 million affected by flooding in the Indus river basin in Pakistan</p><p>• Compared with the last decade of the 20th century, disaster deaths rose by 39% in the 2000-10 period. The number of people affected by disasters also rose, by 10%.</p></blockquote><p><br />The data comes from the Cred EM-DAT database, run out of the school of public health at Belgium's Catholic University of Louvain. EM-DAT compiles core data on the occurrence and impact of more than 18,000 disasters, stretching as far back as 1900.</p><p>For a disaster to be included in the database, at least one of the following criteria must be fulfilled: 10 people or more reported killed; 100 people or more reported affected; state of emergency declared; international assistance requested.</p><p>The number of people killed includes those confirmed dead and those missing and presumed dead. \"People affected\" are those needing immediate life-saving assistance, such as food, water, shelter, sanitation and urgent medical attention.</p><p>We've pulled out some of the key data from the report.

telescope","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-14T19:03:55Z","sectionId":"science","id":"world/2011/sep/14/africa-readies-host-powerful-telescope","fields":{"body":"<p>Sitting in a white prefab hut, Lindsay Magnus punches a code into a computer beneath bands of red, green and blue representing the Centaurus A galaxy. Beyond the window, seven giant dishes turn in unison, throwing shadows across the gravel. Their target lies millions of light years away in the cosmos.</p><p>Magnus and his colleagues are aiming to build the world's biggest telescope. It will cost £1.3bn and consist of thousands of dishes with a total surface area of one square kilometre. It will generate enough raw data to fill 15m 64 GB iPods every day, requiring a supercomputer 1,000 times faster than currently exists. It will peer back to a time before the first stars and galaxies formed and offer our best chance yet of detecting alien intelligence.</p><p>And there is a strong chance the telescope will be African. Bids will be submitted on Thursday to host the <a href=\"http://www.skatelescope.org\" title=\"\">Square Kilometre Array</a> (SKA), an instrument that turns radio waves into pictures of galaxies, exploding stars and other space phenomena. The <a href=\"http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/4280/full\" title=\"\">contest</a> pitches <a href=\"http://www.ska.ac.za\" title=\"\">South Africa (in partnership with eight other African countries)</a> against <a href=\"http://www.ska.gov.au\" title=\"\">Australia and New Zealand</a>.</p><p>Both contenders offer vast tracts of land with tiny populations – vital to avoid interference from mobile phones and other electronics. Both are also in the southern hemisphere, which offers a better perspective on the centre of our galaxy but which has been relatively neglected to date. An old joke has it: \"God put all the astronomers in the northern hemisphere and all the interesting objects in the southern.\"</p><p>But Africa would also have political purchase. A continent often written off as broken and doomed, and a backwater of scientific research is on the verge of landing one of the most important astronomical projects of the early 21st century. Much was said about last year's football World Cup as a blow to \"Afro-pessimism.\"</p><p>The SKA could be a galvanising moment for its intellectual capital, self-confidence and prestige around the world. \"I work in a world class field and now I can do it at home, I don't have to go overseas,\" said Magnus, commissioning scientist at the Karoo Array Telescope (KAT-7), a prototype of the SKA. \"If it comes to Africa, conversations will happen that never could have happened.</p><p>\"If you were to think about the way to impact people here with science, there's no better way. Children already know there's something big going on – it's broadening their horizons. It's very different from the daily toll of war, famine and poverty.\"</p><p>KAT-7 is an array of seven 16-metre-tall dishes undergoing tests in the Karoo desert. Staff charter a weekly flight from Cape Town to the <a href=\"[http://www.carnarvon.co.za]\" title=\"\">Northern Cape village of Carnarvon</a>, then drive for an hour into a wilderness where only sheep, springboks and hardy farmers venture. Mobile phone reception soon disappears, which is just the way the researchers like it.</p><p>This is a quarantined zone where anything that emits radio frequency interference (RFI) is like an infectious disease. Internet connections are by fibre optic cables only. \"Wifi is a curse word round here,\" one scientist observed.</p><p>Such is the dishes' sensitivity that their \"cold\" receivers are cryogenically cooled to about 70 kelvin (-203C) to reduce \"noise\". Banks of data servers, with green and red lights scrolling left and right below humming air conditioners, are sealed inside RFI-shielded containers with thick metal doors providing \"radio airlocks\".</p><p>The staff kitchen, including a potentially intrusive microwave oven, and recreation room are hidden safely behind a lone hill (\"Losberg\" in Afrikaans) in isolated buildings that resemble a lunar base. A notice on the wall gives emergency contact numbers and reassurance that Carnarvon hospital is \"stocked with snake anti-venom\".</p><p>The heavy data lifting, however, is performed hundreds of miles away at a control room beneath Table Mountain in Cape Town. Here, staff sit at computer screens looking at what appear to be red and yellow blobs but actually represent 10 hours' observation of galaxies such as PKS 1610-60, some 240m light years away.</p><p>Dr Deborah Shepherd, project scientist and commissioning manager, has moved from her native America to join the team. \"You have a fresh outlook on things in South Africa,\" she said. \"The innovation that's coming out is incredible. They're not limited by the way things have been done in the past.\"</p><p>\"During apartheid, South Africans have to pitch in and get on with things themselves. They are willing to change if they get it wrong. When they make mistakes, they figure out how to solve them.\"</p><p>The project says it has created jobs for about a hundred young scientists and engineers with skills in \"next generation\" technologies. It has funded nearly 300 bursaries for astronomy, engineering and physics students and says astronomy is now being taught in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius and Zambia.</p><p>But in South Africa, where economic and educational disparaties persist between the white minority and black majority, diversity is a hypersensitive issue. Dr Bernie Fanaroff, the country's SKA project director, said: \"If you look at astronomy around the world, it's heavily dominated by middle aged white men. We've tried very hard to get women and black astronomers and engineers into the programme.</p><p>\"If you go to a number of European countries, you'll see that the proportion of women in our programme is much higher, so we're doing quite well. It's been quite difficult to get black astronomers and engineers. Some of the technologies that we're dealing with are technologies that black students haven't gone into — things like digital signal processing.\"</p><p>Fanaroff added: \"We've been finding young people and bringing them into our training programmes as far as we can. We haven't gone nearly far enough, but if you look at our bursary programme for instance, more than half the bursaries and grants have gone to black students, and I think it's about 40% have gone to women.\" Next, KAT-7 will grow into MeerKAT, a £130m radio telescope with 64 dishes that will rival the current world leader, the Very Large Array in New Mexico. But even MeerKAT, due to be completed by 2016-17, is a mere \"baby step\" towards the SKA.</p><p>This will cost £1.3bn to build and about £130m a year to operate. Construction will start in 2016 and take eight years, funded by a UK-based consortium likely to be made up of 16 countries. They will choose next year between Africa and Australia.</p><p>If Africa wins, around 3,000 dishes will be spread across more than 3,000km in South Africa and its partners. Fanaroff said: \"It's changing the way South Africa is seen, not just as yet another African country which is a basket case but actually as a science and technology leader.</p><p>\"A lot of African countries are now recognising the importance of science and technology in development. Africa has not been perceived up to now as a place where you do science and technology, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be in the future.</p><p>\"People are talking about Africa as the next great business destination. You've probably seen the McKinsey report about the African lions, which makes the point that it's not only in resource extraction, it's also in manufacturing and so on. We want to take that further into hi-tech now.</p><p>\"I would like South Africa in particular, but Africa in general, to be seen as a place where you can do world class science and technology.\"</p><p>At a presentation in London earlier this year, Fanaroff floated an inevitable question: \"We have immediate priorities like housing, poverty, education, transport, so why would we spend money on astronomy?\"</p><p>MeerKAT project manager Willem Esterhuyse has at least one answer.</p><p>\"You can say we're going to cater to basic needs and be a third world country, or you can push technology and be there with the best,\" he said.</p><p>\"The World Cup showed we're a country on the way up, a country that can do things. You need to inspire innovators and teach people hard skills so they can develop things that sell and create jobs. There are a lot of potential spin-offs from what we do.\"</p><h2>Size matters</h2><p>\"To observe the most distant and ancient objects in the cosmos, scientists turn to telescopes of staggering proportions. The reason is simple: in astronomy, size matters.</p><p>Larger telescopes can collect more light (and other forms of electromagnetic radiation) than smaller ones. In doing so, they can see fainter objects that are farther away, such as stars that formed earlier in the life of the universe.</p><p>The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will gather radiowaves instead of visible light, giving it advantages over traditional optical telescopes. Radiotelescopes can see through inclement weather, operate in daylight hours and are less troubled by cosmic dust. They can pick up radiowaves from cold hydrogen atoms that are ubiquitous in space, allowing astronomers to map the heavens in a radically different way.</p><p>These advantages come at a price. Just as optical telescopes can be blinded by the sun and artificial lighting, radiotelescopes are best built in remote locations, far from sources of radiowaves, such as mobile phone base stations.</p><p>The largest radiotelescope in operation, near Arecibo in Puerto Rico, collects radiowaves over an area of 73,000 square metres, and has a long list of discoveries to its name. Using the telescope, astronomers spotted the first planets outside our solar system, confirmed Einstein's theory of general relativity and measured the rotation of Mercury.</p><p>The SKA will have a collecting area of one million square metres, making it 50 times more sensitive than any other telescope. With it, astronomers hope to see as far back as the cosmic \"dark ages\", the period before the first stars blinked into being. Others will study how the first black holes formed, look for signs of alien life, and possibly unravel the mystery of the dark energy that drives the expansion of the universe.</p><p>Instead of one giant telescope dish, the SKA will use 3,000 smaller dishes, each around 15m-wide, spread out over thousands of kilometres. These will collect high frequency radiowaves, while two other kinds of receptors, will pick up medium and low frequency waves. The signals from all of the receivers are combined and sent along a fibre optic cable to a high performance computer for processing.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/9/14/1316026990508/Square-Kilometre-Array--003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/14/africa-readies-host-powerful-telescope","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/sep/14/africa-readies-host-powerful-telescope","sectionName":"Science"},{"webTitle":"Politics live blog + PMQs - Wednesday 14 September 2011","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-14T15:17:00Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/blog/2011/sep/14/politics-blog-pmqs-live","fields":{"body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p><strong></strong></p><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">8.38am:</span> The main party conference season starts this weekend, marking the start of the annual, three-week festival of frenzied, partisan politicking.

This is a fight for what Europe represents in the world.

The right way to stop the negative cycle and strengthen the euro is to deepen integration, mainly in the euro area.

I've got the Clegg speech on my desk and I'm reading it now. I'll post a summary shortly.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.25am:</span> With the economy stalling, the government is desperate to persuade voters that it is not just slashing spending and sitting on its hands, but that it is actually doing something to promote growth too. That's what Nick Clegg's speech on the economy today was all about. Here are the main points. The full text is <a href=\"http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/speech-economy-london-school-economics\">on the Cabinet Office website.</a></p><p><strong>• Clegg said ministers would shaking the money tree in Whitehall to make sure that cash allocated for infrastructure projects actually gets spent. </strong>He is going to identify 40 big infrastructure projects and make sure that they do not get held up. It is hard to know what effect this will have and, when asked to say how much these projects would be worth (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2011/sep/14/politics-blog-pmqs-live#block-13\">11.12am),</a> Clegg would not give an answer. Is there really that much money lying about not being spent. According to Clegg, yes.</p><blockquote><p><br />So Whitehall will put its foot on the accelerator, making sure we deliver on our commitments. To that end, I can announce that we're going through the nation's capital spending plans to hand-pick up to 40 of the biggest infrastructure projects, the ones most important to growth, which will be given new special priority status. Each will be rigorously examined by Ministers to make sure there are no delays, no blockages and the economy feels the benefits as quickly as possible. That includes, for example, high speed broadband rollout, work to transform the efficiency of the national grid, major improvements to the rail network, like Crossrail and Great Western Electrification and projects to reduce congestion on our road network. Targeting pinch points on the M1, the M25, and elsewhere ...</p><p>To make sure it happens across the board, Danny Alexander, the chief secretary, will be tasked with shaking the Whitehall tree so no-one is stockpiling capital that can be put to good use today.</p></blockquote><p><strong>• Clegg said that the government would be encouraging the private sector to invest more in the UK.</strong> He mentioned various initiatives including: Chris Huhne identifying the support available for renewable energy a year ahead of schedule; Lord Green, the trade minister, and Lord Sassoon, the Treasury minister, making trips abroad to encourage investors to put money in Britain; Greg Clark, the planning minister, drawing up plans to help councils raise money for investment; and Philip Hammond, the transport secretary, announcing plans tomorrow to give councils more power over funding transport schemes.</p><p><strong>• Clegg acknowledged that the economic situation was \"much worse than before\".</strong></p><blockquote><p>The international situation has changed dramatically. It is worse, even, to just six months ago. To quote Christine Lagarde, the new head of the IMF: 'We are in a dangerous new phase'.</p></blockquote><p><strong>• He said it was a mistake for the Tories to use the Eurozone crisis as an excuse to start planning how to use an EU treaty renegotiation to repatriate powers from the EU.</strong> As Roland Watson says<a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3163594.ece\"> in the Times today</a> (paywall), George Osborne told the cabinet yesterday that negotiations for a new EU treaty could begin as soon as 2013. \"William Hague is already drawing up negotiating plans that include demands for the EU to repatriate powers in areas such as employment law to Britain,\" Watson reports. \"Some officials believe that there could be two new treaties in the coming years: one to allow eurozone countries to co-operate more closely and a more far-reaching one to recalibrate the EU's reach.\" But Clegg indicated that this was a mistake.</p><blockquote><p>On a day like today, when people are talking openly about the possibility of Greek default, the key question is not: how do we seek to renegotiate the UK's place in the European Union in a treaty that hasn't even materialised yet. The single-most important question, the urgent  question is what role can we play in helping the Eurozone avoid further turmoil, creating the stability needed for prosperity and jobs – in the Eurozone and in the UK too.</p></blockquote><p>Clegg said Britain should instead focus on making the single market more effective.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.54am:</span> My colleague Dan Milmo has sent me a note about what the various union leaders have been saying about strike action at the TUC conference.</p><p>From <strong>Paul Kenny</strong>, GMB general secretary</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>If Francis Maude thinks everything is going to be alright he had better get into practice in emptying rubbish bins and sweeping the streets.

The other reason was that it was just tacky. Until then, Miliband was doing quite well. The argument about who's to blame for the economy still hovering on the brink of the recession is the most important one around at the moment, and Miliband and Cameron rehearsed the key points reasonably well. Miliband was at his best when he used the killer short question: Where are the jobs? But Cameron was armed with a reference to Alistair Darling's book, a line from Miliband's speech yesterday and his \"so Labour left us a golden inheritance, you're saying\" riff (which still works, even though he has used it before) and this probably gave him the upper hand.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.07pm:</span> Here's a lunchtime summary.<br /><strong><br />• Union leaders have announced plans for what could be the biggest outbreak of industrial action since the 1926 General Strike.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/sep/14/unions-ballot-members-pension-reforms\">As Hélène Mulholland and Dan Milmo report, </a>Britain's three biggest unions - Unite, Unison and the GMB - have drawn up plans for a mass strike day followed by more sustained action in tactical and \"smart\" strikes, which would target specific services and could have an immediate impact without affecting vulnerable groups. The mass national walkout could be timed to coincide with George Osborne's pre-budget report statement in parliament on 29 November. Unions are warning that rolling strikes could go on until next summer, suggesting that the Queen's jubilee and the 2012 Olympics could be targets. Commenting on the union plans, Nick Clegg said: \"It is very regrettable that they are rushing to announce days of strikes when the discussions are still ongoing. It would lovely to wave a magic wand and say we have discovered pots of gold, and the ageing population is not ageing, and, hallelujah, pension funds are entirely sustainable.

The Office for National Statistics also said the number of people out of work rose by 80,000 in the three months to July, reaching 2.51m, mainly due to a sharp rise in youth unemployment. At PMQs David Cameron said the figures were \"disappointing\". He went on: \"There is not one ounce of complacency in this government about the need to do more to get people back into work. We have a growth plan that includes cuts in corporation tax, freezing the council tax, cuts in petrol duty, introducing the regional growth fund, making sure we have enterprise zones in every part of our country. But in every week, and in every month, we'll be adding to that growth programme so we help people get back to work.\" But Miliband said the government was \"a byword for complacency\".

If Greek citizens had just seen the value of their bank deposits cut in half as the new drachma was devalued, why would anyone hold bank deposits in other troubled members of the euro? Willem Buiter at Citigroup argued yesterday that the ensuing bank run could be so disastrous that the eurozone must try to keep Greece inside the euro at any price.</p><p>That would involve offering yet more money to a member state which had just defaulted on most of its public debt. Greece would still be uncompetitive within the euro, and may start to build up a renewed debt mountain, courtesy of foreign lending. Surely this would not be politically sustainable in Germany. And other troubled countries might choose the same path as Greece, which would simply increase the scale of the dilemma facing Germany and other lenders.</p><p>In short, the option of an early Greek default looks fraught with problems, whether or not Greece leaves the euro at the same time. That is why Mrs Merkel still seems determined to give the Greeks one last chance to deliver.</p></blockquote><p>• Gavin Kelly <a href=\" http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/gavin-kelly/2011/09/women-support-coalition\">on his New Statemsan blog</a> on why coalition ministers are so worried about the way they are losing the support of women.</p><blockquote><p>It's well established  that at the last general election, women were on average more likely to vote for the Liberal Democrats than men (26 per cent v 22 per cent), as well as Labour (31 per cent v 28 per cent).</p><p>Less understood and more interesting are the staggering variations that exist underneath these headline figures. Women aged 25-34 were more likely to vote for Labour than the Conservatives (11-point lead) whereas C2 female voters (of all ages) were dramatically more likely to back the Conservatives than Labour (by a remarkable 17 points), fully reversing Labour's towering 18 point advantage among the same group in 1997.</p><p>Following the 2010 election, during the early and easy days of the Coalition, Tory support climbed among women, reaching a commanding 45 per cent in one poll at the end of 2010, hovering just below 40 per cent in others, compared to around 34 per cent of men.

He urged female farmers to plant cleaner rice seeds, those that did not look dirty and discoloured. Sure enough, using healthier rice seeds led to a big increase in yield.</p><p>\"The women were very excited, but for cultural reasons they could not share their discovery by going from village to village, but they did make a video to spread the word,\" said Holderness in a phone interview from Rome. \"That video went all [a]round Bangladesh and eventually reached west Africa.\"</p><p>Holderness is executive secretary of the <a href=\"http://www.egfar.org/egfar/website/aboutgfar\" title=\"\">Global Forum on Agricultural Research (GFAR)</a>, which was established to shift the focus of agricultural research and development to meet the needs of the world's poor, the group most affected by the two big food crises in the past four years. Those crises were fuelled by several global trends: growing population, expanding incomes in emerging countries such as China and India, conversion of food crops to biofuels, and climate change.</p><p>The Montpellier meeting underlines the importance that G20 countries are putting on agriculture, especially in the developing world. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/jun/23/g20-action-plan-to-curb-food-prices\" title=\"\">G20 agriculture ministers held their first summit in Paris</a> in June, where they agreed an action plan to deal with volatility in food prices. The focus of this week's meeting will be a bigger version of what Holderness experienced in Bangladesh.</p><p>The meeting will be opened by the French agriculture minister, Bruno Le Maire, who has made a big push for the importance of agriculture in the G20. Participants will include Tang Huajun, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and Andrew Westby, director of the Natural Resources Institute in the UK.</p><p>The G20 group, consisting of the <a href=\"http://www.g20.org/about_what_is_g20.aspx\" title=\"\">world's leading economies</a> – including China and South Africa – is a powerhouse of both agricultural innovation and production, with around 70% of scientific publications on agriculture and around 60% of agricultural exports. The G20 also leads in areas such as information and communication technologies, which can change the way agricultural knowledge is made available.</p><p>But with an alphabet soup of organisations involved in agricultural research at national and international level, developing a coherent approach, setting out priorities and fulfilling objectives is problematic. Montpellier has four specific objectives: increased co-operation and co-ordination of research policies and programmes on food security; effective and innovative research partnerships for development and better impact of research from <a href=\"http://www.cgiar.org/\" title=\"\">the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research</a>; stronger capacities in agriculture technologies for poor countries and synergies between G20 agricultural research systems; and greater involvement of the G20 agricultural research systems in the second global conference on agricultural research for development (Gcard) in Uruguay in 2012.</p><p>Holderness said it was particularly important for poor countries to learn from the success of emerging economies such as China and Brazil.</p><p>\"How do we spread the knowledge not just from China and Brazil but from suppliers, informational technology providers,\" he said. \"Not just scientific knowledge, but innovations and practices that can be shared and made relevant to farmers. The core message of the meeting is that the G20 recognises the importance of agricultural research. It's good it's happening at all, but we are looking for not just more talk but action.\"</p><p>Montpellier will feed into the G20 joint finance/development meeting in September in Washington and the G20 summit in Cannes in November. Success can only be measured in tangible effects on the ground. In their discussions on food security and self-reliance, ministers should be asking themselves what impact they will have on a woman farmer in Kenya with a few acres, who is struggling to grow crops on semi-arid soil to feed her family and generate income for school revenues.</p><p>Farmers like her are keen to embrace innovations such as zai pits, which hold fertiliser and water to help crops grow, because they have seen how these can increase yields of drought-resistance crops such as cowpeas, pigeon peas and sorghum. But they face very basic challenges. How do they afford to buy a hoe that costs $70, or transport their crops to market?</p><p>\"We need to look at innovation in a broader social context,\" Holderness said. \"We have to bring in women at the start – there is access to microfinance, access to water for sharing, schemes for producers to organise themselves for access to markets. The technology is essential but not sufficient in itself.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/9/1315564898818/Bangladesh-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/sep/12/g20-faces-obstacles-farming-practices","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/sep/12/g20-faces-obstacles-farming-practices","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Hand axes unearthed in Kenya are oldest advanced stone tools ever found","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-31T17:09:00Z","sectionId":"science","id":"science/2011/aug/31/hand-axes-oldest-advanced-stone-tools","fields":{"body":"<p>A rare haul of picks, flakes and hand axes recovered from ancient sediments in Kenya are the oldest remains of advanced stone tools yet discovered.</p><p>Archaeologists unearthed the implements while excavating mudstone banks on the shores of Lake Turkana in the remote north-west of the country.</p><p>The largest of the tools are around 20cm long and have been chipped into shape on two sides, a hallmark of more sophisticated stone toolmaking techniques probably developed by <em>Homo erectus</em>, an ancestor of modern humans.</p><p>Trenches dug at the same site revealed remains of long-gone species that shared the land with those who left the tools behind.

This, Kent said, presents a problem if <em>H. erectus</em> originated in Africa and migrated to Asia, as many archaeologists believe. \"Why didn't <em>Homo erectus</em> take these tools with them to Asia?\"</p><p>One radical explanation offered by researchers is that <em>H. erectus</em> originated in Asia instead of Africa.

In fact some researchers believe the first exodus from Africa could have been even earlier than the date for Dmanisi, by a pre-erectus population making Oldowan tools,\" he said.</p><p>\"In the deep past, with small populations that were prone to local or wider extinctions, innovations did not always take hold and spread. Novelties like blade tools and bows and arrows may have been invented and reinvented many times over, due to the loss of individuals and populations, and the knowledge they carried.</p><p>\"So we cannot be sure that the tools found at Kokiselei were really the beginning of the establishment of the Acheulian.

According to Léo Apotheker, the chief executive since September, the PSG chunk might be spun off, sold off, or (perhaps) just kept inside HP.</p><p>In a follow-up interview, Dell crowed at the prospect of HP shedding its PC business, as he thinks that will lead to more business for him in the pricier server business (which HP is hanging on to), just as happened after IBM sold its PC business to Lenovo in&nbsp;2004.</p><p>For Dell, focused on selling PCs and \"big iron\", the billions in revenues to be soaked up from HP's likely exit from the PC business look appetising. But that doesn't alter the suspicion that Dell is looking in the wrong direction if what he's after is profitable growth.</p><p>The trouble with the Windows PC business is that while it might be growing, just (at about 2% this year), it's become commodified. Even HP can only wring $40 of profit from each $800 (on average) PC it sells. Microsoft makes about the same profit per Windows licence – ie, per PC. The Windows division is the second-most profitable in Microsoft (after the one that sells Office); PSG is HP's least profitable division.</p><p>But you don't have to sell PCs. A fascinating story last week detailed how United and Continental Airlines, the US's biggest, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/aug/24/ipads-paper-manuals\" title=\"\">replacing heavy bags full of flight plans with Apple iPads</a>: a special app will hold the charts, and be updated wirelessly with new information. As well as the saving in weight, they're more convenient, and with a long enough battery life, they'll last all but the longest flights without charging. \"The paperless flight deck represents the next generation of flying,\" said United's senior vice-president of flight operations, Captain Fred Abbott. Computing is becoming something that just gets done where it's needed, not in the temple of a device with a physical keyboard, Intel chip and 12-inch screen perched on a table or lap.</p><p>Look further afield, and you see more examples of how computing is no longer tied to being on a PC: smartphone sales are still growing at 50% annually (and app downloads with them); since the fourth quarter of last year they have outsold PCs every quarter. The potential market there is billions of people, and manufacturers in China are taking advantage of it: ZTE is building a $150 smartphone which, says Richard Windsor, business analyst at the stockbrokers Nomura, is \"the sweet spot\" for China's potentially enormous market. Presently around 60 million people there have such a device, but by 2015 that's expected to hit 112 million – out of 800 million mobile users. (For contrast, by the end of 2012 Nomura reckons the EU will have 108 million smartphone users – representing 48% penetration – and the US 157 million, or 67%.)</p><p>And in Africa there's similar growth: Safaricom, an internet service provider (ISP) in Kenya, is getting into low-end smartphones costing about $50 (nothing to you, but a princely sum there – but still substantially below that for a PC). So far it has sold 350,000, indicating how far the market has to go there too. But you can see the potential. Why buy a PC when you can get something that can do computing for a tenth of the price, and lasts all day on a single charge?</p><p>If you were looking around for markets to conquer, then you'd certainly think that smartphones in the emerging nations, or tablets and smartphones in the developed world, looked like the better bet; the PC by contrast just looks like a commodity that has reached its end state. Worst of all for the makers, PCs have essentially become fungible commodities, like wheat or oil: any one is interchangeable, and buyers are led by price. Dell's problem is that it hasn't managed to make any impact at all in smartphones or tablets. So obviously its chief insists that the PC isn't dead. But it's hard not to think that it's answering the door with a bleary expression, still wearing its pyjamas and slippers at midday, while computing becomes something everyone can do everywhere.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2011/8/26/1314379989751/pilot-iPad--003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/28/future-of-pcs-charles-arthur","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2011/aug/28/future-of-pcs-charles-arthur","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"David Steel linked to businessman facing bribery allegations","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-21T16:28:59Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2011/aug/21/lord-david-steel-uganda-nigeria","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>This article is the subject of a legal complaint made on behalf of Dr Benoy Berry in addition to General Mediterranean Holding SA (\"GMH\") and its Founder and Chairman, Mr Nadhmi Auchi.</strong></p><p><hr /></p><p>The Liberal Democrat grandee David Steel lobbied the president of Uganda to land a profitable contract for a former business partner who is now the subject of an international bribery inquiry, an investigation by the Guardian has established.</p><p>Lord Steel, the former Liberal party leader, was hired by the businessman, Benoy Berry, to give credibility to his firm's bid to win a $100m contract from the Ugandan government.</p><p>The Scottish peer lobbied the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, after he was paid to go to the country's capital, Kampala.</p><p>Steel, who led the Liberal party for 12 years before moving to the House of Lords, has faced criticism over his directorships in the past.</p><p>Berry is being investigated over alleged corrupt payments to secure contracts for a different company in another African country, Nigeria.</p><p>The Serious Fraud Office (SFO), in collaboration with Australian police, has made a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/oct/06/two-held-in-bribery-investigation-australia\" title=\"\">series of arrests and raids</a> during their inquiry into alleged multimillion bribes to Nigerians.

An <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/document/2011/08/20110816_Report_Financing_the_Response_to_AIDS.pdf\" title=\"\">annual funding analysis</a> by UNAids and the Kaiser Family Foundation, released this week, shows donors gave $6.9bn in 2010 for HIV prevention, care, treatment and support – down $740m from 2009.</p><p>The decrease comes when innovative methods to stop the spread of HIV are emerging. Earlier this year, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/14/hiv-daily-pill-breakthrough\" title=\"\">groundbreaking studies in Botswana, Kenya, and Uganda</a>, found that partners of people living with HIV can protect themselves from infection by taking a once-daily pill. At the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/05/aids-treatment-funding\" title=\"\">UN high-level meeting on Aids</a> in June, donors committed to put another 9 million people on treatment by 2015, raising the total number of those receiving HIV treatment to 15 million.</p><p>But mobilising the resources needed to take advantage of new treatments, and raising funds to meet the \"15 by 15\" goal, now looks more challenging than at any time in the past 10 years.</p><p>This week's study shows funding for HIV and Aids programmes in low- and middle-income countries increased more than six-fold between 2002 and 2008, before levelling off in 2009 and dropping in 2010. Much of this change is attributed to the impact of the global financial crisis on government budgets.</p><p>Of the 15 donors surveyed by the report, seven had rolled back their funding for HIV and Aids programmes in 2010. Some of the overall drop is due to fluctuations in countries' exchange rates. But the fall is largely driven by a reduction in disbursements from the US: \"as the single largest donor, the US delay affected the overall financial picture for the year,\" said the report.</p><p>While Washington appropriated about $5.5bn for Aids in both 2009 and 2010, disbursements dropped from $4.4bn in 2009 to $3.7bn in 2010. Figures are not yet available for 2011.</p><p>Despite the drop in funding, Bernhard Schwartlander, director of evidence, strategy and results for UNAids, insists: \"We haven't seen a decrease in access to services. More people have received treatment than ever before.\"</p><p>\"Even though we have seen – for the first time – a significant decrease in funding from international donors, we have also seen programmes become more efficient,\" explains Schwartlander. \"But could we have done more if we had more resources? That, of course, is a very different question.\"</p><p>A key issue is whether the decrease in funding in 2010 is a one-off drop or the beginning of a new trend. If donor contributions to the fight against HIV and Aids continue to shrink, \"it will be impossible to get where we need to go,\" says Schwartlander.</p><p>\"The drop in funding may be a temporary blip,\" says Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of global health policy and HIV for the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"However, given <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/01/us-foreign-aid-cuts\" title=\"\">the budget battles in Washington</a> – and the fact that the US provides the majority of donor government funding for the Aids response – the future of Aids financing remains unclear.\"</p><p>UNAids estimates that at least $22bn will be needed by 2015 to reach the millennium development goal targets to ensure universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. This level of funding could prevent more than 12 million new HIV infections and avert more than 7 million deaths, says this week's study.</p><p>At June's UN meeting, commitments were reaffirmed to raise funding for the global Aids response to $22-24bn by 2015.</p><p>Some key points from this week's report:</p><blockquote><p>• Of the 15 governments surveyed for the study, donations from seven – Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the US – dropped in 2010.</p><p>• While $8.7bn was committed towards the global fight against HIV and Aids in 2010, only $6.9bn was actually disbursed.</p><p>• In 2010, despite the slowdown in disbursements from Washington, the US was still the largest donor, accounting for more than half (54.2%) of Aids funding.</p><p>• But, taking into account the different sizes of government economies, the US ranks seventh in Aids funding as a share of GDP. Denmark ranks first, followed by the Netherlands, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway.</p><p>• Overall, funding increased more than sixfold between 2002 and 2008, before levelling off in 2009 and dropping in 2010. The biggest year-on-year jump in funding was between 2007 and 2008, when flows rose from $4.9bn to $7.7bn.</p></blockquote><p>Note that the data in the report focuses on funding for the delivery of HIV-related services – from prevention and care to treatment and support – and doesn't include funding for international HIV research carried out in donor countries.</p><p>And just because overall funding has dropped doesn't mean that all Aids programs have suffered a shrink in resources. Different programmes may attract different levels of funding. In November, UNAids is expected to release a more detailed analysis of financing for the global Aids response, looking in part at the support received by different types of programmes.</p><p>Here we're highlighting the data from this week's report. We've also looked at previous funding analyses, extracting figures on countries' past commitments and disbursements.

agricultural experts on Thursday stressed the need for long-term measures to avoid a repetition of the crisis in the Horn of Africa that has left 12 million hungry.</p><p>As aid agencies poured supplies into Mogadishu, Somalia, the country most severely affected through a combination of drought and conflict, officials at the Food and Agriculture Organisation held a <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/crisis/horn-africa/emergency-meeting-aug-2011/en/\" title=\"\">second emergency meeting</a> in less than a month to take stock of the humanitarian disaster.</p><p>While acknowledging the need for immediate emergency aid, they emphasised the need for actions and policies to prevent famine from recurring. \"We must think not only about saving lives today, but build sustainable livelihoods to avoid future calamities,\" said Jacques Diouf, the FAO president. \"What the world is seeing now is the unfortunate result of three decades of underinvestment in agriculture and underdevelopment.\"</p><p>He said while countries in the region had prepared comprehensive investment plans for agriculture, funding was missing. \"Unless these plans are carried out, famine will return to shame the international community,\" said Diouf. \"With the financial resources, technology and expertise at our disposal, it is inadmissible for 12 million people to be at risk of starvation today. We have the opportunity to help these people out of crisis by building more livelihoods more resilient to climate shocks.\"</p><p>Kenya's agriculture minister, Romano Kiome, said long-term solutions to drought had not been taken seriously. He stressed the need to make available drought-resistant seeds to farmers, building small irrigation projects as well as infrastructure, so that food can be moved quickly round the region. Kiome also said the world needed to make the link between the problems of food production and climate change.</p><p>The FAO meeting was part of a flurry of diplomatic activity focusing on the Horn, where relief agencies are in a race against time as the famine is expected to spread in Somalia in the coming months. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference countries pledged $350m in aid for Somalia at an emergency summit in Istanbul on Wednesday and the African Union is to hold a pledging conference in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, next week.</p><p>Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, who visited Mogadishu on Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/aug/17/uk-development-mitchell-somalia-children\" title=\"\">warned that up to 400,000 children could die</a> through starvation if urgent action is not taken to help Somalia and its neighbours.</p><p>As Mitchell visited Mogadishu, Britain announced an extra £25m ($41m) in emergency aid for Somalia. The new package will go through Unicef, allowing the UN organisation for children to double the number of children it is reaching in its supplementary programme.</p><p>Across Somalia, 3.7 million people – nearly half of the Somali population – are now in crisis, two-thirds of whom reside in the south, which is under the control of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/16/q-a-somalia-al-shabaab\" title=\"\">al-Shabaab</a>, the Islamist militants, who oppose the presence of the UN's World Food Programme in the belief that food aid undermines local food production. Unicef, however, does have a presence in the south as its focus on children is deemed more acceptable than the WFP's.</p><p>The crisis has forced tens of thousands of Somalis to flee to neighbouring countries, including Ethiopia, Djibouti and, particularly, Kenya. The number of refugees at Kenya's Dadaab complex has reached 400,000. The UNHCR, the UN body for refugees, today started moving 200 people into the camp known as Ifo 2 – part of the new Ifo extension site. Ifo 2, which has 116 brick houses, had been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/11/somali-refugees-kenya-camp-empty\" title=\"\">standing empty for months</a> because of growing local opposition to the influx of refugees.</p><p>The refugees are being bussed in from the outskirts of Dagahaley, one of the three camps at Dadaab, where recently arrived refugees are living in very difficult conditions, with poor sanitation and little access to services or security. The plan is to move around 90,000 people into the Ifo extension camps by November. So far around 17,000 refugees have moved into the Ifo extension site.</p><p>While welcoming the consensus in Rome, Oxfam pointed out that a huge funding gap remained despite fresh aid pledges this week.</p><p>\"This week some rich countries and donors that were lagging behind have stepped up and pledged more funds,\" said Penny Lawrence, international director of Oxfam Great Britain. \"Yet, there's a gaping hole of nearly $1bn in funding for the emergency response, not to mention for the longer road to recovery that will require sustained international investment.</p><p>\"The clock is ticking for east Africa, and the African Union governments that are meeting next week must show their determination to make this Africa's last famine.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2011/8/18/1313664653034/MDG--FAO-international-em-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/aug/18/food-experts-solutions-somalia-famine","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2011/aug/18/food-experts-solutions-somalia-famine","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Britons in trouble abroad: find out where you're most likely to get arrested","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-05T14:05:32Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/aug/05/fco-trouble-abroad-britons","fields":{"body":"<p>The latest data from the <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=639222082#\">Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office</a> shows how British embassies and consulates have their work cut out around the globe.</p><p>The headline figure is that arrests are down by 10% - although the number needing hospital treatment increased in 2010/11 despite the fact that less of us are going abroad. </p><p>And this data doesn't just cover tourists - but also the millions of ex-pats living around the world.</p><p>British embassies and consulates are the first port of call in a crisis for many Brits - and this video from the FCO shows a typical 24 hours in the life of the overseas service.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbO-k0zJkqE\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nbO-k0zJkqE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p><strong></strong></p><p>The key figures from the report, which bring together the 19,228 calls for help  last year, show that:</p><blockquote><p>• Total arrests in the 12 months ending March 2011 reached 5,700 - a reduction on 6,439 in 2009/10 and well down on the 2008/09 total of 6,919<br />• Arrests of Britons for drugs offences overseas were 799 in 2010/11 - almost 20% down on the 2009/10 figure of 994<br />• The number who needed to go to hospital abroad in 2010/11 reached 3,752 - slightly up on the 2009/10 total of 3,689 <br />• Britons raped abroad fell from 132 in 2009/10 to 115 in 2010/11, but sexual assaults increased from 140 to 163</p></blockquote><p><strong></strong></p><p>So, where in the world are you most likely to get arrested, or worse?

mobile economic revolution","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-23T23:04:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2011/jul/24/mobile-phones-africa-microfinance-farming","fields":{"body":"<p>Earlier this month, on a short bus ride through the centre of Kampala, I decided to carry out an informal survey. Passing through the Ugandan capital's colourful and chaotic streets, I would attempt to count the signs of the use of mobile phones in evidence around me. These included phone shops and kiosks, street-corner airtime vendors and giant billboard ads, as well as people actually using their mobile phones: a girl in school uniform writing a text message as she hurried along the street, a businessman calmly making a call from the back of a motorcycle taxi swerving through heavy rush-hour traffic. Not only were half of the passengers on my bus occupied with their handsets, our driver was too, thumbing at his keypad as he ferried us to our final destination. After five minutes, I lost count and retired with a sore neck. There was more evidence here than I could put a number on.</p><p>My survey underlined a simple fact: Africa has experienced an incredible boom in mobile phone use over the past decade. In 1998, there were fewer than four million mobiles on the continent. Today, there are more than 500 million. In Uganda alone, 10 million people, or about 30% of the population, own a mobile phone, and that number is growing rapidly every year. For Ugandans, these ubiquitous devices are more than just a handy way of communicating on the fly: they are a way of life.</p><p>It may seem unlikely, given its track record in technological development, but Africa is at the centre of a mobile revolution. In the west, we have been adapting mobile phones to be more like our computers: the smartphone could be described as a PC for your pocket. In Africa, where a billion people use only 4% of the world's electricity, many cannot afford to charge a computer, let alone buy one. This has led phone users and developers to be more resourceful, and African mobiles are being used to do things that the developed world is only now beginning to pick up on.</p><p>The most dramatic example of this is mobile banking. Four years ago, in neighbouring Kenya, the mobile network Safaricom introduced a service called M-Pesa which allows users to store money on their mobiles. If you want to pay a utilities bill or send money to a friend, you simply dispatch the amount by text and the recipient converts it into cash at their local M-Pesa office. It is cheap, easy to use and, for millions of Africans unable to access a bank account or afford the hefty charges of using one, nothing short of revolutionary.</p><p>Safaricom didn't invent mobile banking: it existed previously in countries such as Norway and Japan, but on a small scale and with nothing like the seismic effect it had in Kenya. The established banks weren't happy at first – they tried to shut down M-Pesa soon after it started – but now they are getting in on the game, and it is estimated that by 2015 global mobile transactions will exceed one trillion dollars. According to California-based mobile-banking innovator Carol Realini, executive chairman of Obopay: \"Africa is the Silicon Valley of banking. The future of banking is being defined here… It's going to change the world.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-377163520\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110722Uganda/110722Uganda.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1070852909001_110722Uganda-16x9.mp4\"></source>\n      </video><p>The mobile banking phenomenon spread quickly to other countries in the developing world. Uganda's largest telecom company, MTN Uganda, created its own version, MobileMoney, in March 2009. Within a year, 600,000 Ugandans had signed up. Now, thanks to aggressive recruitment drives to win more subscribers – MTN agents trolling the streets for new customers are known as \"foot soldiers\" – the service has more than 1.6 million users.</p><p>MobileMoney outlets are everywhere in 2011: the distinctive canary-yellow buildings and kiosks that house them are dotted around not just Kampala but the greater part of the country. The MTN network reaches 85% of Uganda, and MobileMoney is available everywhere MTN has coverage. Many of the villages I travelled through, however minor or remote, had at least one tell-tale splash of yellow.</p><p>Mobile phones carry huge economic potential in undeveloped parts of Africa. A 2005 London Business School study found that for every additional 10 mobile phones per 100 people in a developing country, GDP rises by 0.5%. As well as enabling communication and the movement of money, mobile networks can also be used to spread vital information about farming and healthcare to isolated rural areas vulnerable to the effects of drought and disease.</p><p>Despite the proliferation of phones in Uganda, however, a digital divide persists. How can information be understood and properly implemented when more than a third of the country's adult population cannot read or write? And can complex and detailed information be managed by anything less than a smartphone, which is beyond the means of most Ugandans?</p><p>One intriguing solution to these problems is being tried out by the microfinance organisation Grameen Foundation. Seeking to establish a reliable means of interacting with farming communities in the Ugandan countryside, Grameen has started to lease smartphones to local farmers so that they can receive information – seasonal weather reports, planting advice, disease diagnostics, market prices – and pass it on to their neighbours. They also gather information from the farmers they register and feed it back to Grameen in Kampala, which passes it on to agricultural organisations and food programmes.</p><p>These intermediaries, known as community knowledge workers (or CKWs), are chosen for their command of English, community standing and entrepreneurial spirit as well as their technological know-how. After training CKWs to use smartphones, Grameen pays them a performance-based wage averaging at about $20 per month – via MobileMoney, obviously. Deductions are made to cover the lease arrangement and high-performing farmers can expect to fully own their phone, and the charging solution that comes with it, within two years.</p><p>So far, Grameen has trained 500 CKWs in 32 Ugandan districts, reaching more than 20,000 households, or 100,000 people. \"We're aiming for a million,\" says Sean Krepp, Grameen's Uganda director, \"and we're looking at scaling this to several other countries.\"</p><p>Before that can properly happen, the technological side of the programme needs to be developed and refined. At present, most information arrives in text form. Reports from a variety of sources, including Uganda's Department of Meteorology and its National Agricultural Advisory Services, are rewritten in clear English before being dispatched to the CKWs. Grameen has started sending images to its representatives so that, for example, a coffee plant disease can be diagnosed by visual means. The next step, according to Krepp, is video. The economist Philip Parker, in collaboration with Grameen, is currently developing a series of educational videos, presented in the style of a gameshow, to be played on CKW smartphones during village get-togethers.</p><p>There are other, more fundamental challenges. Unreliable network coverage in remote areas of Uganda is a significant problem. Keeping smartphones charged in villages that don't have electricity is another. Some ingenious solutions have been devised (see below), but low battery power remains a constant headache.</p><p>In spite of these obstacles, the programme appears to be working – and its potential for expansion, not just beyond Uganda's borders, but also into other areas, such as healthcare and education, is becoming clear. If the digital divide is being bridged in some of Africa's poorest communities, and the information is getting through, why stop at farming?</p><h2>Case study 1: a mobile money micro-economy</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-387960901'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2011/7/21/1311246012962/Africa-mobile-phone-boat--007.jpg' alt='Africa mobile phone boat owning businessman' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Boat owner Allan Mukasa uses his phone to settle bills and pay local traders. Photograph: Yousef Eldin</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Kasensero:</strong> Rakai district</p><p>The small fishing village of Kasensero on the shores of Lake Victoria is a 200km drive from Kampala, heading south-west towards the border with Tanzania. The final 40km takes you down a bumpy red-clay road, which on rainy days becomes a muddy assault course. When you finally reach the village, a road barrier blocks your way until an elderly guard deems you fit to enter and raises it up.</p><p>At the end of the main street is Africa's largest lake and the main source of the town's industry. Here, lined up along the shore, are hundreds of long, narrow fishing boats piled high with nets. The morning's catch is in when I arrive in Kasensero and the last of the giant Nile perch are being carted away towards the factory further down the beach, where they will be processed, packed and sent to Kampala for export.</p><p>At the end of the row of buildings overlooking the shore is a distinctive yellow facade: one of two MobileMoney agents in this village of 5,000 people. Inside, Ben Nsubuga, a fisherman, is depositing his weekly earnings.</p><p>He hands a wad of cash to the woman behind the desk who logs the deposit in a book and gives him a code, which he enters into his phone. A small fee is charged and within a couple of minutes the transaction is complete.</p><p>\"Before this service came here, I was keeping all my cash with me,\" he says. There are no banks nearby and in the past whenever Nsubuga travelled to bring money to his family, he feared being robbed on the long road out of Kasensero. \"Now I just send the money this way,\" he says, gesturing with his phone. The money is transferred via text and the person at the far end can cash it in at any MobileMoney agent.</p><p>The biggest problem, he says, is the network, which is patchy in these parts and often leaves customers without ready access to their hard-earned cash.</p><p>Next in line is Allan Mukasa, a boat owner and the village's vice-chairman. \"Somehow, it has made life here better,\" he says. As well as sending money long-distance, Kasensero residents bank money on their phone and transfer it among themselves, creating a kind of micro-economy in this isolated town. \"We&nbsp;also use it to pay water and electricity bills and school fees,\" Mukasa adds. But he sees plenty of room for improvement. \"Before, we didn't know how to bank. Now, we want to have a proper banking system, with the possibility of making interest.\"</p><p>It is only after I leave Kasensero that I learn about its troubled recent history. In the early 1980s, the town was the site of the world's first community-wide Aids epidemic: a fifth of its population had died of the disease by 1986. Nearly a decade later, several thousand bodies from the Rwandan genocide washed up on its shores, carried to the lake down the nearby Kagera river. A mass graveyard a few kilometres away recalls the horror.</p><p>Today, the town is putting its traumatic past behind it and, if the queues outside the yellow-fronted offices are any indication, it is prospering. Only now, Kasensero's money doesn't end up under the mattress: it hovers about in the airwaves, to be accessed or dispatched with the touch of a button and a small charge from MTN. Signal permitting, of course.</p><h2>Case study 2: farming with a smartphone</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-387960904'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2011/7/21/1311247054388/Africa-mobile-phone-Ugand-007.jpg' alt='Africa mobile phone Ugandan farmer checks crops' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Farmer Simon Obwoya, foreground, makes notes on crop conditions and checks market prices. Photograph: Yousef Eldin</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Lagude:</strong> Gulu district</p><p>Shortly after I arrive at the small cluster of mud huts that makes up the tiny village of Lagude, in northern Uganda, my host, Simon Obwoya, announces with great regret that he cannot show me his mobile phone: it was taken to Kampala for repairs two weeks ago. Without it, he is unable to access valuable information that makes farming in this difficult, drought-prone terrain more practicable.</p><p>Last December, Obwoya, who is 43 and married with eight children, was recruited as a community knowledge worker by the Grameen Foundation and trained to use a smartphone so that, as well as receiving advice about weather, plant and animal health and market prices, and dispersing it around his local area, he could gather information from the farmers he registers and send it back to Grameen.</p><p>Of all the districts that the foundation work with in Uganda, Gulu is the most problematic. For 20 years, much of northern Uganda was a war zone. Terrorised by the notorious Lord's Resistance Army, large numbers of people were forced into grim displacement camps. In the last few years, following the expulsion of the LRA in 2005, people have been slowly returning to their homes, and to normality. But two decades of conflict have taken a heavy toll – on community trust and the motivation to work as well as lives and material wealth. A wealth of farming knowledge has been lost, too, and Simon is working hard to restore that and bring it up to date.</p><p>Just before sunset, a Grameen representative arrives from Gulu town on a motorbike with Simon's HTC smartphone, fresh from the menders. Simon is delighted and immediately sets about recharging it: no mean feat in a village without electricity. As part of the lease package, Simon received a lithium-ion \"intelligent battery\" called a ReadySet, designed by American company Fenix International. It also powers an LCD lamp and a radio, but Simon's ReadySet is low on juice so he charges his phone in our van.</p><p>The next morning, Simon sets about addressing the ReadySet issue. He connects the battery to a kinetic generator, which he affixes to the rear wheel of his bicycle. Then he gets on his bike, which is held on a stand, and starts pedalling. The village has become accustomed to the spectacle of Simon cycling without moving, often for hours at a time, in an attempt to recharge his ReadySet.</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well as it should and he often has to top up the battery at the local trading station, which costs money.</p><p>Undaunted, Simon takes me on a tour of his fields, where he grows maize, cassava, groundnuts and beans, and the wider area he administers as a CKW. This encompasses five villages, and Simon has registered more than 300 farmers to the programme in the last six months.</p><p>To register, a farmer must provide exhaustive details about his farm, household and income, as well as the things he needs most to improve his livelihood. Many in the area still wonder why Grameen isn't providing them with physical aid, but Simon tells me he is working to change that mindset. \"Let someone give you knowledge, then you are rich. That's what I say to my farmers.\"</p><p>Is the knowledge he receives from Grameen actually making a difference? Simon nods. \"Especially this year. We were warned there was going to be a long drought so many of our farmers took their time before putting down their seeds. That was what happened and our farmers were able to save their seeds.\"</p><p>Simon has also founded a farming collective and now, with Grameen's help, they are bulking their produce and selling it at a good price to the World Food Programme, which will use it for relief work in the region. The CKW programme has had a rocky start in Gulu, and challenges lie ahead, but in the fields that Simon Obwoya monitors with his treasured smartphone, it is beginning to yield tangible results.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2011/7/21/1311245824122/Africa-mobile-phones-in-u-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jul/24/mobile-phones-africa-microfinance-farming","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2011/jul/24/mobile-phones-africa-microfinance-farming","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"All of our data journalism in one spreadsheet","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-20T09:33:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/jan/27/data-store-office-for-national-statistics","fields":{"body":"<p>Today we have a list of all the data journalism produced here on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/datablog\">Guardian datablog</a>. </p><p>You can see what's been popular and get easy access to the data we have curated as this list shows each datablog post's associated spreadsheets, authors, the number of comments and retweets.  </p><p>By sorting the blog posts by the number of retweets, we can see that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog+world/iraq\">Iraq War Logs</a> formed the base of our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/datablog/interactive/2010/oct/23/wikileaks-iraq-deaths-map\">most retweeted post</a>, followed by a recent post from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidmccandless\">David McCandless</a> on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/jun/03/fish-stocks-information-beautiful\">fish stocks</a>.</p><p>Sorting by comments shows that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/mar/18/japan-nuclear-power-plant-updates\">Fukushima nuclear power plant updates</a> were the subject of the greatest discussion, closely followed by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jul/16/doctor-who-villains-list\">Every Doctor Who villain since 1963</a>.</p><p>The list shows that in two years we have covered a huge range of data sets.

Federal officials have alleged that the companies behind the ads make inflated claims about their products and use deceptive means to market them.&#10;\"The take so far: at least $1 billion and counting.&#10;\"The \"1 Tip\" ads are the work of armies of \"affiliates,\" independent promoters who place them on behalf of small diet-product sellers with names such as HCG Ultra Lean Plus.

Which countries have laws against domestic violence, including marital rape? The flagship report of the UN's newest agency – UN Women – published on Wednesday, takes a close look at women's legal rights around the world.</p><p>The 2011 <a href=\"http://progress.unwomen.org/\" title=\"\">Progress of the World's Women: In Pursuit of Justice</a> report is a global survey of women's access to justice – looking both at legislation passed by governments and the steps taken (or not taken) to implement those laws. The \"paradox\" confronted by the report is that despite the recent and rapid expansion of women's legal entitlements, what is written in the statute books does not always translate into real progress on equality and justice on the ground.</p><p>The report looks at which countries have passed special legislation on women's political rights and economic opportunities and on women's reproductive health and rights. It looks at which countries have laws against domestic violence, sexual harassment and marital rape. It catalogues data on development indicators related to women, and looks country-by-country at women's participation in politics.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-376550885'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/7/6/1309949354654/Picture_14.png' alt='legal rights mapped' width='455' height='293' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Women's legal rights interactive. Click image to see the map</figcaption></figure><p>The survey pulls out the case of Rwanda as an example of progress. Rwanda has the world's highest share of women in top decision-making posts: 51% of parliamentarians and half of its supreme court judges are women. According to the report: \"The presence of women in parliament has been a pivotal factor in achieving progressive legal reform on land, marriage and inheritance.\" And beyond pushing through new legislation, the report says Rwanda's women parliamentarians have also played a crucial role in implementing these new laws – taking their male colleagues on nationwide tours to monitor the application of laws and help change attitudes on women's rights.</p><p>Some highlights from the report:</p><p>• 139 constitutions guarantee gender equality, 117 countries have equal pay laws, and 115 countries guarantee women's equal property rights<br />• globally, 53% of working women are in vulnerable employment and women are paid up to 30% less than men in some countries<br />• 125 countries outlaw domestic violence, but 127 countries do not explicitly criminalise rape within marriage <br />• around the world, 603 million women live in countries where domestic violence is not considered a crime and more than 2.6 billion live in countries where marital rape is not a criminal offence<br />• 61 countries severely restrict women's rights to abortion<br />• 50 countries have a lower legal age of marriage for women than for men<br />• Rwanda has the highest share of women in parliament (51%), followed by Sweden (45%). In the UK, only 21% of parliamentarians are women, and in the US that figure is down to 17%<br />• the first woman elected to parliament was in Finland, in 1907</p><p>Boosting the number of legislators who are women is one of the key recommendations of the report and is also a key indicator for the millennium development goal on gender equality. The UN Women report suggests using quotas to increase numbers do so. Of the 28 countries that have reached or exceeded 30% of women's representation in national parliaments, at least 23 have used quotas.</p><p>The use of quotas is an increasingly popular idea – one that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/dec/15/women-parliament-quotas-gender-development\" title=\"Glenys Kinnock\">Glenys Kinnock</a> championed on the Global development site last year. But it's not without its critics. A <a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/idspublication/quotas-add-women-and-stir\" title=\"2010 bulletin from the Institute of Development Studies\">2010 bulletin from the Institute of Development Studies</a>, for example, noted that quotas can be more about maintaining the legitimacy of a regime than about women's empowerment. And the assumption that women in parliament promote progressive politics might not hold - women can just as easily reinforce elite agendas, and quotas may disproportionately favour wealthier women.</p><p>We've pulled out some of key data from the report, which you can download <a href=\"#data\">below</a>. We've included key dates (such as when women got the right to vote, or the right to stand for election), key figures (such as numbers of women parliamentarians, rates of maternal mortality, women's unemployment and the gap between women's and men's wages) and key laws (such as those on abortion and those against domestic violence, sexual harassment, and marital rape).</p><p>What can you do with

stock-outs in Tanzania is all too familiar. As anti-malaria co-ordinator on the council of the Lindi Rural district, one of the poorest regions in the country, he has faced an uphill battle to ensure sufferers of the disease have access to drugs. </p><p>Supply chain inefficiency, a result of poor stock control and forecasting of anti-malarial drugs at all levels of government, has meant that local health facilities frequently run out of medicines, he says. </p><p>But in 2009, he was given a helping hand. Spotting an opportunity to reduce the number of stock-outs in Tanzania, Jim Barrington, the former chief information officer of Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis, launched the SMS for Life programme to monitor the levels of anti-malarial drugs at local health centres and re-distribute medicines where necessary. </p><p>In a country where there are 60,000 malaria deaths a year, 80% of which are among children under five, according to the President's Malaria Initiative - a US government programme - the availability of drugs is vital in combating a disease that is curable if treated within the first 24 hours. </p><p>\"If a child gets ill in the evening and you have to wait until the next day, there's already been a delay and if the health facility you go to doesn't have the medicine you need, you only have a few options. You can walk to another town or buy medicine if you have the money,\" says Barrington. </p><p>The premise of SMS for Life was simple but the results impressive. Leveraging its contacts, Novartis assembled a cast of public and private actors that included IBM, Vodafone, the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and the Roll Back Malaria campaign to launch a 21-week pilot project in three of Tanzania's districts to monitor drug levels. </p><p>Using mobile phones and electronic mapping technology designed by Vodafone, local health workers sent weekly text messages to district health facilities to update them on their inventories, allowing drugs to be re-distributed. </p><p>By the end of the pilot, the number of health facilities without one or more anti-malarial medicines fell to 26% from 78% in week one. In Hemedi's district, stock-outs were eliminated by week eight. The programme's success means it is now being rolled out across Tanzania and will enlarge to track drugs for leprosy and tuberculosis in September. </p><p>SMS for Life is the type of innovative public-private partnership that has bolstered the case for businesses to get involved in fighting diseases such as malaria.</p><p>\"Traditionally the UN would've said can you write a cheque or can you make certain donations but now there has been a clear acknowledgement by governments that they are not going to meet the Millennium Development Goals alone,\" says Natalie Africa, the programme manager for Business Call to Action, which aims to accelerate progress towards the MDGs by enlisting companies to develop business models that have both social and financial dividends. </p><p>Africa stresses the importance of the commercial nature of these ventures to ensure their long-term sustainability and says businesses can provide the technology, skills and innovation necessary to reach the MDGs: \"The private sector is just one component in society and not involving them would be like working with one leg.\" </p><p>Others acknowledge that corporations can leverage their distribution networks as well as project management and logistical skills to ensure products from drugs to mosquito nets arrive in hard-to-reach villages. Their large geographical footprints also mean companies usually have experience in scaling up and replicating projects.</p><p>This has certainly been the case for Standard Chartered Bank, which has a heavy presence in Africa. The bank launched its 'Nets for Life' programme in Zambia in 2006 and has since teamed up with local health ministries and other partners to distribute 6.4 million long-lasting insecticide-treated nets in 14 other African countries.</p><p>Gavin Laws, group head of corporate affairs at the bank, says it makes good business sense to tackle a disease like malaria. Absenteeism due to sickness, a slump in productivity and an increased healthcare bill for employees are all reasons for companies in infected areas to join the battle.</p><p>\"Ultimately, our business is only as strong as the communities in which we operate, so by ensuring the health of our communities, we also ensure the health – and sustainability – of our business,\" says Laws.</p><p>The bank's involvement has also added a business dimension to the 'Nets for Life' programme: Laws says that Standard Chartered ensures a robust governance structure and that \"funding is spent to bring maximum return on investment.\"</p><p>Prudence Smith, a spokeswoman on malaria for the World Health Organisation, says that while mistrust of corporate motivations meant the organisation was reluctant to collaborate with businesses for many years, it was now generally agreed that PPPs were a \"win-win\". </p><p>Smith says working with companies provides the public sector with a valuable insight into their business models: \"More and more we are realising that there's a huge amount of money to be mobilised as well as expertise, business acumen and knowledge on the ground. Their understanding of health can help us. It's a quid pro quo.\"</p><p>Barrington too speaks plainly about the motivations behind the companies involved in SMS for Life. Under the scheme, Vodafone committed to developing and supplying the software for the duration of the pilot with the understanding that it would charge commercial rates if the project was rolled out. Similarly Novartis, a major producer of anti-malarial medicines, benefits from knowing its supplies are reaching its customers in Tanzania and from potentially winning new business in other African countries.</p><p>Despite the push for greater engagement with the private sector in international health development, Sabha Sobhani, a programme manager at the United Nations Development Programme's Growing Inclusive Markets Initiative, says that corporate involvement should not be oversold. <br />\"Alone, business is not a panacea for social change,\" he says. Instead, Sobhani believes that companies need to be part of an ecosystem that includes governments and non-profits with each bringing their unique skillset to the table.</p><p>Back in Tanzania, Barrington is busy training health workers as part of SMS for Life's roll-out and is in talks to launch similar programmes in Ghana, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \"It's a project that has given me the greatest satisfaction in my whole career,\" he says.</p><h2></h2><p><strong>This feature was written for the Guardian International Development Journalism competition before 13 June 2011.</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/journalismcompetition/text-for-life","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/journalismcompetition/text-for-life","sectionName":"International Development Journalism competition"},{"webTitle":"Human trafficking: how the US state department ranks your country","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-27T18:01:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/jun/27/human-trafficking-us-state-department","fields":{"body":"<p>How bad is human trafficking around the world?

href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/index.html\">drugs and crime</a> published its <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2011/June/wdr-2011---drug-markets-stable-but-consumption-of-synthetic-and-prescription-drugs-rises.html?ref=fs1\">World Drug Report 2011</a> today. </p><p>The report names opiates such as heroin as the most damaging of the illegal drugs. The reason is because heroin users receive more treatment for their problems than other drug users.  </p><p>Afghanistan grows the bulk of the world's opium poppies. Global opium production was 7,853 metric tonnes (mt) in 2009 - Afghanistan produced just under 7,000 mt of this.  The 'knock on' effect of the global opium production is that 460-480 mt of heroin was trafficked and 375 mt are estimated to have reach consumers. <br />  <br />The UN have been 'clamping down' on Afghanistan with: <br /><ul>\n<li>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/regional/central-asia.html#pp\">Paris Pact</a></strong> which involves over 50 States and organizations cutting down the trafficking and consumption of Afghan opiates.</li>\n<li>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2009/October/triangular-cooperation-fights-drugs-and-builds-confidence-.html\">Triangular Initiative</a></strong> where UN countries share information and work together to prevent Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan from growing and selling drugs.</li>\n<li>Operation <strong><a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/centralasia/en/news/operation-tarcet-2.htm\">TARCET</a></strong> an initiative to prevent the smuggling of the substances needed to grow poppies on an industrial scale into Afghanistan. The report claims that this project has \"intercepted and seized tons of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals\".</li>\n</ul>   </p><p>The opium fields in Afghanistan have been shrinking since 2007. Either the UNs projects are working or the plant disease that affects poppies in Afghanistan is taking its toll. Or a combination of both.  </p><p>However the proportion of other countries both growing opium poppies and producing opium has been increasing. Myanmar in particular is shown to be a big grower. </p><p>Could it be that the UN intervention is simply rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic - shifting the growing of opium poppies to more remove and varied places?  </p><p>The report also covers the 'life cycle' of other drugs: from production to distribution and users. The <a href=\"#data\">table below</a> and <a href=\"http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/visualizations/global-drug-use-by-drug-type-and-c\">visualisation</a> above shows the percentage of the population using different types of drugs in 232 countries. </p><p>We have extracted more of the data from the report into a <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdDd4czhPZl9MaGJ3ZFBFSkhTcGVqeHc&amp;hl=en_US\">spreadsheet</a> for you to explore.

Pasta was closely followed by rice, pizza, chicken and meat. Junk food also made an appearance on the list with KFC coming in as a more popular answer than cod, fajitas and gnocchi. The poll includes answers such as 'Indian' and 'Chinese' as no boundaries were set for answering  to allow for cultural differences, according to Oxfam.</p><p>The breakdown of most common answers by country show the individual differences between countries, those from the UK ranked steak as their favourite food whereas the US placed pizza as their number one favourite. In comparison, Pakistani nationals favoured vegetables and Australia went for chocolate above other favourites pasta and steak. </p><p>Developing nations were the most likely to report not having access to enough food each day, especially high in Tanzinia and Kenya. The report also showed that oil and transport costs were highly attributed to affecting food supply - 41% of South Africans surveyed put this the highest above actions of big companies and consumer demand. </p><p>High food prices seemed also to be a big pressure globally, with 15 of the 17 countries, reporting this as their highest concern in choosing food. The Philippines and India however are more likely to choose food by the health impact, as 61% and 57% respectively, ranked this as their highest concern when choosing food for themselves and their family. The table for this reports total mentions rather than one answer. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-376059704'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/6/22/1308743907616/Global-favourite-foods-in-007.jpg' alt='Global favourite foods interactive' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Click <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/interactive/2011/jun/16/world-favourite-foods-map-interactive\">here for the full interactive</a> </figcaption></figure><p>In contrast, respondents in Russia chose the safety of food as their main concern. This <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/interactive/2011/jun/16/world-favourite-foods-map-interactive\">interactive</a> by Paddy Allen shows top favourite foods by country. Although it is difficult to gage global food trends with a small sample, the report does highlight some issues apparent across the world concerning the access and attitudes to foods. </p><p>The tables below show some of the responses of the report including the total favourite food list of the all countries and also some of the responses to questions asked by Oxfam concerning current food issues. The spreadsheet also includes responses to further questions used in the report.</p><p>What can you do with the data?</p><h2>Data summary</h2><table>\n      <caption>\n            'Do you have enough

You see, Michelle celebrates the full month, and I celebrate half.</p></blockquote><p>But the laughs turned to boos when Brown began targetting Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Tim Pawlenty among the Republican presidential contenders, with the conference organiser turning off the microphone and having Brown escorted from the stage.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS5aPCAd8Ho\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"292\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZS5aPCAd8Ho?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>The president of the Republican Leadership Conference, Charlie Davis, said he made the decision to take Brown off, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/44/post/obama-impersonator-makes-racial-gay-jokes-at-gop-gathering/2011/06/18/AGVLAUaH_blog.html\">telling the Washington Post</a>: \"I pulled him off the stage. I just thought he had gone too far. He was funny the first 10 or 15 minutes, but it was inappropriate, it was getting ridiculous.\"<br /><br />Organisers also blamed the abrupt finish on Brown's act over-running its alloted time slot.</p><p>The first part of Brown's act made reference to the so-called \"birther\" controversy, mentioning Obama's place of birth Hawaii \"or, as the Tea Partiers still call it, Kenya\" before venturing further into dangerous territory in comparing the president's mother to the Kardashian sisters reality TV stars:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>My father was a black man from Kenya and my mother was a white woman from Kansas. So, yes, my mother loved a black man and, no, she was not a Kardashian.</p></blockquote><p>The allusion there – apparently understood by the largely middle-aged Republican audience – is to Kim and Khloe Kardashian, who have both had relationships with high profile black athletes, with Khloe married to Lakers star Lamar Odom.</p><p>Brown's act included \"computer technology to predict what Michelle and I are going to look like at the end of my first term,\" flashing up a photograph of Redd Foxx from the 1970s sitcom <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_and_Son\">Sanford and Son</a> (the US version of the British comedy Steptoe and Son)</p><p>Scattered boos started when Brown/Obama began making fun of the various Republican presidential contenders, and was just starting on a joke about Michele Bachmann when the sound was cut and a moderator appeared to usher Brown off the stage.</p><p>How bad was Brown's act? According to <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/06/jokes-cont/240648/\">Ta-Nehisi Coates at the Atlantic</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It doesn't strike me as offensive so much as really, really, really off in every way possible. Just a lack of self-awareness all around.</p></blockquote><p>You can watch the full 20 minutes of Brown's act <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DayThr\">here</a>, starting from the 2:04 mark.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/6/20/1308587837769/reggie_brown_sm.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2011/jun/20/republicans-barack-obama-impersonator","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2011/jun/20/republicans-barack-obama-impersonator","sectionName":"US news"},{"webTitle":"UNHCR 2011 refugee statistics: full data","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-20T06:35:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/jun/20/refugee-statistics-unhcr-data","fields":{"body":"<p>The latest refugee statistics are out.</p><p>The number of people forcibly displaced worldwide has reached 43.7m people, the highest number in 15 years, according to a report published today to mark <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4bf4f2616.html\">World Refugee Day</a>. </p><p>The annual 'Global Trends' report released by the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home\">UN's High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) </a>shows a rise of internally displaced people (IDP) - up to 27.5m at the end of 2010.

There are three million Afghan refugees, one out of three of the total worldwide number. Countries facing conflict and disruption feature heavily in the report and a big trend seen is the number of refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries.<br /> <br />The UNHCR says that \"by the end of 2010, three quarters of the world's<br />refugees were residing in a country neighbouring their own\"  - neighbouring Pakistan and Iran were the refuge for over 2.7m Afghans in 2010. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>As seen in<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jun/15/refugee-statistics-unhcr\"> last years report</a>, developing countries host four fifths of the world's refugees. Pakistan, Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic are the top hosting countries globally for refugees.</p><p>So what key figures does the report bring into focus?</p><blockquote><p>•  Pakistan hosted the largest number of refugees in relation to the size of its economy with 710 refugees per $1 of GDP (PPP) per capita. The Democratic Republic of the Cong and Kenya came in second and third in the report</p><p>• 49% of persons of concern to UNHCR were women and girls. They also make up 47% of refugees</p><p>• Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia were the three major source countries of refugees in 2010</p><p>• 15,500 individual asylum applications were lodged by unaccompanied or separated children throughout 69 countries in 2010</p></blockquote><p>We have extracted the key data from the report and included some key statistics and some fascinating figures to show a glimpse of this global issue. The table below shows which countries host the most refugees and where they come from.

new generation is using social media to push for

is becoming increasingly attractive to international investors, and the growth in its human capital is also very exciting. This new generation of makers, doers, inventors, venture capitalists, bloggers, policymakers  – the \"Cheetah Generation\" as the Ghanaian economist George Ayittey has called them – are the hungry grassroots who have been let down by their governments. All they want to do is reshape the continent.</p><p>Africa has never been talked about this much and – yes – there is a reason of why a continent once perceived as problematic and unattractive is suddenly the hottest date in town. From economists, investment bankers, would-be philanthropists, well-meaning donors, and business experts, to arrogant, know-it-all people who failed the continent in front of our eyes but still deny it, more than ever, everyone is interested in our continent.</p><p>It can be amusing to see international companies discussing the attractiveness of Africa for investment and yet criticising China for being canny in its approach to investment on the continent. Despite being attracted to Africa, those same companies are not willing to make a risky investment on its soil: it will take lots of convincing for investors from emerging markets to consider putting money into grassroots developers in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda or Senegal.</p><p>China might not be the model partner for Africa based on its human rights record and transparency, but the Chinese are doing something tangible in Mozambique, Tanzania, and Ethiopia, for example, by building health centres and innovating old colonial infrastructures. They are acting in ways which Africa really needs now.</p><p>As an intellectually hungry young girl in Senegal, I was looking for ways to feed my mind with ideas and knowledge; I was passionate about my country and I had the same big dreams as every little girl in the world. At that time, the internet barely existed in the continent: I did not have access to information as I do now – everything was extremely limited and Africa was not wired. Twenty-six years later, not so much has changed.</p><p>But what is really clear is that Africa has always been a story for the west, and that social networking services of the kind we see today – such as Facebook and Twitter – did not exist when Africa's stories began to be told at international level.</p><p>Today Africans can be proud to see that – despite limited access to the internet (still a long way off for many villages  and districts) and limited freedom of expression and information, social media is revolutionising Africa. Egyptians rewrote history this year when they used social networks to bring down their president. Kenyan technology developers and bloggers are using technology to put their country on the world map; East Africa is getting connected with the arrival of fibre optics.</p><p>Africa's \"cheetahs\" are changing their continent by investing seed capital in small businesses such as agricultural programmes, or helping young women to develop small businesses, and social entrepreneurs are bringing their voices to the world stage. These changes and progress deserve more exposure, because they are key to African development.</p><p>There is a growing confidence among the African cheetahs. Social networks are talked about in villages, schools, and fast-growing cities where the middle classes are now demanding access to quick information. Africa has never had good PR, but for the first time we are witnessing a paradigm shift in narratives about the continent. Why is that?</p><p>One reason is that more transparent, user-generated content is breaking through, with websites holding  leaders to account.  Africans want to engage and tell their own stories, and they will not let anyone else write for them or tell them what to do. For the first time, Africans have a unique opportunity to do it themselves, something they have always been asking for. With access to computers, mobile devices and internet connections, free social networks can enhance power of expression on the continent.</p><p>With the new media revolutionising Africa, the time has come for Africans to blow their own trumpet and make their government accountable and for the international development community to redefine its communication strategy in Africa and become more transparent, as they now have the opportunity to engage with the Cheetah Generation.</p><p>The Cheetah Generation is just what Africa needs now: the combination of the determination of this new generation and the opportunities offered by social networks could form a great alliance that challenges African leaders and builds communities that can take action from a little tweet right to the street.</p><p>* Mariéme Jamme is co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.africagathering.org/\" title=\"\">Africa Gathering</a>.

The question now is what will happen in the next one.</p><p>The latest data, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/newsroom/docs/Outlookflyer.pdf\">out today from the OECD and the UN's FAO</a>, shows what the best estimates are of changing food prices over the next ten years. It works by looking at all the indicators, such as demand, how much we consume, how much it costs to transport the stuff and population growth.</p><p>And what it shows makes grim reading. </p><p>The key finding is that, although a good harvest will push prices down next year, the overall trend is updwards:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Over the coming decade real prices for cereals could average as much as 20% higher and those for meats as much as 30% higher, compared to 2001-10</p></blockquote><p>Although these projections are well below the peak price levels experienced in 2007-08 and again this year, this means higher food prices are becoming the norm.</p><p>So, what is happening? (<a href=\"#data\">Download the data for these charts and much more</a>)</p><h2>1. Prices are going up</h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>All across the OECD, prices are rising, and fast. According to the report, from January 2010 to 2011, three-quarters of OECD countries experienced  retail food prices increases of 5% or less, while in six they rose by over 5%. Two countries, Korea and Estonia, experienced increases of over 10%. Brazil, China, Indonesia, and the Russian Federation all had double digit rates of food inflation this past year. </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>These rates represent a significant acceleration from the previous year of single digit inflation. For those other developing and least developed countries that were examined, a similar picture of accelerating food price inflation emerged. Nonetheless, a few countries continued to experience a slowing in price increases, these include Ghana and Kenya. In Rwanda, prices actually decreased by about 2%</p></blockquote><h2>2. Consumption is going up</h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>Because of population growth and rising incomes demand for commodities will be up in developing countries. It will be stagnant in the developed west, where more food is actually eaten per person. Developing regions also have the highest per capita income growth predicted. The OECD also predicts that as part of this, people will be consuming more processed foods - and moving away from staple foods towards \"more processed and prepared food products that contain a greater proportion of animal protein\".</p><h2>3. There are no more fish in the sea</h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>The figures show that while catching fish in the oceans has stagnated, there will be a rise in aquaculture - farming fish will contribute around 45% of total fishery production by 2020. This makes fish production larger than any of the single meat categories. Over 80% of world aquaculture production is located in Asia, with China alone accounting for over 60%.</p><h2>4. The new powers will be Eastern Europe and Asia</h2><p><strong></strong></p><p>Trade in food is going to be pretty slow - growing by less than 2% as countries struggle to feed their own populations. The big countries will continue to dominate but the OECD predicts that exports of grain from the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Kazakhstan and other countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia are anticipated to grow very rapidly. It also says that higher exports from Brazil are anticipated for virtually all its main commodities. In contrast, exports from the EU will be stagnant based on slow growth in  production and a strong Euro.</p><p>There's a lot more data <a href=\"#data\">below</a>.

Fluent in five languages and adept at disguise, Mohammed had several aliases and was a central figure in extremist jihadi movements across Africa.</p><p>He also used his expertise in finance and logistics to assist al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), whose recent successes in Yemen contrast with the reverses suffered by the franchise elsewhere. Most recently Mohammed was military commander of al-Shabab (\"the youth\") a militia group vying for power in Somalia. With a $5m FBI reward for information leading to his capture, he was one of Africa's most-wanted men.</p><p>Washington had been on Mohammed's trail for 13 years, since a pair of suicide truck attacks on US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 224 people and wounded 5,000. Twelve of the dead were US embassy staff, and the rest were Africans. Mohammed planned the operations from a villa in the Runda suburb of Nairobi with his Lebanese-born ally, Wadih el-Hage. He also drove the van that guided the truck carrying the Nairobi bomb to its destination.</p><p>Mohammed tried to repeat the double-blow effect in November 2002 when his fighters attacked Paradise hotel on Lamu island, off the coast of Kenya. At the same time, other agents fired missiles at an Arkia Israeli Air passenger jet leaving Mombasa airport. The hotel attack claimed 16 lives, while the airliner apparently employed decoy devices to deflect the rockets. Had the attack succeeded, wrote Kenyan journalist Murithi Mutinga, it would have marked the largest single killing of Jews since the second world war.</p><p>Many times Mohammed was reported killed by US agents, only to reappear. Ethiopian troops eliminated one colleague in Somalia in 2007, and US forces another in Mogadishu in 2009. His eventual killing, by Somali police of the Transitional Federal Government, was due more to happenstance than calculation, after Mohammed and his colleagues took a wrong turning in their Toyota 4x4, and returned fire when ordered to stop. Mohammed was carrying a fake South African passport in the name of Daniel Robinson, a modified AK-47 rifle, a laptop and $40,000 in cash.</p><p>Born in the Comoros islands, between Mozambique and Madagascar, the man known variously as Fazul Abdullah Mohammed or Haroun Fazul was apparently radicalised at an early age, yet retained a penchant for US-style baseball caps and western technology, especially computers. He studied in Saudi Arabia, then, briefly, medicine in Pakistan, before undergoing military training at a mujahideen camp in Afghanistan in the early 1990s.</p><p>From 1993 onwards, he flourished in a Somalia that has lacked a working central government for 20 years. He often passed through the porous borders of neighbouring Kenya. Other locations for Mohammed included Pakistan, Mauritius, Yemen and Sudan.</p><p>Mohammed reputedly funded his activities with blood diamonds from west Africa. He is reported to have been present when Somali militants grounded two US military helicopters in Mogadishu and killed 19 American personnel in October 1993. The clash claimed hundreds of Somali casualties, inspired the Hollywood movie Black Hawk Down (2001) and led to US disengagement from the region.</p><p>In summer 1997 US agents seized a computer on which Mohammed expressed fears that the FBI was placing his Kenyan cell in \"100% danger\". The next year came the embassy raids, which prompted President Clinton to retaliate with attacks on southern Sudan and al-Qaida sites in Afghanistan. Mohammed left Kenya in a hurry, but by June 2000 was back in the country on Siyu island, where he acted as a charismatic Islamic preacher and benefactor.</p><p>In 2007, Mohammed was involved in the Islamic Courts movement, which briefly captured Mogadishu until US‑backed Ethiopian forces intervened. Later he sided with its al-Shabab faction, notorious for sawing off thieves' hands and extracting gold teeth. He may also have siphoned arms to al-Qaida's Yemeni offshoot across the Gulf of Aden. No evidence links Mohammed directly to 9/11. However, he probably recruited foreign fighters to Somalia.</p><p>After the death of Saleh Nabhan in November 2009, Mohammed became leader of al-Qaida in east Africa. He expressed no regrets for the loss of innocent lives, and is survived by three wives and a number of children.</p><p></p><p></p><p><em> • </em>Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, terrorist, born 25 February 1974; died 8 June 2011</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/12/fazul-abdullah-mohammed-obituary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/12/fazul-abdullah-mohammed-obituary","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Mobile health offers hope to patients in Africa | Alex Duval Smith","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-08T10:23:33Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2011/jun/08/mobile-phone-healthcare-africa","fields":{"body":"<p>Experts gathered for Africa's first <a href=\"http://www.mobilehealthsummit.com/\" title=\"Mobile Health Summit\">mobile health summit</a> on Tuesday hailed the use of phone technology as a new frontier in improving patient care in poor countries. But a government minister in South Africa, which is hosting the summit, called for caution over issues of regulation, confidentiality and cost to patients.</p><p>The debate came as the World Health Organisation released a <a href=\"http://www.who.int/goe/publications/goe_mhealth_web.pdf\" title=\"major report\">major report (pdf)</a> charting the worldwide use of mobile phone technology in healthcare. It finds that 83% out of 122 countries surveyed use mobile phone technology for services that include free emergency calls, text messaging with pill reminders and health information and transmission of tests and lab results.</p><p>Mobile health is already firmly established enough for the WHO to have set up a special unit five years ago, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/goe/en/\" title=\"the Global Observatory for e-Health\">the Global Observatory for eHealth</a>, staffed by four people in Geneva.</p><p>Its manager, Misha Kay, estimated that up to 40 African countries are using mobile health services. He said large countries with several phone operators – such as Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya – are leading the way. \"The momentum is huge. What is happening is important. Millions of people in Africa still do not have access to any healthcare. With mobile technology they can at least have some,\" he said.</p><p>The report says there are now more than 5bn live mobile phone subscriptions and that 85% of the world's population is covered by a wireless signal. In Africa, mobile penetration exceeds infrastructure development – including paved roads, and access to electricity and the internet.</p><p>The report praises an initiative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where Population Services International (PSI) supports a free hotline to complement its family planning campaigns. In Ghana, funding from a US university provides free mobile-to-mobile voice and text services between the 2,000 GPs who serve the country's 24 million population.</p><p>Elsewhere, the report singles out for praise a private hotline in Bangladesh, called HealthLine, which has taken 3.5m calls since it was set up in 2006.</p><p>The four-day Cape Town summit brings together principally mobile operators, handset manufacturers, providers of tele-medicine equipment, health insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry and government representatives.</p><p>Chris Ross, managing executive for commercial development at the British-South African Vodacom company, said healthcare would provide the next wireless breakthrough in Africa, after mobile money schemes that allow transfers between people who do not have bank accounts. \"Someone who is ill often cannot travel, but now we can reach them. Doctors, who are in short supply in Africa, can give mobile health workers all the information they require to run community health clinics.</p><p>\"The industry wants to use mobile devices to enhance the lives of our customers. That makes business sense. We can go to the likes of the pharmaceutical companies, to governments and private organisations who will fund the transactions,\" said Ross.</p><p>But the mobile health environment remains unregulated in Africa. No rules exist, for example, to stop pharmaceutical companies from giving away mobile phones to medical professionals as part of promotional campaigns.</p><p>South Africa's deputy communications minister, Obed Bapela, called for a regulatory framework: \"We view mobile health with a mixture of enthusiasm and caution,\" he said. \"We're enthusiastic that technology will help fast-track the delivery of services and reduce transport costs for poor people. At the same time, we're cautious about issues of confidentiality and the vulnerability of patients that arises around cyber security issues. We also need to look at whether the mobile operators are just looking at an opportunity to make more money. That element should be balanced against the cost to the consumer.\"</p><p>Kay called on the stakeholders in mobile health to adopt a \"more strategic approach to planning, development and evaluation to increase the impact of mHealth [mobile health] and prove that it actually works. Only 12% of respondents to our survey had done any work on the effectiveness of their efforts'.'</p><p>Ironically, the conference and the WHO's endorsement of mobile health comes just days after radiation from mobile phones was classified as a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/may/31/mobile-phone-radiation-cancer-risk\" title=\"possible cancer risk\">possible cancer risk</a> by the same body.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2011/6/8/1307526803557/MDG--Mobile-health-001.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/jun/08/mobile-phone-healthcare-africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2011/jun/08/mobile-phone-healthcare-africa","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"The rising cost of food - get the data","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-07T12:24:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/datablog/2011/jun/07/rising-cost-of-food","fields":{"body":"<p>The last monthly report on global food prices before the summer is now out. </p><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/wfs-home/en/\" title=\"a new UN report\">data from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation</a> (FAO), published Tuesday, global food prices have barely budged since April but the big picture remains bleak: the global price for a basket of basic foods is still 37% higher than it was this time last year.</p><p>High and volatile food prices are also likely to prevail for the rest of the year, and into 2012, according to the FAO's  <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/al978e/al978e00.pdf\" title=\"biannual report\">biannual report</a> on global food markets, also published on Tuesday. The UN agency warns that weather conditions - too much or too little rain - could weaken maize and wheat yields in Europe and North America, and an overall rundown on food inventories is set to tighten global supply.</p><p>Earlier this year, international food prices soared to levels last seen in 2007-08, when a global food crisis provoked riots in 30 countries. Last week, Oxfam launched a new international campaign on the global food system, warning that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/may/31/oxfam-food-prices-double-2030\" title=\"food prices could double over the next 20 years\">food prices could double over the next 20 years</a> and mark the beginning of a permanent food crisis.</p><p>The FAO food index averaged 232 points in May, down only slightly from 235 points in April when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/apr/14/food-price-inflation-world-bank-warning\" title=\"the World Bank said\">the World Bank said</a> rising food prices had pushed 44 million more people into extreme poverty, (those living on $1.25 a day).

Everyone has a favourite culprit: a growing population, a concentration of corporate control, a booming biofuels industry, China's demand for meat. Others point to the massive influx of big investors into deregulated commodities markets – searching for a \"safe bet\" after the dotcom bubble burst – who speculate on the future price of food.

The FAO adds that more must be done to improve transparency in global food markets.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/stories/rising-food-prices-10-questions-answered?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Twitter_Update&amp;utm_campaign=Food%2BPrices\" title=\"the World Food Programme\">World Food Programme</a> (WFP) has warned that current food prices could push the agency into a serious budget gap where it might need to make painful decisions - reducing rations or cutting the number of people who receive WFP food aid.</p><p>Meanwhile governments in developing countries around the world are struggling to contain food prices and fear fresh food riots. In Caribbean countries, which are increasingly dependent on imported food, governments have called on citizens to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/caribbean-governments-encourage-gardening-to-ease-reliance-on-imports-amid-soaring-food-costs/2011/06/06/AGxgg3JH_story.html\" title=\"plant more vegetable gardens\">start planting vegetable gardens</a> and buy local produce.

Some highlights:</p><blockquote><p>• In May, the FAO food price index averaged 232 points, down only slightly from 235 in April and still up 37% from last year. The slight drop in the cost of cereals and sugar was more than offset by increases in meat and dairy prices</p><p>• The index has hovered above 231 points since the beginning of 2011, and reached a historic peak of 237 points in February - higher than the average 213.5 points in 2008 and the highest level since the UN food agency began monitoring food prices in 1990</p><p>• The global cost of meat hit a record high in May, with 183 points on the FAO's meat price index</p><p>• The cost of oils and fats remained unchanged in May, at 259 points. But this is still historically high and up 52% from last year</p><p>• The overall index dropped to its lowest level in May 2002, at 85.3 points</p><p>• The cost of sugar spiked in 2006, 2010, and again in 2011. In May the sugar index fell just under 311 points, down 10% from April and 26% from January. The FAO points to the new crushing season in Brazil and larger than anticipated production in Thailand as possible explanations.</p></blockquote><p>Note: The next Food Price Index comes out after the summer recess, on 8 September.</p><p>The full data is below.

name: </strong></p><p>@alwalji</p><p><strong>In 30 words or less tell us who you work for and what you do: </strong></p><p>I lead the Innovation team at the World Bank. My challenge is to leverage innovation, knowledge, and talent from anywhere to help solve some of the hardest problems in the world.  </p><p><strong>Do you have a website / blog?</strong> </p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.worldbank.org/dmblog\">http://blogs.worldbank.org/dmblog</a>/</p><p><strong>Website you can't live without?</strong>  </p><p><a href=\"http://TED.com\">TED.com</a></p><p><strong>Hero or person who inspires you?</strong> </p><p>Nelson Mandela</p><p><strong>What have been the key milestones that you have reached in your work at The World Bank Institute, and what have you learnt as a result?</strong></p><p>Last April, through a cross-Bank effort, we adopted a new policy resulting in more than 7,000 development indicators becoming available in our data catalogue at no cost. Our information and data are not just public but searchable, downloadable in machine-readable formats (including through APIs), and re-usable. And users are coming to our data catalogue in huge numbers surpassing traffic to our World Bank homepage. We've realized our clients and our users are not the same group. For most people we're as much the Databank as the World Bank. </p><p>And what users have done with our data is no less than amazing. We ran an Apps for Development competition late last year. Developers built applications we would have never thought to create. They saw a pain-point and used our data to build their own aspirin solutions. It's not about vitamins and telling people what's good for them. It's about making ingredients available so people can develop their own remedies to their own problems. The right information available to the right people at the right time can be transformative.</p><p>The Bank's own Mapping for Results initiative complements Open Data by adding a geospatial dimension. Interactive poverty maps overlaid with information about where the Bank's projects are located and where funding flows is eye-opening at many levels. We see relationships between for example infant mortality and where we're our loans support health and water projects at the sub-national level. We've learned that maps are a very powerful story-telling tool particularly when they help visualize the relationships between very large and disparate data sets.</p><p><strong>How would you describe the changes that have taken place in the practise of development since your career started? What theoretical and practical progress has been made?</strong></p><p>Top-down models that replicate what hasn't worked for decades. Getting more efficient at doing the wrong thing is a real risk. We have to come to terms with what simply has not worked. There is plenty of data and evidence to suggest we need to re-think traditional development paradigms.</p><p>For example, the expert-led model where knowledge is highly centralized and parcelled out from the North to the South is out-dated. We are moving towards a much flatter world in which countries and people can learn from one another no matter where they sit. A key opportunity for the World Bank Group is to connect the supply and demand sides of knowledge and talent. That implies a transformation in how we see ourselves: a move from the knowledge bank to being global connector and curator of learning, knowledge, and innovation.</p><p>Institutions like the World Bank can be powerful enablers when we partner with people and institutions in the countries in which we work. But we need to listen better, be honest about what has and hasn't worked, and move from centralized, expert-led, and linear models to collaborative, open, and networked approaches that connect experts with expertise which is widely distributed. No single institution can be the global repository of knowledge. Knowledge lives everywhere and is inherently decentralized. The key is to make it easy to find and accessible when and where where it is needed. </p><p><strong>How much of this change can be attributed to technology? Does technology have an even greater role to play in the future?</strong></p><p>The most powerful technology is the technology that is most widely distributed. I still think that radio, for example, which may not be a very cutting-edge technology, is still one of the most important technologies in the developing world because it reaches people.   </p><p>One of the most interesting examples of where I have seen high-tech and low-tech coming together is   in Uganda, where a radio station is broadcasting questions like: \"Where is the worst pothole in Kampala?\" People are texting in their answers using their cell phones. The radio station then takes those answers gathered from a few hundred people and broadcasts it to hundreds of thousands of listeners.</p><p>These two technologies in particular are powerful today, not because of the tool themselves, but because of how widely penetrated they are.</p><p>60% of adult Africans now have access to a mobile phone, and it is the fastest growing region in the world in terms of penetration. The phone is moving from the ear to the hand—and so you can now share and create data around local issues. You can tell somewhere whether there are medicines in the clinic, whether teachers came to class, whether there is food in the village. There is the opportunity to access, as well as create new kinds of information.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give to those wishing to make a positive impact on the world using technology? Can entrepreneurs be both for profit, and for good?</strong></p><p>Focus on the user and start with problems that matter. Too often we're answers looking for questions. And the answer can't be the same if the question is different. Scale is ultimately about the repeatability of a solution based on a homogeneous problem. The private sector has learned the importance of listening to clients. Non-profits and public agencies struggle because the incentives of their funders and their end users are not always aligned.  But if you can create the right incentives for groups to be client or user-focused, I think you get better results. Getting something wrong because it's a really hard problem is understandable but getting something wrong because you don't listen to your users is totally avoidable. We can do better and we must do better in listening to our clients and ultimately our clients' client -- the citizen.</p><p>While I would not describe myself as a techno-determinist, I do believe in the disruptive power of technology to accelerate positive social and economic change. We've seen it now in the Middle East with social media and communications technologies and in Kenya and the Philippines with mobile banking and financial inclusion. But intent matters a great deal as technology is value neutral. When harnessed with positive intent, I believe ICTs can enable people to make enormous progress in timeframes that were previously just not possible.</p><p>Governments alone cannot meet the service delivery needs of all their people. They need partners, expertise and access to pools of capital. The private sector helps to fill this gap as commercial actors and non-commercial actors expand access to public goods and basic services to the poor. </p><p>Some of the most impactful innovations that improve the lives of poor people are coming from the poor themselves and from the private sector. Jeff Sachs has called the mobile phone the most important technology for ending poverty in the world today. I think that's right. It's not technology alone but how people adopt and adapt technology and use it as an enabler to accelerate change. </p><p><strong>What does the future hold for The World Bank Institute and yourself personally?</strong></p><p>The Bank's role is to be a catalyst. We should be focusing on creating infrastructure for others to build on and use. In the world of social enterprise and social innovation more broadly we're focused on developing platforms and networks bringing global players together to solve really important problems.</p><p>For myself, I just want to keep doing work that makes a difference in the world and plays to my strengths. I love connecting people, ideas, and technologies. My mother told me many years ago to be a hyphen. That's what I'm trying to do. </p><p><strong>And finally, what can we expect from you at the Guardian Activate Summit in London?</strong></p><p>I'm there to listen and learn as much as contribute. I look forward to meeting people and figuring out ways we can leverage them to help solve the problems I care most about.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/activate/speaker-interview-aleem-walji","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/activate/speaker-interview-aleem-walji","sectionName":"Activate"},{"webTitle":"A guide to coalition government contracts : how to get all the data","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-31T19:09:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/may/31/top-contracts-tenders-government-spending-public-money","fields":{"body":"<p>Yesterday the Guardian reported on the cost of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/may/30/coalition-bill-private-companies\">coalition government's contracts</a>, well the ones that have been published so far. </p><p>These contracts are a very welcome addition to our understanding of public spending. </p><p>Under the first year of coalition government rule the vast majority of departments reported their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/nov/19/government-spending-data\">monthly spending over £25,000</a>. </p><p>But the spending over £25,000, which listed the government suppliers and the amounts they were paid, didn't tell us very much about what was expected from those payments. </p><p>Now we have the contracts we can start to see what we should be getting from private companies for our tax money.

describe your work at Google? </strong></p><p>Fast-paced, challenging and impactful – everything that I work on is about making awesome things happen through technology.  I love it. </p><p><strong>What is the state of entrepreneurship in Africa right now? Is the internet a key driver of development there?</strong> </p><p>The state of entrepreneurship in Africa now is the same it has been since the beginning of time – vibrant, we just need to get better at getting government and policy makers to focus on creating an environment where entrepreneurs can thrive with the help of government rather than in spite of government. I think the internet is a key driver of opening up opportunities, which impacts many things, including development – I will repeat that I am not a fan of looking at technology or the internet in Africa through the lens of development – we love the internet for sake of the internet. </p><p><strong>How would you describe 21st century activism? How does political activism differ across locations and cultures in your opinion?</strong></p><p>21st century activism is different perhaps in the sense that the individual can be more present in the process especially via social media, but the underlying drivers remain the same as desire to change the status quo.   Political activism does differ because different locations and situations require different tactics.</p><p><strong>What are your long term goals for your work at Google?</strong></p><p>I want my work at Google to have a long-term impact on the tech scene in Africa, and to result in millions more Africans not just going online but having an amazing experience once they do.

Unlike <em>Colin McRae: Dirt 2</em>, there is less focus on customisation and, instead, a return to its roots as a no-nonsense, rally-racing sim. All that matters is shaving seconds off your time and reaching the finish line in one piece or, in the case of the new \"gymkhana mode\", racking up trick points and wowing the crowds. The result is a blisteringly fast, ultra-responsive and consistently challenging racer, undoubtedly, the finest game of its genre.</p><p>The career mode is spread over four seasons with dozens of unlockable race events made available by earning reputation points, whether through race position or by completing in-race bonus challenges – hitting target top speeds or finishing the course with the car intact. Following their successful application in <em>Dirt&nbsp;2</em>, \"rewinds\" thankfully also make another appearance, offering the ability to freeze and reverse time should you mistime a corner and become wrapped around a tree or take off over a precipice. Unused rewinds also earn reputation points, although hurtling round the unpredictable courses will have novices and veterans alike using their full allocation most of the time.</p><p>Added to the title's already vast array of tracks is the aforementioned gymkhana-style showpiece driving events, in which the challenge is to negotiate tricky courses while displaying specific driving techniques, such as controlled drift slides in confined spaces, jumps and 360-degree spins, all within a fixed time limit or against other drivers. The challenges provide a welcome change of pace from the frantic and exhilarating time trials, buggy races and rally cross events; however, they are also helpful for honing skills to control the car when racing at full tilt.</p><p>Ultimately, however, <em>Dirt 3</em>, like all driving titles, lives and dies by the standard of its core racing and developer Codemasters has perfected the art of creating a heart-stopping sense of speed, which is brought to life by a stunning level of detail, whether showing your windscreen wipers battling against snow and rain or with the beautifully serene backdrop of a sunset in Kenya. As an added incentive, once you've worked your way through the career mode, it also comes with a redeemable VIP code for online multiplayer, which makes for a flat-out bargain.</p><p><em>Reviewed using the Racer Pro Driving Simulator Seat (available from </em><a href=\"http://www.libertygames.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>www.libertygames.co.uk</em></a><em>) and the Logitech G27 Racing wheel (details at </em><a href=\"http://www.logitech.com/\" title=\"\"><em>www.logitech.com</em></a><em>).</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/5/25/1306322390627/dirt-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/29/dirt-3-colin-mcrae-rally-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2011/may/29/dirt-3-colin-mcrae-rally-review","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Activate London 2011: interview Joel D Selanikio","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-27T08:27:55Z","sectionId":"activate","id":"activate/speaker-interview-joel-selanikio-datadyne","fields":{"body":"<figure data-media-id='gu-image-375738085'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/4/6/1302104638770/Joel_Selaniko_140.jpg' alt='Joel Selaniko' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Name: </strong></p><p>Joel Selanikio</p><p><strong>Current location: </strong></p><p>Washington, DC and Nairobi, Kenya</p><p><strong>Twitter name: </strong></p><p>@jselanikio</p><p><strong>In 30 words or less tell us who you work for and what you do: </strong></p><p>I'm the CEO and co-founder of DataDyne, a social enterprise based in the US and Kenya that creates technology for the global health and international development community.  We're especially focuses on helping health and other organizations to get better information about the people they're serving.</p><p>I'm also a staff physician in the department of pediatrics at Georgetown University Hospital.</p><p><strong>Do you have a website / blog?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.datadyne.org/blog/3\">http://www.datadyne.org/blog/3</a></p><p><strong>Website you can't live without?</strong></p><p>There are things that I couldn't live without, but they don't include any websites. </p><p><strong>Internet hero?</strong></p><p>Steve Jobs</p><p><strong>What is the ethos of DataDyne? What drives you as an organisation?</strong></p><p>DataDyne has always been about creating technology to serve the needs of global health, and more broadly of international development.  I think what differentiates us from other technology organizations working in that space is that we are as focused on sustainable business models as we are on the programming side: we don't think it's good enough to come up with some technology that does the job but costs a million dollars – because most public health organizations won't be able to afford it.  You've got to give people technology that solves a problem, that is simple to use, and that they can afford.</p><p><strong>How do you provide sustainable, scalable solutions to developing world communities? </strong></p><p>Quick answer? Imitate Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the mobile phone companies – they're the ones that have already done it.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, most health workers in sub-Saharan Africa didn't have access to reliable communications. The majority didn't have access to a good phone line for voice communications, and the majority didn't have access to email for written communications.  Can you imagine how difficult it is to try to maintain a health system in rural Africa without adequate communications?</p><p>Fast forward to 2011: now just about every African health worker above the village level has a mobile phone and at least one webmail account.  This amounts to an enormous jump in capacity – and none of it was created by organizations that were actually trying to benefit international health workers.  In fact, none of it was created by non-profit organizations.</p><p>With the mobile phone – which may prove to be more significant in world history than the printing press – it was entirely a commercial venture focused on selling a low-cost, high-volume product to people in developing countries.  </p><p>In the case of the also-commercial email systems, the amazing thing is that the providers – Microsoft with Hotmail, Google with Gmail, and Yahoo with Yahoo Mail – weren't even thinking about sub-Saharan Africa.  They were focused on getting people in the US to use their service and look at their ads. But because they were creating web applications, all their products were immediately available to everyone, all over the planet.</p><p>The provision of reliable email to virtually every health worker in Africa, then, was an unintended consequence of the business and technology models of those American companies.</p><p>The bottom line is this: the only sustainable and broadly scaled successes at getting information technology to public health in poor countries have been commercial technologies.</p><p>For those of us with the \"social\" goal of aiding public health, it means we need to figure out how to apply the business models and the approach to scale that have been successfully used by business.</p><p><strong>How does not-for-profit status differentiate you from the likes of txteagle and others who are using mobile to help developing countries?</strong></p><p>DataDyne has always been an LLC (limited liability company): a \"for-profit\", but I've always felt that this \"for-profit\" and non-profit\" distinction is pretty nonsensical. You can have the head of a non-profit making $750,000 a year, but DataDyne and txteagle are \"for-profit\"?  </p><p>Anyone who knows anything about Nathan Eagle knows that money is not his primary driver. It's just that he recognizes, as do we, that the only widespread and sustained successes in using mobile to help developing countries have come from the \"for-profit\" sector – and we want to create more successes.</p><p><strong>What help did the UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation provide in getting DataDyne up and running? Is collaboration and partnership they key to any successful social start-up?</strong></p><p>The UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation Technology Partnership provided two key ingredients for our success: seed funding and communications support. Obviously, the funding was important, and we wouldn't have been able to do anything without that, but almost as important was their help in getting the word out about what we were creating.</p><p><strong>What are the hot issues in global health right now, and how are they being addressed?</strong></p><p>Well, of course HIV/AIDS and malaria and TB are still among the big issues that international health organizations are still fighting. Polio is close to global eradication, but the last mile is proving incredibly difficult.  I'd say that in general the global health community has made, and continues to make, tremendous progress.  From my perspective the most exciting aspect, though, is figuring out how we can bring these amazing technologies of mobile phones (really, mobile computers) and the internet to bear against these ongoing problems.</p><p>For example, no matter what health problem you are addressing you need to be able to manage people and materials, yet most health systems in the developing world have only the most rudimentary systems to track, for example, their medical supplies. </p><p>That was understandable when they didn't have any computers, but now every single person in the system – often including all the patients – is walking around with a connected pocket computer.</p><p>Those systems are just not doing very much with that yet: they mostly use those computers (i.e. their cell phones) to make voice calls and send text messages.  We want to show them how to use those computers as computers.</p><p><strong>What is you vision of how the world should be?</strong></p><p>No idea. I'm focused on how DataDyne should be, and that's a big enough job for now.</p><p><strong>And what can we expect from you at Activate London?</strong></p><p>I'm hoping that I can show people, through the example of our work, that the commercial approaches taken by Google, Facebook, and other companies, have been tremendously beneficial for global health and other causes. </p><p>Of course, by now everyone realizes the tremendous role played by Facebook in the Egyptian revolution, but commercial web tools – including Facebook – are transforming other realms as well, by providing universally-needed capacities to anyone who needs them: to communicate, to coordinate, to create maps, to collect and analyse and distribute information.  </p><p>At DataDyne, we were one of the first organizations to see how, for example, web-based software allows us to dramatically lower the barriers to using our own public health data collection software.</p><p><strong>Joel speaks at the Activate Summit on the 22nd June 2011 at Kings Place in London. <a href=\"http://j.mp/jNtFpX\">Book your place now</a></strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/activate/speaker-interview-joel-selanikio-datadyne","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/activate/speaker-interview-joel-selanikio-datadyne","sectionName":"Activate"},{"webTitle":"The UK's foreign-born population: see where people live and where they're from","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-26T12:05:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/may/26/foreign-born-uk-population","fields":{"body":"<p>Latest figures <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=2369\">from the ONS</a> show there are now 521,000 Polish-born residents of the UK - up from 75,000 in 2003.</p><p>It makes the Poles the biggest UK community by foreign nationality - and the second (after India) by country of birth.

This year has seen the world become less peaceful for the third year in a row - and highlights what it says is a continuing threat of terrorism.</p><p>It's made up of 23 indicators, ranging from a nation's level of military expenditure to its relations with neighbouring countries and the level of respect for human rights. The index has been tested against a range of potential \"drivers\" or determinants of peace—including levels of democracy and transparency, education and national wellbeing. The data comes from various sources, including the <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/\">International Institute for Strategic Studies</a>, The <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/\">World Bank</a>, various bits of the UN offices and Peace Institutes and the <a href=\"http://www.eiu.com/public/\">Economist Intelligence Unit</a>.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The index provides a unique insight into peace around the world. The 2011 data shows that:</p><blockquote><p>• Libya (143) saw the most significant drop – falling 83 places; Bahrain (123) dropped by 51 places – the second largest margin; while Egypt (73) dropped 24 places<br />• Despite the decade long War on Terror, the likelihood of terrorist attacks has increased in the past year in 29 countries<br />• Levels of military expenditure as a % of GDP are down and relations between neighbouring states have improved<br />• 40% of the world's least peaceful countries, including Sudan (151) and Somalia (153) at the bottom, are in Sub-Saharan Africa<br />• Iraq is no longer at the bottom, for the first time in five years</p></blockquote><p>Steve Killilea of the IEP says it's a dramatic year:</p><blockquote><p>Overall, the levels of global peacefulness have fallen only slightly.  However, this year some nations have had the largest-ever drop in peacefulness in the five years of the Index. These dramatic declines have been caused by conflict between citizens and their governments. This is most evident in nations affected by the Arab Spring where the likelihood of violent demonstrations, political instability and violent crime has been the main drivers of decreased peacefulness</p></blockquote><p>Intriguingly, the index also finds the monetary value of peace: they estimate that for 2010, the world could have saved $8.12tn from the cessation of violence. </p><p>Even at the most peaceful end, there have been changes. The UK was ranked 26th, up from 31st in 2010 and 49th when the GPI was first compiled in 2007. Ireland was in 11th place, compared to 15th for Germany, 36th for France and 82nd for the USA. Iceland returned to the top spot as most peaceful country in the world, after dropping in the rankings in 2009 and 2010 because of violent demonstrations linked to the collapse of its financial system. </p><p>We have the <a href=\"#data\">data going back to 2007</a> below.</p><p>It's one of a number of indicators available, such as Transparency <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/oct/26/corruption-index-2010-transparency-international\">International's Corruption Index</a> which collectively build up a qualitative picture of

loans: which country owes the most?","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/may/24/imf-loans-dominique-strauss-kahn","fields":{"body":"<p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn has hit the news for his alleged misconduct and resignation from his position as <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a> chief. Who will be Strauss-Kahn's successor and what will they be responsible for? </p><p>We can't help with the first question but we can shed some light on the last. </p><p>When a country is in such financial trouble that even the cost of getting a loan is unaffordable, then there is one last place to turn - the IMF. </p><p>To get an IMF loan, though, a country has to be a member and contribute something of its wealth regularly to the big pot of IMF funds.   </p><p>Here are <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/members.aspx\">all the members of the IMF</a> and the amount they contribute to the big pot of funds, and here are the loans by country:</p><p>The IMF will issue a loan to one of its member countries, but there are conditions. </p><p>First the country has to submit a <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/ns/search.aspx\">letter of intent</a>, specifying its economic plan to recover and repay the IMF loan. The <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/eds.htm\">executive board</a> then agree with the country the terms and conditions. </p><p>Over the years the IMF have been able to classify the types of loans countries need depending on the reasons the money is needed. For example low-income countries may borrow on relatively generous terms through one of the:</p><p><ul>\n<li><strong>Extended Credit Facility (ECF) </strong>- Financing under the ECF currently carries a zero interest rate, with a grace period of 5 and a half years, and a final maturity of 10 years.</li>\n<li> the <strong>Standby Credit Facility (SCF)</strong> - Financing under the SCF currently carries a zero interest rate, with a grace period of 4 years, and a final maturity of 8 years.</li>\n<li><strong>Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF)</strong> - ESF loans carry a zero annual interest rate until 2011, with repayments made twice a year, beginning at 5 and a half years and ending 10 years after the the loan was issued. The Fund reviews the level of interest rates for all concessional facilities every two years.</li>\n</ul></p><p>Then there are other loans for more established countries that come under one of the following categories:</p><p><ul>\n<li><strong>Stand-By Arrangements (SBA)</strong> -  The length of a SBA is typically 12-24 months, and repayment is due within 3-5 years of disbursement.  The majority of Fund assistance to middle-income countries is provided through SBAs.</li>\n<li><strong>Extended Fund Facility (EFF)</strong> - Arrangements under the EFF are longer than SBAs  usually 3 years. Repayment is due within 4-10 years from the date of disbursement.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible Credit Line (FCL)</strong> - The FCL is for crisis prevention or response purposes. The length of the FCL is one or two years (with an interim review of continued qualification after one year) and the repayment period the same as for the SBA but unlike SBA, this loan is available in a single up-front disbursement rather than phased.</li>\n<li><strong>Precautionary Credit Line (PCL)</strong> - The PCL can only be used for crisis prevention and countries with a good track record of recovery. It can have the length of between one and two years.</li>\n</ul></p><p>The greatest amount currently on loan is to Mexico, and then Greece. But when you look at the loan as a percentage of GDP, Liberia then Iceland are the highest with 8.5% and 7.4% respectively. </p><p>The greatest amount to be paid back per member of the population is Iceland ($2,828.67 per person) and Ireland ($2,619.14 per person). These figures do not take into account the length of the repayment, so comparisons between countries are purely on an amount borrowed basis. We have included the repayment time in the descriptions of the loans for further analysis.</p><p>Britain negotiated an IMF loan in 1976 and, depending on how well our economic recovery plan works out, we might be looking to the IMF again in the future.</p><p>What can you do with the data - or what else would you like to see us do with it?</p><h2>Data summary</h2><table>\n      <caption>\n

put to good use in Africa | Madeleine Bunting","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-19T10:44:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/19/crowdsourcing-good-use-in-africa","fields":{"body":"<p>Back in 2008, a group of bloggers based in Kenya came up with an idea in response to the wave of ethnic violence sweeping the country in the wake of elections: <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"Ushahidi\">Ushahidi</a>  – meaning testimony in Swahili – aimed to use crowdsourcing to track a fast-moving crisis. Since then, the open source platform has been deployed 12,000 times across the globe, from earthquakes in Haiti, New Zealand and Australia to the tsunami in Japan this year. Now it is preparing to launch next week its next big venture, Huduma, which will use crowdsourcing in Kenya to monitor the effectiveness of services such as health and education.</p><p>The idea behind Huduma (the Swahili word for service) is that people can send – by text, email or Twitter – reports on the performance of services in their district, explains <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/speakers/erik_hersman.html\" title=\"Erik Hersman\">Erik Hersman</a>, one of the founders of Ushahidi. This will then be mapped on the Huduma site and the responsible authority will be identified.</p><p>\"There will be a dashboard which will compare one district with another,\" he says. \"We will also layer in other information such as aid flows from, say, the World Bank. So, for example, if you pull up the profile of a school or clinic, you will have information about what aid it may have received as well as local reports on whether the teachers are turning up to work.\"</p><p>The project has been six months in development for a trial in Kenya, but Hersman is impatient; it hasn't been set up quick enough – and what has held it up has been the slow response from the Kenyan government on providing the crucial basic information, such as where schools are.</p><p>\"It turns out that USAid helped the Kenyan ministry of education to map all the schools in 2007, but this was never made public,\" says Hersman, explaining that there are real concerns about this kind of data because if you map school locations on to census information, there are anomalies such as districts with the same populations and vastly different numbers of schools. What Kenya needs is freedom of information legislation, he adds, because information on government services will show evidence of corruption and inefficiencies. He suggests that aid donors could help put pressure on governments to sign up to freedom of information.</p><p>Ushahidi's new project is already attracting considerable interest from donors, who see its potential to track aid to ensure it is reaching the right places. It also has powerful backers among reformers within the Kenyan government, who see its use in improving services across the country and tackling governance issues. Other countries, in particular Nigeria, are keen to use the platform as soon as possible. All Ushahidi's tools are open source, which is how an idea launched by a small team based in Nairobi has gone global.</p><p>\"Huduma will start in five constituencies spread across different areas of Kenya, and initially it will cover only two categories – health and education,\" says Hersman. \"Later it will expand to infrastructure, governance and water. We're starting small to see what kind of information comes in.\"</p><p>But the key to Huduma's success, he argues, is the strength of the partnerships with civil society organisations on the ground, which will be able to promote the project and encourage members to participate. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/01/citizens-make-development-happen\" title=\"Twaweza\">Twaweza</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aucharter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=95&amp;Itemid=58\" title=\"Sodnet\">Sodnet</a> are both partners and have been involved in the marketing through radio and newspapers ahead of the launch. Hersman's expertise is in technology, and Ushahidi's mission is to create the right digital tools for crowdsourcing – but he is emphatic that technology ultimately is only a tool, and relies on how people use it to be effective. It often depends on pre-existing relationships and organisations – and most important, trust – to work. Hersman calls this digital's \"analogue shadow\".</p><p>He explains this by pointing to the origins of Ushahidi: \"A few of us in Africa knew each other as bloggers, and we met for the first time in Arusha, Tanzania, in 2007. And that meeting, face to face, was probably crucial to us deciding to work together to found Ushahidi in 2008. The technology of social networking allows you to build a bridge but until you make an analogue connection, it doesn't stick.\"</p><p>So he has a warning for those who see Ushahidi's crowdsourcing technology as a silver bullet: \"A tool is only as good as the people who use it.\"</p><p>Having said that, Hersman believes technology is transforming Africa at a pace that no one ever predicted. The exponential growth of the internet connectivity across the continent offers huge opportunities for wealth creation, he suggests. But so far the bulk of Ushahidi's work in Africa has been around governance issues. In 2010, Ushahidi was used for the first time in a systematic way in votes – a <a href=\"http://www.uchaguzi.co.ke/\" title=\"referendum in Kenya\">referendum in Kenya</a> and an <a href=\"http://www.uchaguzi.or.tz/\" title=\"election in Tanzania\">election in Tanzania</a>.</p><p>\"We had reports coming in from all over the country, even from far-flung rural areas in Tanzania and Kenya. In Tanzania, we had so many reports coming in, our team of 50 volunteers couldn't process them fast enough. We had the official election monitoring teams – 550 of them in Kenya – sending in reports and we knew their information was going to be reliable. The digital and the traditional election monitoring systems were working in tandem. Any interesting reports were escalated up to the electoral commission.\"</p><p>Ushahidi has been used widely in elections in Latin America as well as India, but the initial efforts are now becoming more thorough and effective.</p><p>The area where Ushahidi made its name was in crisis response. Hersman still can't quite understand why one of the big humanitarian organisations such as the Red Cross never came up with the idea of crowdsourcing information for those critical early stages in a crisis when information is so important. He points out that there is now a toolbox of technology for humanitarian crises, such as <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" title=\"OpenStreetMap\">OpenStreetMap</a> and <a href=\"http://japan.person-finder.appspot.com/?lang=en\" title=\"Google Person Finder\">Google Person Finder</a>.</p><p>What's still needed is agreement with mobile phone operators to help people find the services they need in a crisis; in the first days after the Haiti earthquake, Ushahidi's operation was badly delayed by difficult negotiations with the main mobile operators as it tried to persuade them to text their users with details of Ushahidi's deployment. \"Ushahidi is a digital extension of the Red Cross,\" points out Hersman.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/19/1305801652595/Ushahidi-Haiti-map-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/19/crowdsourcing-good-use-in-africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/19/crowdsourcing-good-use-in-africa","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Could Huawei take on Apple?","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-11T15:00:59Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2011/may/11/huawei-apple-iphone-smartphone","fields":{"body":"<p>Ever heard of Huawei – pronounced \"hu-wa-way\"? Quite possibly not. But the Chinese company (whose formal name is Huawei Technologies) is making an aggressive push into the consumer electronics space, marketing its new smartphones and tablet PCs in glitzy Beijing malls and even a Milan fashion show as it seeks to emerge from decades of obscurity.</p><p>Huawei is betting on the Google Android operating system for its smartphones, aiming to grab market share from Apple's iPhone and Samsung Electronics' Galaxy range, in a move that is pushing the private company to open its once closed doors to the outside technology world.</p><p>After repeated requests, Huawei recently granted Reuters corespondents rare access to a research &amp; development centre in China's electronics boom town of Shenzhen, putting on display its new approach and its entry into the consumer space.</p><p>They found the building dotted with evidence of Huawei's drive for innovation: on one floor, the R&amp;D team displayed an array of products still in the works – a 4G network card, a smartphone with a wireless charger and a snazzy smartphone with a see-through case.</p><p>Having built itself into the world's second-biggest network equipment provider (after Sweden's Ericsson), having passed Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia Siemens Networks. It plans to nearly quadruple revenues to $100bn (£60.8bn) in 10 years, analysts are banking that Huawei is up to its newest consumer market challenge.</p><p>\"I cannot predict if Huawei has the makings to be Asia's next Samsung, but I would definitely not count it out,\" said Matt Walker, principal analyst at research firm Ovum.</p><p>Huawei now hopes to double its cell phone shipments to 60m this year, including 15m smartphones. \"We hope to become the world's No 3 in cell phone shipments and the world's No 5 in terms of revenues within five years,\" Victor Xu, chief marketing officer of Huawei Devices, said as he played around with a Huawei IDEOS smartphone.</p><p>Under Huawei's previous direction, consumers weren't \"able to see our brand on the things we make,\" Xu added, occasionally slipping into his pocket to grab his personal phone – an iPhone – when it rang. \"But now we're changing our strategy.\"</p><p>Yet some questions linger over Huawei among western strategists: principally, can a company so closely tied to China and its government be completely trusted? The US government has vetoed the use of Huawei equipment in some sensitive systems, especially telecoms systems, and in February forced it to reverse out of the $2m acquisition of a US startup company, server technology business 3Leaf Technologies. Similarly, in February 2008 its bid to buy network equipment company 3Com <a href=\"href=%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.businessweek.com/blogs/eyeonasia/archives/2008/02/huaweis_3com_deal_flops.html\" title=\"stalled\">stalled</a> in the face of US political opposition.</p><p>Chief of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, 66, is a former director of the telecoms research arm of China's People's Liberation Army (from 1979 to 1983). He set the company up 24 years ago with just 21,000 yuan (£1,970 at current conversion rates; probably less then).</p><p>The company is aware of these tensions; so much so that <a href=\"http://www.cio.com/article/679782/China_s_Huawei_Reveals_Board_Members_to_Boost_Transparency\" title=\"in April it revealed\">in April it revealed</a> its board members and overseas sales figures for the first time. Looking at the biographies, you wouldn't find any obvious links with the Chinese military or government – and certainly not on its chairwoman, Sun Yafang, who joined the company in 1989. That's odd, given that Chinese news reports suggest she once worked in China's Ministry of State Security. IDG News noted this; Huawei never responded to its query about the apparent omission.</p><p>Instead, the company is trying to be – or appear – more open, with moves such as giving Reuters exclusive access to its R&amp;D centre. The corridor walls had rows of paper with hand-drawn sketches of mobile phone and tablet PC designs. Just around the corner was an unusual 3D printer spewing out plaster-like handset models for the R&amp;D staff to have a look-and-feel of their designs.</p><p>Visitors and staff at the centre are barred from carrying cameras and flash memory cards to ensure new designs are kept under wraps.</p><p>\"I've noticed a lot of interesting innovations going on in Huawei,\" said Hagen Fendler, chief design director of handsets, who moved from Germany last year to join Huawei after working for Siemens. \"Twenty years ago, virtually no one has heard of Korea's LG Electronics in Europe, but now it's a big brand. I think Huawei will be able to achieve the same in China,\" he said. Fendler is one of many foreign R&amp;D staff Huawei has hired globally to strengthen its technology and designs.</p><p>While Huawei's network equipment has had success globally, one destination remains elusive – the US. It hopes smartphones and tablet PCs will help it capture that market.</p><p>With its network gear business plateauing in some markets, such as China, Huawei hopes to cash in on fast-growing mobile devices. Selling at about 1,500 yuan, Huawei's smartphones have been sold in markets from Australia to Kenya.</p><p>Global smartphone shipments exceeded PC shipments for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2010, with the mobile phone market expanding to $341.4bn by 2015 and smartphone sales contributing to three-quarters of that, industry figures showed.</p><p>Setting up its own marketing channels instead of relying on distributors is another area Huawei has to work on.</p><p>\"Huawei needs to create a brand that consumers can identify with and it will need its own marketing channels instead of relying just on distributors. From what we see, distributors aren't that keen on selling Huawei's handsets,\" said Ji Yongqing, author of the Chinese-language book \"Huawei's World\".</p><p>Huawei's spectacular growth and global standing have boosted its profile, but its ambitious overseas expansion plans have previously hit roadblocks over those suspicions that the company maintains links with China's military – ones which are almost impossible to disprove without making all the code for its equipment open source, which could undermine its business model.</p><p>In the latest edition of Fortune magazine, Ren was ranked the fifth most powerful businessman in Asia, just behind Samsung Group's chairman Lee Kun-hee.</p><p>Underscoring the company's transitive phase, a source says that Ren, a former member of the People's Liberation Army, owns two phones – one Huawei; the other, an Apple iPhone 4.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/gallery/2011/5/11/1305125854367/Ren-Zhengfei-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/11/huawei-apple-iphone-smartphone","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2011/may/11/huawei-apple-iphone-smartphone","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"The world's most dangerous roads - get the data","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-11T13:34:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/11/most-dangerous-roads","fields":{"body":"<p>The UN launches on Wednesday its \"decade for action\" on road safety to cut the 1.3 million deaths on the road each year.</p><p>According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), road traffic accidents kill more people around the world than malaria, and are the leading cause of death for young people aged five to 29 – especially in developing countries. Each year up to 50 million people are injured in traffic accidents, globally.</p><p>\"Road traffic crashes are <a href=\"http://www.who.int/entity/roadsafety/decade_of_action/dg_video_message_en.pdf\" title=\"a public health and development crisis\">a public health and development crisis</a>,\"  says WHO director general Margaret Chan. \"Every day, road traffic crashes claim nearly 3,500 lives and injure many thousands more. The vast majority of those affected are young people in developing countries.\"</p><p>The economic consequences are also significant: According to the WHO, car crashes cost the world more than $500bn each year. And the WHO warns that accidents on the road are also a leading cause of disability worldwide.</p><p>In advance of the summit on the millennium development goals (MDGs) in New York last September, campaigners argued that the figures on road deaths worldwide should serve as a \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/13/road-deaths-schoolchildren-poor-nations\" title=\"global wake-up call\">global wake-up call</a>\". But while traffic accidents are dramatic, road safety is not seen as the most pressing development issue. Through its decade for action, the UN aims to change that, hoping to aggressively mobilise interest and action around improving the world's roads. By 2020, the UN hopes to have reduced road deaths by 50%.</p><p>So where are the world's most dangerous roads? Which countries are hardest hit? To mark the launch of the UN decade, we've pulled out the most recent data on traffic deaths and injuries, from the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2009/en/\" title=\"2009 Global status report on road safety\">2009 Global status report on road safety</a>. We've included both the data on the reported number of traffic deaths per country and the WHO's estimates of what the actual numbers are (the WHO is currently updating its figures).</p><p><strong>Some highlights from the data:</strong></p><p>• while low and middle-income countries are home to less than 50% of the world's registered vehicles, 90% of the world's road traffic deaths occur in developing countries</p><p>• India has the highest absolute number of recorded road deaths (105,725), followed by China (96,611), the US (42,642) and Russia (35,972). In comparison, the UK has 3,298 recorded road deaths</p><p>• when you look at recorded road deaths proportional to a country's population, the Cook Islands comes out on top (45.0 road deaths per 100,000 people), followed by Libya (34.7), South Africa (33.2) and Iran (32.2)</p><p>• according to WHO estimates, Eritrea is home to the highest concentration of road deaths (48.4 per 100,000 people), followed by the Cook Islands, Egypt and Libya.</p><p>Note: The WHO is set to release updated data on road traffic accidents around the world in 2012. It will also add new statistics, such as the number of people who arrive at hospitals via ambulance, and the number of people who suffer disabilities after traffic accidents.</p><p>The full data is below.

class=\"timestamp\">9.27am:</span> <br />As you doubtless know by now, Osama bin Laden is dead, killed by US special forces during a raid on a heavily fortified villa in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad.</p><p>A quick summary of what we have been told so far:</p><p>• President Obama authorised the raid. In a statement to the US, he said: \"A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.\"</p><p>• His body was buried at sea yesterday, \"in accordance with Islamic law and traditions\".</p><p>• Details are beginning to emerge about the compound where Bin Laden was killed.

Yet Savage cannot help but feel that there must be some reason why it took the president so long to come clean with the American people and that he may still be hiding something from us.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>His passport records, where are they? Where are you kindergarten records? Where are your Punahou school records, Occidental college records, Columbia University records, Columbia thesis; what was it about? How about your Harvard Law School records, Harvard Law Review articles, your University of Chicago articles, your Illinois State Bar Association records, your Illinois state senate records and schedules, your medical records, the marriage licence for your mum and dad; Obama and Dunham, the divorce documents for Obama and Dunham and the Soetoro Dunham marriage licence and adoption records for your second dad, where are they?</p></blockquote><p>Savage believes that there must be some reason why the president has not released all of these documents and why the mainstream media are not demanding to see them. It is, as he says later in the broadcast, as if the president is not actually a real person but \"was invented by a textbook company\". Meanwhile, as Savage waits for the president to fully account for his existence, he continues to wonder why he bothered to release the birth certificate at all as it is just perpetuating the silliness that he claims to abhor.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>He's saying we don't have time for this kind of silliness, then why is he feeding the silliness? Why is he feeding the silliness? There's something wrong with this picture. The whole picture is crazy. But before we go into this issue – is it a true certificate, is it a false certificate, is it <em>the</em> certificate, did they make up the certificate, did they create it in the passport office – I'm telling you the issue is really bigger than where he was born. The issue is how big a failure he is as a president!</p></blockquote><p>Anyway, as the president has forced this non-issue upon the American public, Savage has no choice but to devote yet another entire show to discussing it, so he proceeds to field calls from sceptical listeners who are <a href=\"http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/barack-obama/birth-obama-certer-movement-098513\">convinced that the so-called birth certificate</a> is a fraud. Savage does not agree with all of the issues they raised, such as whether or not there was some kind of foul play involved in the fact that the doctor who signed the certificate is conveniently unavailable to verify it (he died 8 years ago), or that the president's actual father was Barry Soetoro and not Barack Hussein Obama. But other possible discrepancies such as whether the watermark on the paper and the seamless curvature where the document should have been bound are as they should be, or if the politically correct crowd would have tolerated anyone being listed as \"African\" on a birth certificate in 1961, or whether the name would have been recorded as Barack Hussein Obama Jr and not Barack Hussein Obama II did seem to Savage like legitimate questions.</p><p>Anyway, the real issue is not whether the birth certificate is authentic or not authentic, but that none of this hoopla would have been necessary if the American people simply trusted their president.</p><h2>Laura Ingraham</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-374101052'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2010/11/19/lauraingraham_140x140.jpg' alt='Laura Ingraham byline' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Laura Ingraham sees the whole birther episode as a major win for Donald Trump, because he has demonstrated the sort of leadership skills that would make him excellent presidential material (<a href=\"http://fetch.noxsolutions.com/laura/mp3/042711_trump.mp3\">listen to clip</a>). All sorts of people have been demanding to see the birth certificate for years, but it was not until Donald Trump stepped in that the document was actually produced and Ingraham thinks the negotiating skills that Trump has displayed will serve him well in future meetings with, for example, the Chinese.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm sitting across from the Chinese, I say OK Chicoms, I want to see evidence that you're cracking down on counterfeiting of American goods. I want to see evidence that you're really cracking down on anti-dumping. I want to see evidence of the fact you are not stealing our microcomputing technology. I want to see evidence of the fact that you are actually doing something to improve your abhorrent record on civil rights … and just maybe, since Trump could get results from the Obama administration on the birther issue, he could get results from China. \"Trump Gets Results!\" That's it - the bumper sticker!</p></blockquote><p>Having a president who will be able to get results has become all the more important since the budget debacle when it became clear that the House Republicans, on whom conservatives have pinned all their hopes of turning the country around, are a disappointing bunch of compromisers who are unable to dictate the terms of the debate and who have failed to live up to their campaign promises to make savage cuts in services to the poor and to cut off all funding for things like healthcare for women and the elderly.</p><p>Anyway, back to the birth certificate, Ingraham goes through it with a fine-toothed comb and certain things jump out at her, like the mother not having a job and being only 18 at the time of the birth and the father's race being listed as \"African\". She's also curious if it is actually the long form, as it only states that it's a \"certificate of live birth\", but she is gracious enough to take the president's word for it because she knows few others will.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>How long before the conspiracy theorists start questioning the bond of the paper and the watermark on the paper? Well the Y was slightly elevated in \"Kenya\" and that could lead one to speculate that this was a post hoc forgery of this document. What? No, it looks fine to me.

Any other Republican politician who had played this birth certificate thing the way Trump's been playing it, the release of the long-form today would have ended them. With Trump, he turns it into a resume builder and a resume enhancement. It's just an illustration of the … [sigh] How can I say this? You might want to say it's an add-on, you might want to say it's an albatross, but this is the showmanship characteristic that Trump brings.</p></blockquote><p>Some of Limbaugh's own listeners are not so convinced, however, that the birther debate will serve Republicans well, come election time, and rumours are starting to fester that Trump (whose political adviser <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-political-pit-bull-meet-michael-cohen/story?id=13386747\">Michael Cohen was an Obama supporter</a>) is actually a Democrat in disguise, thrown into the ring to destroy the Republican primaries.

Enrolment in pre-primary, secondary and tertiary education has also grown by more than 60% during the same period.\"</p><p>Published by the UN agency's Montreal-based <a href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/ev.php?ID=2867_201&amp;ID2=DO_TOPIC\">Institute for Statistics</a>, the report details government spending on education in each of the 45 sub-Saharan African countries. It presents the most up-to-date data on how much is spent on different levels of education, and digs out historical data to track trends over the last 10 years. The report also presents figures on the qualifications and salaries of teachers, the running costs of schools, and the provision of textbooks.</p><p>Some key findings are:</p><blockquote><p>• In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/burundi\">Burundi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mozambique\">Mozambique</a>, education spending rose by an average of 12% annually over the last decade</p><p>• Out of the 26 countries with comprehensive data, only one – the Central African Republic – reduced education spending since 2000</p><p>• Overall, sub-Saharan Africa spends 5% of its gross domestic product on education, which is second only to North America and Europe at 5.3% but in one-third of the region's countries, half of all children still do not complete primary education</p><p>• A total of 32 million children remain out of school</p><p>• In some countries, such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/guinea\">Guinea</a>, Mali, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/rwanda\">Rwanda</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/zambia\">Zambia</a>, development aid accounts for about 50% of government education budgets. But in the region as a whole, aid accounts for a much smaller fraction (5.6%)</p></blockquote><p>Wedged between the recent economic crises and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/24/africa-billion-population-un-report\">looming population growth</a>, most African governments will need to make strategic decisions on how to budget for education, says <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/\">Unesco</a>. The population of sub-Saharan Africa's five to 14-year-olds is expected to grow by more than 34% over the next 20 years, and the region will need to respond to the demands of 77 million new students.</p><p>And as neither domestic resources nor donor funding are likely to increase rapidly enough over the coming years, governments will need to make difficult decisions. If you had limited resources, which would you fund first: Primary or secondary schools? Textbooks or teacher salaries? And what do you care more about, expanding access or improving the quality of education?</p><p>Currently, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa spend at least 10 times more on a university student than on a primary school pupil, says the report. And on average, eight out of every $10 spent on university education in Africa is subsidised by country governments. These figures raise \"a serious question of equity\".</p><p>\"Should a country that cannot provide every child with a primary education cover almost 80% of the costs for tertiary students, who tend to come from wealthier backgrounds?\" asks Unesco. \"By shifting more resources to lower levels of education, governments might stimulate more household spending for higher education, without threatening the growth of the tertiary sector.\"</p><p>Unesco highlights the recent experience of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/burundi\">Burundi</a>, which brought the number of out-of-school children down from 723,000 in 1999  to just 10,000 in 2009. Over the same period, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/burundi\">Burundi</a> increased its investment in education from 3.2% of GDP to 8.3%. But what made the real difference, says the report, was the decision to dedicate a much larger chunk of the budget to primary education, effectively moving public money away from secondary schools and universities.</p><p>Below, we've pulled out some of the figures from the report, looking at public investments across the different levels of education.

to electricity.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://portablelight.org/\">Portable Light Project</a>, a non-profit initiative led by Kennedy &amp; Violich Architecture and Global Solar Energy, in the United States, inserts tiny solar cells into shirts, woven items and bags produced by remote communities in developing countries. The project aims to integrate clean energy and lighting with indigenous textile production. This helps local communities adopt the new technology and add value to it through their own work.</p><p>The project provides kits — containing a thin, two watt solar film, rechargeable battery, USB port, and an LED light — and training on how to weave them into garments.</p><p>Integration with the textiles allows the batteries and devices such as mobile phones to be charged on the move, as people go about their daily work, and LED lights enable communities to work and study after dark. </p><p>\"You simply put it [the textile with solar cells] out in the sun for about three hours. It harvests the sunlight and turns it into electricity. Then you can use it for up to seven hours,\" Sheila Kennedy, the Boston-based architect who leads the project, told SciDev.Net.</p><p>Pilot projects are underway in Brazil, Kenya, Haiti, Nicaragua, Madagascar, Mexico and South Africa, in collaboration with local non-governmental organisations (NGOs). For example, in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico the nomadic Huichol people charge solar lanterns during the day and use them to light their houses at night, which allows them to engage in artisanal cottage industries and later sell their products in towns.</p><p>The Nicaraguan NGO Paso Pacifico helps the project provide electricity to two villages. \"Now children can study in the evening and women can carry out household work safely,\" Sarah Otterstrom, Paso Pacifico's director, told SciDev.Net.</p><p>Otterstrom said people in the village no longer need to buy diesel or batteries to light their houses. \"Now they are asking for more lights,\" she added.</p><p>Kennedy said they have half the carbon footprint of normal solar cells during production, and are smaller, lighter and more resilient.</p><p>Although there is still no economic model for mass production to meet global electricity needs for remote communities, the estimated price of US$16 per item can be paid off in a year via microloans, according to Kennedy.</p><p>Brazilian sociologist Paulo Martins, who studies the social impacts of nanotechnology, told SciDev.Net that integrating textiles with solar energy is a global trend. \"We need to keep it available at affordable costs to the ones who really need it,\" he said.</p><p>This is a good example of targeting science to local needs, he added. \"[In Brazil] we invest huge amounts of money in technologies that can make our country a major player in global markets … But we constantly forget to develop science in a way that suits our true social needs.\"</p><p>Frederik Krebs of the Risø National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy in Denmark, who designed <a href=\"http://www.scidev.net/en/news/low-cost-solar-solution-could-empower-off-grid-poor.html\">a low-cost, plastic solar lamp for Africa</a>, expressed caution. \"All our studies indicate that a high degree of ruggedness is needed before it [portable solar lights] can help people in developing regions,\" he said. In his opinion, such garments are \"simply not wearable enough yet.\"</p><p>However, Harish Hande, head of India's SELCO Solar — a social enterprise taking sustainable power to households and businesses that tested Portable Lights garments — praised their portability, flexibility and light quality. But he said while it can help power off-grid communities it is not a complete solution in itself.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/1/26/1296048252443/Win-a-trip-sunshine-trail-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/26/solar-textiles-remote-villages","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/26/solar-textiles-remote-villages","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Letters: Bill to shake up export finance","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-25T23:05:00Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2011/apr/26/shake-up-export-finance-bill","fields":{"body":"<p>Tomorrow MPs will be asked to back a bill to radically shake up the <a href=\"http://www.ecgd.gov.uk/\" title=\"Export Credits Guarantee Department\">Export Credits Guarantee Department</a>. Since 1919 this little-known government department has used taxpayers' money to insure high-risk exports by private companies, today frequently to the developing world. Despite its low profile, the ECGD has far-reaching influence: in 2009-10 it backed business to the tune of £2.2bn, and the department now lies at the heart of the government's export growth strategy.</p><p>The problem is this department has a history of supporting highly controversial projects.

But this will require fundamental reform.

Get the full data","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-25T08:00:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/datablog/2011/apr/25/world-malaria-day-data","fields":{"body":"<p>April 25 is <a href=\"http://www.worldmalariaday.org/\">World Malaria Day</a>.</p><p>A disease that has affected the world and its people since the beginning of recorded human history, malaria remains an entrenched global health challenge. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/annual/malaria/en/index.html\">approximately half of the world's population is at risk</a>.</p><p>But the global geography of malaria is increasingly disproportionate. The vast majority of malaria cases and malaria-related deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, which the director-general of the WHO, Margaret Chan, has called \"<a href=\"http://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2010/malaria_report_20101214/en/index.html\">the heartland of malaria</a>.\" Meanwhile, \"outside Africa, the malaria map is shrinking, as more and more countries eliminate malaria from their territory,\" says Chan. </p><p>Malaria's victims are also disproportionately children: the United Nations children's fund (Unicef) estimates that <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_55740.html\">85 percent of those who die from malaria are children under 5 years of age</a>.</p><p>So which countries are hardest hit? </p><p>Data on malaria is notoriously patchy. The WHO only began commissioning annual reports on the state of malaria in 2008, when <a href=\"http://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2010/malaria_report_20101214/en/index.html\">Chan made data collection a priority</a>: \"To maintain momentum, results must be measured.\" </p><p>But because most of the world's malaria deaths occur at home, in private clinics, or in informal health centres, data from government records dramatically under-reports the human cost of the disease. </p><p>According to Richard Cibulskis, co-ordinator of the WHO's global malaria programme, over 90% of the world's malaria cases are likely to go unreported. \"One of the issues is that the data systems are weakest in the places where malaria is the most common,\" says Cibulskis. \"For some countries in Africa, we don't have any good data at all.\"</p><p>While only 117,704 malaria deaths were officially reported in government records for 2009, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/worldmalariareport2010.pdf\">the WHO estimates that closer to 800,000 people died of the disease that year</a>.</p><p>Epidemiologists are currently hard at work preparing the next round of country-by-country estimates – a process that is long, controversial, and often heavily politicised. Some countries would prefer inflated malaria figures, while others would rather underplay the impact of the disease.</p><p>In the meantime, to mark Monday's focus on malaria, we've pulled out what we can from the most recent data – that in the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/entity/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/worldmalariareport2010.pdf\">2010 World Malaria Report</a> (pdf), released last December. The report provides estimates for the world's 106 malaria-endemic countries and highlights progress – and shortcomings – on key international targets.</p><p>Overall, the report lauds the recent \"massive scale-up\" in malaria-control programmes – including the distribution of mosquito nets. But it also says that 2009 saw at least three African countries – Rwanda, São Tome and Principe, and Zambia – witnessed a resurgence in malaria cases, demonstrating what the report called the \"fragility of malaria control\".</p><p>Some highlights from the data:<br /><ul>\n<li>Worldwide, there were 236,863,095 suspected malaria cases in 2009, nearly half of which – 111,095,796 – were recorded in south-east Asia<br /></li>\n<li>Meanwhile, there were 81,735,305 \"probable and confirmed\" malaria cases in 2009, the vast majority of which – 68,925,435 – were recorded in Africa <br /></li>\n<li>Uganda and Kenya were the countries with the highest absolute numbers of probable and confirmed malaria cases in 2009, with some 9.8 million and 8.1 million, respectively<br /></li>\n<li>Of the world's 117,704 in-patient malaria deaths in 2009, 111,885 occurred in Africa<br /></li>\n<li>The Democratic Republic of the Congo recorded the highest number of in-patient malaria deaths – 21,168 – followed by Ivory Coast and Angola<br /></li>\n</ul></p><p>Note: This dataset only contains figures for officially recorded cases.

Selanikio</p><p><strong>Current location: </strong></p><p>Washington, DC and Nairobi, Kenya</p><p><strong>Twitter name: </strong></p><p>@jselanikio</p><p><strong>In 30 words or less tell us who you work for and what you do: </strong></p><p>I'm the CEO and co-founder of DataDyne, a social enterprise based in the US and Kenya that creates technology for the global health and international development community.  We're especially focuses on helping health and other organizations to get better information about the people they're serving.</p><p>I'm also a staff physician in the department of pediatrics at Georgetown University Hospital.</p><p><strong>Do you have a website / blog?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.datadyne.org/blog/3\">http://www.datadyne.org/blog/3</a></p><p><strong>Website you can't live without?</strong></p><p>There are things that I couldn't live without, but they don't include any websites. </p><p><strong>Internet hero?</strong></p><p>Steve Jobs</p><p><strong>What is the ethos of DataDyne? What drives you as an organisation?</strong></p><p>DataDyne has always been about creating technology to serve the needs of global health, and more broadly of international development.  I think what differentiates us from other technology organizations working in that space is that we are as focused on sustainable business models as we are on the programming side: we don't think it's good enough to come up with some technology that does the job but costs a million dollars – because most public health organizations won't be able to afford it.  You've got to give people technology that solves a problem, that is simple to use, and that they can afford.</p><p><strong>How do you provide sustainable, scalable solutions to developing world communities? </strong></p><p>Quick answer? Imitate Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the mobile phone companies – they're the ones that have already done it.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, most health workers in sub-Saharan Africa didn't have access to reliable communications. The majority didn't have access to a good phone line for voice communications, and the majority didn't have access to email for written communications.  Can you imagine how difficult it is to try to maintain a health system in rural Africa without adequate communications?</p><p>Fast forward to 2011: now just about every African health worker above the village level has a mobile phone and at least one webmail account.  This amounts to an enormous jump in capacity – and none of it was created by organizations that were actually trying to benefit international health workers.  In fact, none of it was created by non-profit organizations.</p><p>With the mobile phone – which may prove to be more significant in world history than the printing press – it was entirely a commercial venture focused on selling a low-cost, high-volume product to people in developing countries.  </p><p>In the case of the also-commercial email systems, the amazing thing is that the providers – Microsoft with Hotmail, Google with Gmail, and Yahoo with Yahoo Mail – weren't even thinking about sub-Saharan Africa.  They were focused on getting people in the US to use their service and look at their ads. But because they were creating web applications, all their products were immediately available to everyone, all over the planet.</p><p>The provision of reliable email to virtually every health worker in Africa, then, was an unintended consequence of the business and technology models of those American companies.</p><p>The bottom line is this: the only sustainable and broadly scaled successes at getting information technology to public health in poor countries have been commercial technologies.</p><p>For those of us with the \"social\" goal of aiding public health, it means we need to figure out how to apply the business models and the approach to scale that have been successfully used by business.</p><p><strong>How does not-for-profit status differentiate you from the likes of txteagle and others who are using mobile to help developing countries?</strong></p><p>DataDyne has always been an LLC (limited liability company): a \"for-profit\", but I've always felt that this \"for-profit\" and non-profit\" distinction is pretty nonsensical. You can have the head of a non-profit making $750,000 a year, but DataDyne and txteagle are \"for-profit\"?  </p><p>Anyone who knows anything about Nathan Eagle knows that money is not his primary driver. It's just that he recognizes, as do we, that the only widespread and sustained successes in using mobile to help developing countries have come from the \"for-profit\" sector – and we want to create more successes.</p><p><strong>What help did the UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation provide in getting DataDyne up and running? Is collaboration and partnership they key to any successful social start-up?</strong></p><p>The UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation Technology Partnership provided two key ingredients for our success: seed funding and communications support. Obviously, the funding was important, and we wouldn't have been able to do anything without that, but almost as important was their help in getting the word out about what we were creating.</p><p><strong>What are the hot issues in global health right now, and how are they being addressed?</strong></p><p>Well, of course HIV/AIDS and malaria and TB are still among the big issues that international health organizations are still fighting. Polio is close to global eradication, but the last mile is proving incredibly difficult.  I'd say that in general the global health community has made, and continues to make, tremendous progress.  From my perspective the most exciting aspect, though, is figuring out how we can bring these amazing technologies of mobile phones (really, mobile computers) and the internet to bear against these ongoing problems.</p><p>For example, no matter what health problem you are addressing you need to be able to manage people and materials, yet most health systems in the developing world have only the most rudimentary systems to track, for example, their medical supplies. </p><p>That was understandable when they didn't have any computers, but now every single person in the system – often including all the patients – is walking around with a connected pocket computer.</p><p>Those systems are just not doing very much with that yet: they mostly use those computers (i.e. their cell phones) to make voice calls and send text messages.  We want to show them how to use those computers as computers.</p><p><strong>What is you vision of how the world should be?</strong></p><p>No idea. I'm focused on how DataDyne should be, and that's a big enough job for now.</p><p><strong>And what can we expect from you at Activate New York?</strong></p><p>I'm hoping that I can show people, through the example of our work, that the commercial approaches taken by Google, Facebook, and other companies, have been tremendously beneficial for global health and other causes. </p><p>Of course, by now everyone realizes the tremendous role played by Facebook in the Egyptian revolution, but commercial web tools – including Facebook – are transforming other realms as well, by providing universally-needed capacities to anyone who needs them: to communicate, to coordinate, to create maps, to collect and analyze and distribute information.  </p><p>At DataDyne, we were one of the first organizations to see how, for example, web-based software allows us to dramatically lower the barriers to using our own public health data collection software.</p><p><strong>Joel speaks at the Activate Summit on the 22nd June 2011 at Kings Place in London. <a href=\"http://j.mp/jNtFpX\">Book your place now</a></strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2011/04/20/Joel-Selaniko-140x84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/activate/joel-selanikio-health-care-developing-world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/activate/joel-selanikio-health-care-developing-world","sectionName":"Activate"},{"webTitle":"Close up: Yes they Cannes","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-14T16:00:55Z","sectionId":"film","id":"film/2011/apr/14/close-up-cannes-list-women","fields":{"body":"<h2>The big story</h2><p>You wait two years for a female director at Cannes and then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/apr/14/cannes-film-festival-lynne-ramsay\">four come along at once</a>.

And how has the geography of UK aid spending changed over time?</p><p>In March, the UK launched <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/mar/01/winners-losers-uk-aid-review-reaction?intcmp=239\">the most extensive shake-up of aid in recent history,</a> and controversially cut aid funding to some of the world's least developed countries, including Niger and Burundi.</p><p>The much-anticipated bilateral (country-to-country) aid review significantly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/mar/01/uk-aid-review-bilateral-multilateral\">reduced the geographical scope of DfID's ambition</a>, cutting the number of countries which receive UK aid by a third – from 43 to 27.

The data comes from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and follows the money trail from 1960 to 2009. (We'll have to wait until December to get the figures for 2010). </p><p>The OECD, which marks its 50th anniversary this year, monitors and catalogues levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA), what the rest of us call \"aid.\" Note that ODA figures include both grants and concessional loans. Here we've pulled out gross – rather than net – flows, to look at where the UK spends its money. </p><p>Press play to watch the geography of UK aid shift over time. You can also click on individual countries, and see a running total of its UK aid receipts over the decades.</p><p>A few highlights:</p><blockquote><p>• In 1960 the top recipients of UK aid are Cyprus and Malta, followed by Nigeria and Malaysia.<br />• But by 1961 this geography has already shifted dramatically, with Kenya and India emerging as the top recipients.<br />• For most of the 1960s and 1970s, India gets the biggest chunk of UK aid.<br />• With the new millennium, the sheer number of UK aid recipients seems to explode. In 2002, Serbia emerges as the top recipient, outpacing India. By 2005 Nigeria has taken the top spot, followed by post-invasion Iraq.</p></blockquote><p>Which year saw a spike in UK aid to Malaysia?

They are accused of contributing to an estimated 1,300 deaths in violence following the 2007 presidential election when they were deputy prime minister, head of the civil service and police commissioner respectively.</p><p></p><p>That we learned about the violence in the first place was in part due to the web and mobile phones.</p><p></p><p>Violence erupted when the incumbent Mwai Kibaki was declared the winner in the face of charges of vote rigging from supporters of his challenger, Raila Odinga. It soon spread across ethnic lines in often remote parts of the country far away from the reach of national or international media.</p><p></p><p>An answer to this was the Ushahidi crowdmap – the crowd in this case being Kenyans across the country texting reports of violence from their mobile phones or supplying information via email. Ushahidi means witness in Swahili: the reports were added to an <a href=\"http://kenya.ushahidi.com/main\" title=\"\">online map</a> and within days all those individual witnesses had together compiled a more complete picture of the violence than any one organisation.</p><p></p><p>One of Ushahidi's founders, Ory Okolloh, a lawyer, explained in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/nov/28/internet-radicals-world-wide-web\" title=\"\">an interview last year</a> that Ushahidi started out as \"an ad hoc group of technologists and bloggers hammering out software in a couple of days, trying to figure out a way to gather more and better information about the post-election violence\". The <a href=\"http://www.kenyanpundit.com/2008/01/03/update-jan-3-445-1100-pm/\" title=\"\">January 2008 blogpost</a> in which Okolloh asked for \"any techies out there willing to do a mashup of where the violence and destruction is occurring using Google Maps\" said recording the truth of what was happening right at that moment would help the later process of reconciliation.</p><p></p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a> was born after two sleep-deprived days of coding, <a href=\"http://www.kenyanpundit.com/2008/01/09/ushahidicom/\" title=\"\">Okolloh blogged</a>:</p><p></p><p><blockquote>We believe that the number of deaths being reported by the government, police, and media is grossly under reported. We also don't think we have a true picture of what is really going on – reports that all have us have heard from family and friends in affected areas suggests that things are much worse than what we have heard in the media.<br /><br />We also (in my idealist world) hope that we can begin to put names and faces to the people who have lost their lives in this mess.<br /><br />What's the point of all this you might ask? Well, Kenyans have demonstrated their capacity for selective amnesia time and time again. When this crisis comes to an end we don't want what happened to be swept under the rug in the name of \"moving forward\" – for us to truly move forward, the truth of what happened needs to be told – Ushahidi (<a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com\" title=\"\">www.ushahidi.com</a>) is our small way of contributing to that.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Although put together hastily, it worked. A key feature was that it could accept text messages from mobile phones. But the team running Ushahidi was vital too: to guard against false reports a blogger was enlisted to attempt to verify the facts with aid agencies and other sources on the ground.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't the first example of the idea known as crowdsourcing: that the aggregate of individual efforts could be more than the sum of its parts. Before Ushahidi came Wikipedia, though founder Jimmy Wales dislikes the word crowdmap and calls it a <a href=\"http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-11-30/business/17270917_1_jimmy-wales-wikipedia-wikimedia-foundation/3\" title=\"\">\"vile, vile way of looking at that world\"</a>. One of Ushahidi's eye-catching predecessors tracked the <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl/are-you-being-gouged-milk/\" title=\"\">price of milk, Budweiser and iceberg lettuce</a> in New York grocers. But it was Ushahidi's use in a fast-moving crisis situation, mapping what journalists call hard news, provided inspiration to many others.</p><p></p><p>Crucially it was open source, meaning its computer programming code was freely available to anyone who could use it. Many did. At one end a Kenyan wildlife charity used it to <a href=\"http://wildlifetrackers.wildlifedirect.org/\" title=\"\">track lion and elephant sightings</a> while at the other al-Jazeera used it during the <a href=\"http://labs.aljazeera.net/warongaza/\" title=\"\">2009 Gaza war</a>.</p><p></p><p>The latter stages of Ushahidi's first deployment gave a glimpse of another of its uses: telling those who wanted to do something where their help was most needed by the Kenyans driven from their homes. When Haiti was struck by an earthquake in January 2010, a <a href=\"http://haiti.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi map</a>, backed up by a volunteer network that included Haitian-Americans translating text messages from Creole, was <a href=\"http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/02/06/ushahidi-how-we-are-doing/\" title=\"\">used by search and rescue teams to find survivors</a>.

It's a bold statement by Rakesh Rajani, founder of <a href=\"http://www.twaweza.org/\" title=\"Twaweza\">Twaweza</a>, who was in London for the debate on the future of aid organised by the Overseas Development Institute. Only two years old, Twaweza, which means \"we can make it happen\" in Swahili, is attempting to do just that across three east African countries, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.</p><p>Rajani's strategy is to spread information, believing that crucial to the process of development is access to ideas. Twaweza focuses on what it believes are the five main routes for people to hear new ideas in the region: religion; mobile phones; mass media, in particular radio; fast-moving consumer goods; and teachers. Twaweza builds partnerships in all these areas to spread ideas, draw in new voices and open up conversations. It works rather like a venture fund, initiating ideas and getting new organisations off the ground. Rajani cites <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen\" title=\"Amartya Sen\">Amartya Sen</a>'s comment that poverty is not about a lack of money, but about a lack of options. His aim is to find new ways to intervene in people's lives to widen their options.</p><p>If this sounds vague, how it gets translated into action on specific policy issues is very concrete. Take for example the issue of education. Rajani points out that the Tanzanian schools budget has increased threefold, but there was concern the money wasn't actually getting to the schools themselves. One part of the government's education budget is paid through a capitation fee per child. A Twaweza affiliate, <a href=\"http://www.hakielimu.org/\" title=\"HakiElimu\">HakiElimu</a>, conducted a sample survey of 50 schools across 14 regions by mobile phone, and was able to publish within a month that only 7% of schools were receiving any of their capitation fee.</p><p>The survey results were released to the media and published on Facebook. Within a few weeks, the government was taking action to improve and speed up the distribution of funds to schools. This is what Rajani describes as empowering citizens to take action. HakiElimu (Rajani was one of its co-founders in 2001) has recruited a network of 34,000 \"friends of education\" who can be contacted by email and mobile phone. For the first time, on the ground monitoring of schools is possible.</p><p>Given that one of the biggest problems in education in sub-Saharan Africa is that teachers don't turn up to work, citizen empowerment could make all the difference in ensuring the education system works better.</p><p>Twaweza is rather like an umbrella organisation, and the work it supports and facilitates is hugely diverse. It has helped a new venture, <a href=\"http://www.daraja.org/\" title=\"Daraja\">Daraja</a>, to get off the ground. Daraja aims to make local government more accountable to citizens in rural Tanzania, and has piloted a project in three districts enabling people to report through SMS that their well or water source is not working. Daraja collates the information and sends it to the district water engineer. Every month it produces reports and league tables for districts, which it then sends higher up in the government. It also releases the information to the media and on Facebook. It has proved very effective at \"concentrating the mind\" comments Rajani wryly.</p><p>Twaweza's role is facilitator, linking bright new social entrepreneurs with the technology companies that might be able to help, as well as potential donors and other innovators working on similar ideas across the world.</p><p>Rajani is not interested in small, niche ideas. \"We want to engage citizens in their millions,\" he says – and they are constantly looking for new ways to do it.</p><p>\"We did a deal with the company who produces children's school exercise books in Tanzania, and they have now printed on the inside cover of the books a simple test which parents can do to check on their children's progress. So far, 50 million books now have this test.</p><p>\"We've produced booklets which tell a story incorporating a theme – for example, on solar energy or governance – and these are distributed alongside basic cooking materials, such as cooking oil, by consumer goods companies. So far we have distributed 700,000 of them in this series of stories which change the world. It's about how you get women engaged and get information out.\"</p><p>Another initiative involves working with bishops to produce a guide on citizen engagement, which is going out to Bible study groups. Twaweza in Kenya has worked with Catholic bishops on a Lenten guide on the same subject. Rajani is passionate about the crucial role of religious institutions in the region. They have a capacity to reach and engage people, and help bring about change.</p><p>Yet another initiative developed short, story-based films for television that used humour to explore issues of class and access to education. The films became hugely popular and have provoked plenty of debate.</p><p>The approach may seem scattergun – firing initiatives in different directions – but Rajani's argument is that information and ideas are a kind of ecology, and carefully aimed interventions at different points can have a catalytic impact. Alongside this experimental and flexible approach, Twaweza has a rigorous evaluation policy. It wants to know what works and why. Some initiatives will fail, admits Rajani, but failure is a crucial part of learning. What he wants to avoid is the distortion of much development in which claims to success – spin – are rewarded with more funding, and effectively incentivised.</p><p>At the heart of Rajani's approach is the belief that governments will do the right thing when there is sufficient pressure. The failure of governance in many parts of Africa has been the lack of that effective pressure, but that is fast changing. The proportion of people connected to the internet in east Africa may be low compared with the rest of the world, but it is now the fastest growing. Internet connections through mobiles is booming. In Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda the big phone operators have all signed deals to give free access to Facebook, and the impact will transform the region, providing users with the equivalent of 100 free emails a day.</p><p>\"Within five years, the majority of people will have direct or indirect access to the internet across east Africa,\" says Rajani.</p><p>There are plenty of new ideas in the pipeline for Twaweza. The next big area Rajani wants to move into is health. One of the biggest problems in the developing world is whether medicines get through to the clinics and whether health workers actually turn up to their jobs. At the moment, Tanzania is building a lot of infrastructure in clinics and hospitals, but it has been estimated that less than half the jobs are filled – and of those nominally filled, many employees don't turn up.</p><p>One of the most intriguing aspects of Twaweza is that from the outset it has aimed to be regional rather than national. Africa has been plagued by poor communications between countries, and this is part of a growing impetus behind closer regional co-operation. For Rajani it is surfing a wave of increased cross-border engagement. Countries are tackling similar problems and can learn from one another – and be spurred by competition into greater effort.</p><p>Rajani points to the fact that new research data from <a href=\"http://www.uwezo.net/\" title=\"Uwezo\">Uwezo</a> – another Twaweza affiliate – which monitors educational achievement, shows that the bottom quintile of children in Kenya are performing better than the top quintile in Tanzania. When the research is published, he is hoping it will stir a debate in Tanzania about what it can do to improve educational standards.</p><p>But Rajani is not sure it will. He believes there is still a deferential culture towards the government, and people don't have that sense of agency that something could – and should – be changed. That sense of entitlement that government services can and should work, is what Rajani is trying to provoke. It is basic to the way western democracies work, so it's hard to appreciate how its absence shapes a political culture. But Rajani hopes this is finally changing, and that a new generation will use the contemporary technologies of communication to transform how countries are governed and public services delivered.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2011/3/31/1301589575245/A-teller-at-a-customized--004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/01/citizens-make-development-happen","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/01/citizens-make-development-happen","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Cricket World Cup 2011: Sri Lanka v New Zealand - as it happened | Rob Smyth","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-29T08:37:00Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/2011/mar/29/cricket-world-cup-sri-lanka-new-zealand","fields":{"body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p><strong>Preamble</strong> Pop quiz, hotshot: how many sides have reached more cricket World Cup semi-finals than New Zealand? Answer: none. This is their sixth, which puts them level with Australia and Pakistan (who play their sixth tomorrow, I forget who against). It's a staggering achievement for such a small country. Just as the All Blacks find weird and wonderful ways to underachieve at the rugby World Cup, so it's an immutable law of cricket World Cups that New Zealand will <del>be hopelessly patronised every time they reach the semi-finals</del> overachieve.<br /> <br />Of all their journeys to the last four, this is surely the most improbable. Not just because they are the last non-Asian side standing, but also because they had been in such diabolical form before the tournament. They won just two of their last 16 ODIs leading up to the World Cup, including an infamous 4-0 defeat in Bangladesh. Yet, as usual, they pulled out a performance when it really mattered.<br /> <br />Right, that's enough of blowing smoke up their aperture because, as admirable a side as they are, they need a minor miracle to beat Sri Lanka in Colombo today. They have two chances, and slim generally doesn't do Tuesdays. </p><p>On the face of it, this is a mismatch. New Zealand have never reached a World Cup final, losing all five of their previous semis. Away from the green-tinged grass of home, they have lost 18 of the last 22 ODIs against Sri Lanka. They were thrashed by Sri Lanka earlier in this tournament and in the semi-final of 2007 - and Sri Lanka didn't have home advantage in either of those games<br /> <br />Sri Lanka are superior to New Zealand in every facet of the game except depth of batting. There is, logically, no way New Zealand can win this. But then, as we say most recently on Friday, logic tends to take a back seat with New Zealand at the World Cup.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>New Zealand have won the toss</strong> and will bat first. That's a decent toss to win on a pitch that should get slower and lower as the day progresses (it's the same pitch on which they eviscerated England three days ago). Muttiah Muralitharan is fit, so Sri Lanka are unchanged, while New Zealand bring in the seamer Andy McKay for the left-arm spinner Luke Woodcock. </p><p><strong>Sri Lanka</strong> Tharanga, Dilshan, Sangakkara (c/wk), Jayawardene, Samaraweera, Silva, Mathews, Malinga, Muralitharan, Mendis, Herath.</p><p><strong>New Zealand</strong> Guptill, B McCullum (wk), Ryder, Taylor, Styris, Williamson, N McCullum, Oram, Vettori (c), Southee, McKay.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>Some pre-match statgasms, c/o <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/infostradalive\">Infostrada</a></strong></p><blockquote><p> <br />• There has never been an all-Asian final before<br />• New Zealand haven't won an ODI in Colombo since 1986<br />• Sri Lanka haven't lost a World Cup game against New Zealand since they got in 1996<br />• No host or co-host has reached the World Cup final since Sri Lanka in 1996</p></blockquote><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>The first email of the day</strong> \"Rob, could you please stop with all the comic asides and just give me details of the cricket?\" says Alex Netherton. \"So far you've given no descriptions of the action.\"</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>1st over: New Zealand 4-0 (Guptill 4, B McCullum 0)</strong> Shall we do this thing? Let's do this thing. Lasith Malinga is going to bowl the first over of the innings – but hang on, what's this? We now have <em>three</em> commentators. They are copying the Channel 9 system. At the moment it's Tony Greig, Russel Arnold and Ian Botham. <em>Three</em> commentators. Really? It doesn't feel right. Not since the episode of Father Ted when Dougal was running scared of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP0NkL-QfvE\">the sheep-killing beast with four arses</a> has there seemed such an odd number of something. Anyway, after four dot balls Guptill gets New Zealand up and running with a confident clip over midwicket for four. \"Rob,\" says Daniel Pfeiffer, \"if you actually report the cricket I'm off to cricinfo, I don't even really like cricket but this is a great break from tedium.\" Fish fingers, Easy A, retro football tops, blond nu-mullets, Tony Soprano, Mungo Jerry, Top Trumps, Beef Disco's, quarts of Liver Compromiser. That do you for now?</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>2nd over: New Zealand 10-0 (Guptill 5, B McCullum 5)</strong> Sri Lanka open the bowling with spin, as they did on Saturday, but this time it's Rangana Herath rather than Tillakaratne Dilshan. That's because New Zealand have two right handers, whereas England had the left-handed Strauss. The second ball is a miserable half tracker that McCullum, who won't die wondering like England did, pulls meatily for four. \"B McCullum has had a dismal (might be a little harsh but I'm in a foul mood) tournament so far,\" says Matt Turland, who is in such a foul mood that he even refused to refer to McCullum by his first name. \"If New Zealand are going to stand any chance of winning, he needs to do something special at the top of the order. Either that, or accidentally let go of his bat and injure half of the SL team. The second option seems more likely.\"</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>3rd over: New Zealand 16-0 (Guptill 11, B McCullum 5)</strong> A bowling change already, with Mathews replacing Malinga. The latter bowls best with the old ball, so it makes sense to save him. Guptill flicks the first ball to short fine leg, where the hamstrung Murali makes a total meal of it and the ball goes for four. This is a big risk with Murali today. He told Tony Greig that he's only 65 per cent fit. Surely they should have taken the gamble that they would win this game and tried to get him as fit as possible for the final? Guptill flicks two more through the peculiarly vacant midwicket area, and this is a good start for New Zealand. \"Very impressed to read this morning that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/mar/28/icc-world-cup\">Lord Selvey himself apparently saved 50-over cricket last year</a>,\" says Lee Rodwell. \"Now you know exactly who to blame during the BMOs. Any chance he could do something similar for the NHS\\British economy\\red squirrel\\T-Bone Steak Roysters?\" How about Peep Show? Maybe a guest appearance from Selve could bring Peep Show back to its glory days.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>4th over: New Zealand 16-0 (Guptill 11, B McCullum 5)</strong> A fine over from Herath to McCullum is a maiden. The fourth ball was a beauty that turned enough to take the leading edge, and that was a little ominous for New Zealand. \"Rob, you're not going to resign are you?\" chirps Nigel Smith. \"It does seem to be the trend at the moment. Don't listen to those people who want you to talk about cricket.\" Well, I think I've taken the OBO as far as I can, and it's time for somebody else to see if they can lower the bar even further.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>5th over: New Zealand 20-0 (Guptill 15, B McCullum 5)</strong> Apparently our auto-refresh isn't working again. Sorry about this. Just get intimate with F5 for the latest news. It's not that long since you were together on a daily basis. The old magic will still be there. Guptill has started authoritatively and drives Mathews' second ball nicely through mid on for four. This is a decent start for New Zealand although, as against South Africa, there are too many dot balls: 23 out of 30 so far. You do the math. \"Rob, it's 4am here in the States, and I'm still conscious for this game,\" apologises David Naylor. \"Had no intention of being so. Any advice for when I have to actually be awake and attentive in four hours? I figured I'd ask you since 1) you love e-mails so much and 2) you're a savvy veteran of this time of night. Also, I'll take NZ to win this one. I mean, they keep getting to these things, they've gotta win one sooner or later. Right? Right?\" Just bathe your face in coffee when you wake up. That usually works regardless of how little sleep you have.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>6th over: New Zealand 29-0 (Guptill 17, B McCullum 11)</strong> Having defended a maiden in Herath's previous over, McCullum slog-sweeps the first ball of this one for six! That was a fine stroke. There's a huge LBW appeal against McCullum later in the over from a ball that pitches on off stump and straightens appreciably. I reckon that was hitting off stump, but Aleem Dar said not out and Sri Lanka accepted that decision. They were right to eschew the review, because replays showed it was hitting the outside of off stump and therefore the original decision would have stood. \"Any thoughts on the wisdom of replacing a spinner with a seamer on a slow/moribund track?\" says Martin Sinclair. \"Can't say I know much about either of them, but I'm sure they're both brave little soldiers and keen as mustard to over perform and be patronised by likes of me.\" Well Luke Woodcock look a fraction out of his depth on Friday, and Sri Lanka are even better players of spin. I assume that was the thinking. I don't know much about McKay, mind.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>7th over: New Zealand 32-0 (Guptill 18, B McCullum 13)</strong> Three singles from Mathews' over. Tony Greig, one of the 19 commentators talking simultaneously, reckons New Zealand need 280 or more. \"Ah come now, Rob, don't be so hard on yourself,\" says Paddy McQueen. \"You've plenty more depths to plunge at the helm of the OBO. Keep on sinking, old chap.\"</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 32-1 (B McCullum b Herath 13)</strong> The dangerous Brendon McCullum has gone. He tried to slog-sweep the first delivery of Herath's over, and the ball went straight on with the arm to hit off stump as McCullum played over the top of it. That was a pretty ugly dismissal, and it continues McCullum's horrible tournament: he has made 16, 6, 14, 4 and 13 against the Test-playing nations.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>8th over: New Zealand 34-1 (Guptill 19, Ryder 1)</strong> \"Matt Turland's remarks about McCullum remind me of the first time I watched televised cricket with my girlfriend (now wife),\" says Edmund King. \"After a few thoughtful minutes of silence, she opined, 'you know, this game would be more interesting if they just randomly released some lions onto the field. Right about now'. Moral of story: be wary about marrying classics graduates.\"</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>9th over: New Zealand 37-1 (Guptill 20, Ryder 3)</strong> Three commentators! I can't get used to this. Now we have Nasser Hussain, David Lloyd and Simon Doull. Maybe we should have three OBO commentators. Two proper writers and, for a bit of variety, a token joke figure. Insert your own joke here. Ryder gets away with one there, clunking Mathews just over the man at short extra cover. Sri Lanka are starting to put the squeeze on, with just runs from the last three overs. \"I see that the review of the winter is to take place in a few weeks,\" says Luke Richardson. \"Will Smyth's schedule be up for discussion? Whereas England may only privately admit to the exhausting nature of their winter, Rob is gutsy enough to open up and declare his use (in whatever amounts Dean Conway sees fit if England take this on) Liver Compromiser, Mood Elevation Facilitator and the like. Of course, there may be more people at an Andrew Strauss press conference than there are here so the benefit of sharing the problem is, as I think we've often seen, limited. Certainly there's no evidence to suggest that Rob's method of coping works.\" I'm funny how? Like a clown, etc, etc.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>10th over: New Zealand 38-1 (Guptill 21, Ryder 3)</strong> Here comes the magical mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis, whose figures in this tournament are stunning: he has an economy rate of just 3.01, the best in the tournament of anyone who has bowled 10 overs or more. Just one from his first over. New Zealand have to find a way to manoeuvre him for at least 40. \"Isn't the World Cup wonderfully enjoyable now that England are out?\" says Anna Richardson. \"My finger nails can regrow and I don't have to hide behind the imaginary sofa or throw things at my telly/computer screen any more. I'm trying to resist adopting a secondary team, as that will be its death knell – oh, what the heck: go the Black Caps!\"</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>11th over: New Zealand 42-1 (Guptill 24, Ryder 4)</strong> Sri Lanka take their bowling Powerplay straight away, and Ryder edges Mathews through the vacant slip area for a single. Murali is off the field, stretching his hamstring. Four from the over, which makes it 13 from the last five. \"Should Lee Rodwell work anywhere near Fleet Street,\" says Andrew Benzeval, \"he will find T-bone steak Roysters in the little convenience shop opposite the Natwest.  60 pence well spent.  I've not seen any red squirrels in there though, living, chocolate or otherwise...\" Even if he lives in Timbuktu, it's worth making the trip over for, right.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>12th over: New Zealand 50-1 (Guptill 27, Ryder 9)</strong> Ryder gets his first boundary, cutting Mendis to the fence. A helping of singles make that a much needed good over for New Zealand, eight from it. \"I wish,\" says Kristian Petterson, that <a href=\"http://www.teaandkittens.co.uk/\">I'd had this on Saturday</a>...\" If only everything in the world was <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2008/05/20/lolcat2.article.jpg\">as cute as wide-eyed cats</a>.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>13th over: New Zealand 57-1 (Guptill 29, Ryder 14)</strong> New Zealand are starting to pick up the singles, which is something they failed to do on Friday. Three of those in that Mathews over, and then a lovely drive over the covers for four by Ryder. This is good, clear-headed stuff from New Zealand. \"I am finishing up in my current job this Friday so any previous attempts to conceal OBO have all but gone,\" says Ewan Dunnett, who may or may not also be demonstrating his commitment by having his boot on a desk while draining a bottle of Remy Martin, burping loudly and drawing on the biggest cigar anyone has ever seen. \"I even tried to launch everythingontv to watch a stream of the game. Sadly my office broadband doesn't support such streaming. LONG LIVE CRICKET!\" That last week of school/job feeling is a beautiful thing. Sadly, having not had a full-time job for years, I've forgotten what it's like. My last day at Wisden was the 2003 final, mind, and watching Ricky Ponting smear India to various parts of Johannesburg was a nice leaving present.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>14th over: New Zealand 58-1 (Guptill 30, Ryder 14)</strong> It looks like 250 is a bare minimum for New Zealand. If they can get up past 275 that should put pressure on Sri Lanka's underused middle order. They are finding it difficult against Mendis, though: just one from that over, and his figures are now 3-0-10-0.  \"It has been concerning me for a little while now that Kumar Sangakkara appears to be wearing some type of BMX helmet rather than a more usual cricket helmet,\" says Jim Clear. \"Does its aerodynamic structure help him to glide through the air better when he's behind the stumps?  Or does he perhaps have a crush on Nicole Kidman?\" When you're as effortlessly cool as Sangakkara, you can do what you like.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>15th over: New Zealand 60-1 (Guptill 31, Ryder 15)</strong> Murali is on. The hamstring doesn't look bad as he comes in, straight around the wicket to the right hander. Just two singles from the over. He destroyed New Zealand in the group game in Mumbai, and that will be on their mind. \"See I was right and Ricky Ponting did get the flick as Aussie captain,\" says Kate in Sydney. \"His own decision? I doubt that! He jumped before he was pushed. All over the news here, on ALL channels. I don't envy Michael Clarke , he's not been batting well either. Good luck Pup.\" I know he wants to carry on as a batsman, but I can't remember the last time an Australian captain went back to the ranks. So we are probably saying farewell to one of the all-time great batsmen. If so, that bloody-minded epic last week was a fitting final innings.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>16th over: New Zealand 62-1 (Guptill 32, Ryder 16)</strong> Mendis's variations are so intimidating for batsmen. It's really difficult to take risks because you've no idea which way it will spin, or indeed if it will spin. New Zealand are becalmed against him for now, with just two more from that over. \"Enjoying the OBO in sunny Cyprus, having moved here a month ago,\" says Paul Maguire, who mis-spelt 'enduring'. \"Trying to learn the language but as they saying goes, 'it's all Greek to me'. Try the veal.\"</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>17th over: New Zealand 67-1 (Guptill 34, Ryder 19)</strong> A false stroke from Ryder, who bottom edges Murali to third man for three. \"Where does the idea come from that more commentators means more viewer interest?\" says Richard Craig. \"They keep ruining sports like this. Tennis was the first to go this way - all the more upsetting when you listen to the repeats in the rain delays at Wimbledon of a lone Dan Maskell joyously saying nothing for minutes at a time. Rugby keeps popping off to the touchline for a quick chat with Colin Charvis or Lawrence Dallaglio, who usually add nothing more than: 'Ireland need to improve if they're going to win this.' There's really only so much you can say about a sport - hence, I would imagine, the over-reliance you have on fish-finger-related anecdotalism.\" Ha. I might put that on my CV, or add it to my small talk. </p><blockquote><p><em>\"What do you do for a living?\" <br />[Brent]\"I'm a fish-finger-related anecdotalist, yeah?\"[/Brent]</em></p></blockquote><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>18th over: New Zealand 68-1 (Guptill 35, Ryder 19)</strong> One from Mendis's over. They can't do anything with him. It's time for a drink. \"Kim Hughes played on after his tearful resignation,\" says Phil Lewis. \"Ricky will play on, I think.  You can't draw lessons from what happened with what Australia did for 20 glory-drenched years, with what will happen in the current pretty dire condition of the team.  Pup will probably also give up the captaincy after a few disastrous series and still play on.\" I disagree. The clean-break philosophy served them so well in the glory years – and when Hughes went soon after that tearful resignation – that I think they will want to the same. They have found a potential No3 in Khawaja, the next Ashes series is years away, and, as Ian Healy among others will tell you, the Australian selectors do not do sentiment. I'd be pretty surprised if he played another game for them.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 69-2 (Ryder c Sangakkara b Muralitharan 19)</strong> Murali strikes in his third over. It was a masterful piece of bowling, a quicker ball that bounced appreciably to take the top edge as Ryder tried to cut. Sangakkara took a sharp reaction catch and tossed the ball up in delight. He's a wonderful keeper, particularly to this man. Murali barely bothered to celebrate; he's seen so many suckers fall for that one over the last 19 years.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>19th over: New Zealand 72-2 (Guptill 37, Taylor 2)</strong> It's happening to New Zealand, just as it happened to England: the last six overs have produced only 15 runs, and that wicket. \"It's now 11pm here in NZ and I really must sleep before I get hooked into this game and pull an all-nighter,\" says Myles Thomas. \"Is there any way of enjoying OBO while asleep?\" I think most experienced OBO readers would concur that it's much more enjoyable when you are sound asleep.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>20th over: New Zealand 74-2 (Guptill 38, Taylor 3)</strong> Herath replaces Mendis, who bowled a supreme first spell of 5-0-13-0. Two from the over, and New Zealand are going nowhere. \"As Ricky begins the long passage into folklore, how exactly shall we define the verb/adjective 'Ponting'?\" wonders John Starbuck. \"He seems destined to be remembered for stroppiness rather than ability, but such is the nature of the game.\" I think that, when the dust settles, history will be more sympathetic towards him. Personally I'll recall him for that period between 2001 and 2004, when he <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/7133.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;spanmax1=10+Jan+2004;spanmin1=08+Oct+2001;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">averaged an amazing 78</a>.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>21st over: New Zealand 79-2 (Guptill 39, Taylor 6)</strong> Taylor pushes tentatively at a Murali doosra and edges it low past slip for three. The next ball pops a little and takes the leading edge of Guptill's bat, but it falls safely on the off side. \"You just printed an email from a man who claims to enjoy listening to a man saying nothing while staring at rain,\" says Allan Crocker. \"Are you alright? Personally I'm so nostalgic about commentary minimalism I'm currently rewatching New Zealand/Sri Lanka in the 1997 World Cup. On Ceefax.\" The 1997 World Cup? Who, indeed, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/67191.html\">could forget Debbie Hockley's hundred</a>?</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 84-3 (Guptill b Malinga 39)</strong> Glorious fast bowling from Lasith Malinga. He came back to check if the ball was reversing, and picked up Guptill third ball with a stunning yorker that curved in a touch to smash into the base of middle stump. Guptill tried to jam his bat down but his backlift was too big and so he was too late. Malinga punches the air and yells with delight. That was breathtakingly good.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>22nd over: New Zealand 84-3 (Taylor 11, Styris 0)</strong> Styris's first ball is another cracking yorker that so nearly sneaks through. How the hell do play these yorkers? Like piles, you know it's coming but there's not a lot you can do about it. \"I know this is about cricket, so you shouldn't print it,\" says Alex Netherton, \"but is there a case, given Australia's Test team's diabolical middle order, of Ponting dropping down to replace some of the filth?\" He could certainly reinvent himself as a cussed firefighter at No5 or No6, but a) he is a very proud man and I don't know if he will want to go down from No3 and b) I just think the Aussie selectors will want a clean break. Who knows?</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>23rd over: New Zealand 84-3 (Taylor 11, Styris 0)</strong> Taylor shapes to cut a ball from Murali that rips back towards him, and he's just able to squeeze it down on the off side. A maiden, and New Zealand are in trouble. \"It's sad for Ponting that he'll be remembered for his captaincy more than his batting (barring a Sachin-esque Indian Summer),\" says Indranath Neogy. \"But it's because he was unlucky enough to be great at a time when Lara and Tendulkar were also great - and Ricky's batting just wasn't as dramatic, probably because we knew that even if he didn't score big, Warne and McGrath could probably bowl the opposition out.\" Yep, this is spot on. But he is up there with Border, Steve Waugh and Greg Chappell as the greatest Aussie batsmen of the modern era.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>24th over: New Zealand 90-3 (Taylor 14, Styris 3)</strong> The defiant mediocrity demonstrated in the bedroom by your average OBOer might suggest otherwise, but there's nothing as thrilling as unorthodoxy, and in that respect Sri Lanka's bowling attack is the best in the world by a country mile. Malinga continues, and there are six from the over, all in ones and twos. The penultimate ball is another superb yorker that Styris just digs out. \"Enjoying the OBO in my room with my window open and summer tunes on,\" says Hannah Coleman. \"Now England are out, I've got no excuse not to revise Serbian grammar and get on with my dissertation. However, here I am following New Zealand. They're basically blood anyway, right? Come on New Zealand! (Or Hajde Novi Zeland! for all the Serbs.)\" Serbian Grammar? Isn't that the name of a dodgy indie/jazz band playing in Hoxton tonight?</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>25th over: New Zealand 93-3 (Taylor 16, Styris 4)</strong> Tillakaratne Dilshan is going to bowl his part-time, Strauss-busting off spin. New Zealand might have to target him – they have to target <em>some</em>one, surely – but for now they are content with three singles. \"Averages aren't everything of course, but surely Punter isn't just \"up there\" with the Chappell and Waugh sisters, AB etc,\" says Phil Lewis. \"He's above them and second only to Sir Donald.\" I'm not sure about it. It's really hard to compare this era with the 1980s and 1990s, because averages are so much higher. Could Punter have made <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63368.html\">100 not out and 98 not out to earn a draw</a> against the West Indies in Trinidad? Probably not. But then could Allan Border have scored dominant double hundreds in consecutive Tests against India? Probably not. If I had to pick between the four, I reckon I might just pick Border, but they're almost impossible to split.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>26th over: New Zealand 102-3 (Taylor 17, Styris 12)</strong> This is reversing dangerously for Malinga, although Styris is using a much shorter backlift and is able to dig one and then punch the next delivery through extra cover for four. That's the thing with the yorker, if you underpitch a fraction you can get punished, as Styris shows with a beautiful straight drive for four more off the last ball of the over. \"At the other end of the spectrum I've just started a new job and am trying to hide the fact that my right hand screen is covered with cricket based info,\" says Rob Broke. \"Pretty sure no one saw me just tilt it a few degrees more away from my neighbour...(A move that I appreciate is almost as subtle as screaming howzat repeatedly while staring at your monitor.) Still don't get all the fuss about fish fingers, if I'm going for a breadcrumb encased food item then it'll be a scotch egg every time.\" Scotch eggs? Sheer gastrofolly.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>27th over: New Zealand 109-3 (Taylor 20, Styris 13)</strong> Dilshan screws his first ball down the leg side for three wides, and then Taylor premeditates a lap for a couple. New Zealand really want him around for the last ten overs, when he can be devastating.<br />\"Am I the only one that finds Sri Lanka's 'strangle' cricket duller than watching paint dry?\" asks Rory Alexander. \"Incredibly slow wickets, with a phalanx of spinners operating at Premadasa is a concoction they've perfected over the years. They might win, but for a World Cup semi-final it makes for really dreary cricket.\" Really? I love watching those unorthodox maverick geniuses. All ODI innings have dull spells, though. Blame Selvey for that.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>28th over: New Zealand 113-3 (Taylor 21, Styris 15)</strong> Malinga is replaced by Herath, whose first ball brings a huge shout for LBW when Styris misses a premeditated lap. It was sliding on and would certainly have hit the stumps, but Styris was fractionally outside the line of off stump and the ever excellent Aleem Dar said not out. Four from the over. New Zealand will have to push on soon. \"Given his obvious greatness with the bat, it's perhaps surprising that my greatest memory of Ponting is him taking MP Vaughan's wicket at Trent Bridge in the 2005 Ashes,\" says Lee Calvert. \"Not sure I've seen such sheer, unfettered joy on his hamster-face at any other time.\"</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>29th over: New Zealand 118-3 (Taylor 23, Styris 18)</strong>  The last boundary off a spinner was in the 12th over, and that run continues with five singles off Dilshan. \"Ponting,\" begins Richard Marsden. \"Pont (v): 1. To argue volubly and indignantly with an official; to harangue. e.g.: 'Now the players are surrounding the referee and there's the captain at the head of it all, ponting away with his arms outstretched.  2. To attempt to deceive. e.g.: 'Oh come on Nigel, stop ponting me off. I saw you licking her ear over a quattro formaggi romana in Pizza Express.'\"</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>30th over: New Zealand 122-3 (Taylor 24, Styris 21)</strong> Mendis is back. Unless you pick him, and none of the New Zealand batsmen appear to, it's such a tough job, like trying to do a Rubik's Cube with a blindfold on. Four from the over. \"Been busy multi-tasking,\" says Lord Selvey. \"But I see the comments about commentators. This is because of ESPN-induced chaos in which few people appeared to know where they were going until the last minute. Thus Atherton found himself on his way to Mohali yesterday. Bumble hadn't done a game for nine days and was uncertain to get this one. Greigy, who is sort of ESPN's resident Sri Lonka expert, was bumped off the game, and told to go to do studio stuff in Delhi with Lord Snooty, and pretty much said, 'bollocks I'm going home'. The upshot is that they have eight commentators at this game and unless some are to do only one 20-minute session, the only way to squeeze them in is as trios. Hope that helps!\" Cheers. Now go and save the world like you saved 50-over cricket, Superselve.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>31st over: New Zealand 124-3 (Taylor 25, Styris 22)</strong> Murali is also back in the attack. Murali from one end, Mendis at the other, both starving you of oxygen. What on earth do you do? Settle for two singles, in this case. \"If we are listing great Ponting moments, or at least those that embodied Ponting the cricketer and man, then surely the moment when he was struck on the mouth by Prior in the 2009 Ashes must be right up there?\" says Andrew Hurley. \"Didn't flinch, wiped away the blood and told his worried teammates to go back to their fielding positions, as if they were wrong to be concerned. He must have been in agony, yet returned to field in the exact same position. That, for me, was Ponting all over - tough, fearless and an out and out scrapper.\" That's true, but only up to a point I'd say. It's a shame that we inevitably remember the later years of a player's career, when they are usually more reliant on mental strength as the talent and the fearlessness fade, rather than their peak years. Ponting was/is extremely tough, but first and foremost he was/is a batting genius. Remember the excitement when he first came on the scene, and then that golden period when he drove, flicked and swivel pulled bowling attacks into submission? He was unbelievably good.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>32nd over: New Zealand 134-3 (Taylor 25, Styris 32)</strong> As Lord Selvey points out, New Zealand being in a World Cup final brings to mind \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pgJAsdKAzc\">the fastest ball ever bowled in the history of the universe</a>\". Tony Greig's four-stage orgiastic commentary is hilarious. Almost as good as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIb1PQQRcNk#t=1m40s\">his similar commentary for Shane Warne's hat-trick</a> in 1994-95. Not even Meg Ryan enjoyed herself that much. Anyway, Malinga is back and a looping bouncer is pulled for four by Styris, who has played with impressive purpose thus far. Such an underrated cricketer, this bloke, and he ends a good over by driving Malinga through extra cover for four to bring up the fifty partnership. \"Aleem Dar,\" chin-strokers Phil Smith. \"Aleem Dar. He's so good that if I was given out by Hawkeye I'd ask for a review from Aleem Dar.\" Ha, that's a great line. And in the spirit of The Social Network, which I watched last night, I'll be coming up with my own <del>imperceptibl</del> subtle variation on it that will make me a billionaire. Or something.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>33rd over: New Zealand 137-3 (Taylor 27, Styris 32)</strong> Three from Murali's over. As we said before, 250 is probably a minimum for New Zealand, but nobody knows anything really. I think that might be the phrase ever; you can use it anywhere and it works. \"To say I'm having a shocker of a week at work would be an understatement, a bit like saying Harmison's ball in Brisbane in 2006 was a touch wide of off stump, or that Tendulkar is a bit handy,\" says Guy Hornsby. \"So the OBO - that's you Smyth, and only you - is my only respite from the doom. Yes, it's that good. Still, this is a fascinating contest. There's something great about the nip-and-tuck of this Sri Lanka attack. I don't think there's one truly orthodox bowler in their first two pairs, and it means the batsmen will never settle. God, I have about as much chance of picking Mendis as I do resisting a crate of Liver Compromiser by the time I get to Friday.\"</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>34th over: New Zealand 139-3 (Taylor 28, Styris 33)</strong> The ball is still reversing – this is the last before the mandatory ball change – so Malinga continues. He has gone for a few, 34 in five overs before this, but he has always been a threat and Sangakkara would like to break this dangerous partnership. Nothing doing in that over. \"Who ya gonna call?\" says Superselve, who has now sacked off his work and is preparing a cape. Maybe something with a big S on? Nobody has had that idea.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>35th over: New Zealand 142-3 (Taylor 29, Styris 35)</strong> Three singles from the returning Herath's over. As well as saving the entire known universe, and Peep Show, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2011/mar/29/ricky-ponting-australia-captain-cricket\">SuperSelve has written this piece on Ricky Ponting</a>. I'll print that off for the journey home. \"I have a hunch that NZ will win today,\" says Anand. \"They just need a few of those Amla-like dismissals.\" The key are early wickets: ideally ten but at least two. Sri Lanka may have a soft centre, but nobody really knows because very few people have got at it yet.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>36th over: New Zealand 149-3 (Taylor 30, Styris 41)</strong> That's a splendid shot from Styris, who gives Mendis the charge – <em>there be monsters</em>, as Mark Corrigan would say – and spanks him down the ground, all along the turf, for four. He has 40 from 48 balls and is playing a textbook middle-overs innings. \"I miss South Africa,\" says Ian Copestake. \"In future tournaments can't chokers be given special sanction against their inevitable last-ditch defeats so that they at least make it to the semis. It's so entertaining.\"</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>37th over: New Zealand 153-3 (Taylor 32, Styris 43)</strong> Four singles from Dilshan's over. \"While on Ponting, he has to be the best puller in the business of anything fractionally short,\" says Ajay Patta. \"Perhaps the best of his generation? And I say that while recalling how a certain B.C. Lara treated those slightly-short-of-a-length deliveries.\" For one year in particular, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WVQBk5wnPQ\">Michael Vaughan pulled like a dream</a>, but I would still put Ponting at the top, yep. That swivel-pull was the surest thing this side of taxes and loneliness.</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>38th over: New Zealand 159-3 (Taylor 35, Styris 46)</strong> Taylor sweeps Mendis very fine for three and then Styris back cuts a couple more. \"I thought I'd share with you the email my Aussie friend Treacle sent to me back on July 29 1997,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"'<em>I'll tell you who Punter is, though I have a feeling you'll be sick of hearing it...That name will give you nightmares in years to come. At 22 with 8 Tests, a ton and 4 x 50s under his belt, he's set to plunder seamers for years to come. [He's also] got what it takes upstairs to be a great player. He's actually a fine Aussie Rules player...and has the bottle to mix it in any circumstances, as he showed the other day...you know a bloke must have a bit of filth about him just to cross the white line</em>.' I've had to edit the swearing about it, but 'a great player with a bit of filth about him' pretty much sums up Ponting for me. And this email showed alarming prescience for a man who got his nickname for being so slow between the wickets.\" As a man sporting dubious attire in a place called Kings Cross, I'm loath to talk about Ponting's filth.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>39th over: New Zealand 161-3 (Taylor 36, Styris 47)</strong> Two from Herath's over. Taylor has been very careful, with just one boundary from 54 deliveries. He will have to open his shoulders pretty soon, mind. \"A thought amidst all this praise for the Sri Lankan bowling attack...\" says Edward Mitchell. \"While they are undeniably enjoyable to watch, it will be intriguing to see if they will be as mesmerising and dominating if they get a chance to bowl on a Mumbai road on Saturday. If India reach the final, Sehwag and Tendulkar might actually manage the 'fearless' approach England trumpeted but demonstrably failed to carry out.\"</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 161-4 (Taylor c Tharanga b Mendis 36)</strong> What a  waste. Having played so carefully Taylor clouts a long hop from Mendis straight to deep midwicket. It came off the bottom of the bat, which was why it didn't travel all the way. That was a filthy delivery, particularly by Mendis's standards. That's a big blow to New Zealand, who had a lot of eggs in the basket marked 'Ross Taylor's death-hitting'.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>40th over: New Zealand 165-4 (Styris 49, Williamson 2)</strong> \"Roysters update – they are now only 42p,\" myumyums Andrew Benzeval. \"What a saving!  If you can avoid the chuggers on the way there that is.  On the Aussie captaincy front, I see poor old MA Taylor has been left out.  For shame?\" We're stupid, but not that stupid. We were talking about batsmen rather than captains. Taylor was certainly the most imaginative and probably the best of those captains; although, as with the batsmen, Australia were quite lucky that they had the perfect captain for each stage of their development. Border made them hard to beat, Taylor made them hard to draw against, and Waugh made them the most terrifying thing this side of that weird back-alley creature in Mulholland Drive.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>41st over: New Zealand 169-4 (Styris 51, Williamson 4)</strong> Styris reaches a controlled fifty, from 64 balls. He's played well but New Zealand are still well behind. Four singles from Herath's over. If they are to post a competitive total, they played need to score at ten an over for the rest of the innings. \"Who the hell,\" says Fraser Thomas, \"retains an email from a mate written in 1997?\" <em>[Brent]I've still got one from 1979, so... [/Brent]</em></p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>42nd over: New Zealand 180-4 (Styris 53, Williamson 12)</strong> New Zealand have <strong>taken the batting Powerplay</strong>, so back comes Lasith Malinga. Williamson takes a suicidal single to mid off from the second ball, but Jayawardene misses the stumps. Williamson was barely halfway down the wicket, and Sri Lanka will regret that if he goes on to score a 24-ball hundred. There are four of them, chipped confidently over mid on. He then clumps a high full toss over cover for three, and there are 11 from the over.<br />\"Best Ponting memory – his 140-odd in the 2003 World Cup final,\" says Sam Blackledge. \"He seemed like he could have got as many runs as he wanted that day. He just kept depositing Zaheer Khan over long on. Oh and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNPRA7RTRPs\">this shot isn't bad either</a>.\" The odd thing about that World Cup final innings is that he started scratchily. I think there was only one four in the first fifty. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCQTTWYG_iM\">And then he went ballistic</a>. In fact I've just checked, and his last 90 runs in that innings came from 47 balls. Oof.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>43rd over: New Zealand 190-4 (Styris 54, Williamson 21)</strong> Williamson walks down the track and calmly drives Murali high over mid off for four. What a beautiful shot that is, and he makes it consecutive boundaries when he rocks back to slap a cut through the covers. Murali dismissed him with the minimum of fuss in the group game, but this is a splendid response from an impressive young batsman who is currently averaging 98 (with a strike rate of 106) in the tournament. Angelo Mathews, meanwhile, has pulled something and is leaving the field. \"Er, Rob,\" says Andre van der Walt. \"In over 39 you wrote 'He will have to open his shoulders pretty soon, mind' and when he gets out immediately after that it's 'What a waste. Having played so carefully Taylor clouts a long hop..'. May I suggest you change that to 'foolishly following my advice, Taylor clouts a long hop...'?\" You may suggest I wear a scented, ripped string vest if you like, but I'm not going to that or change the Taylor entry: his mistake was in the execution of the shot, not the choice of it.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 192-5 (Williamson LBW b Malinga 22)</strong> Kane Williamson's chipper cameo of 22 from 16 balls comes to an end when he walks across his stumps and misses a full, straight, inswinging delivery from Malinga. That was plumb LBW. I'm not sure he needed to premeditate a shot like that, because he was playing extremely well.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>44th over: New Zealand 192-5 (Styris 55, N McCullum 0)</strong> A brilliant over from Malinga: one wicket, two runs. \"I assume,\" says Will Carrodus, \"that Angelo Mathews' impressive achievement (43rd over) is just part of the 'maverick' Sri Lankan attitude then?\" Haha, that made me do a real LOL when I realised what you were referring to.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>45th over: New Zealand 204-5 (Styris 55, N McCullum 9)</strong> Murali's ninth over goes for 12, with Nathan McCullum pinging a superb drive over extra cover for six. Shot! New Zealand have been excellent in the Powerplay, with 35 runs from four overs so far. \"Sangakkara and his helmet,\" says Daniel Harris. \"First of all, oo-er. Second of all, is he also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4s2IimFn-c\">a speedball player</a>?\" Oh man I missed being thrashed on that game. I must get a Spectrum joystick so I can play these games. I tried Kick Off 2 on the PC the other night but it's impossible with keys. Either that or I am just utterly inept. The two, I suppose, are not mutually exclusive.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 204-6 (N McCullum c Sangakkara b Malinga 9)</strong> Another one for Malinga, this time with the slower ball. McCullum had a huge heave to leg and the kicked off the pitch to take the edge on its way through to Kumar Sangakkara.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>46th over: New Zealand 210-6 (Styris 56, Oram 5)</strong> Oram opens the face to edge Malinga's yorker for four, and that completes a decent Powerplay for New Zealand, with 41 runs coming from five overs. \"IMHO, Ponting was the best attacking batsman of his generation,\" says Arvind Ramanan. \"He did not have to carry his team because he had plenty of support except for the latter part of his career. The best feature of his character was that he took it upon himself to go after the best bowlers that the opposition had, intimidated them and beat them into submission. He made very good bowlers – Akhtar, Waqar, Srinath, Kumble, Vaas, Anderson etc –  look much more mediocre and powerless than they actually were. It appeared like he took bowlers' dominance very personally. He was a prat, but what a talented one. I for one am happy that our Indian bowlers don't have to face up to the task of bowling to him again.\" I would say Lara was a better attacking batsman, the one who made bowlers feel totally helpless, but Ponting certainly deserves overall comparison with Lara, Tendulkar, Dravid and Steve Waugh as the best of the last 20 years.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 213-7 (Styris LBW b Muralitharan 57)</strong> What a beautiful moment this is for Muttiah Muralitharan, who takes a wicket with his last-ever delivery on Sri Lankan soil. Styris went back in his crease and was trapped in front by some sharp spin; he referred it on a might-as-well basis, but replays showed it was hitting leg stump. That's a lovely way for this rubber-wristed genius to sign off at home, and it brings a little tingle to the spine. It might even be his last delivery in international cricket – although, at this stage, you'd bank on him having 60 more in Mumbai on Saturday.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>47th over: New Zealand 213-7 (Oram 6, Vettori 0)</strong> Murali also took a wicket, his 800th, with his last delivery in Test cricket. Who writes his scripts? He does, of course. He waves his cap proudly to all corners of the ground. What a pleasure it has been to watch him for the last 19 years. \"Speedball is now available on iPhone,\" says Charlie Talbot. \"Seems like the difficulty setting is too easy and there's a glitch in the way they add up the league points, but still: it's Speedball! On your phone. After they already did Monkey Island. Only missing Cannon Fodder now...\" An iWhat? They really should have stopped at the iPod. The rest are just toys for narcissists. Until I buy them, at which they become bloody important and praiseworthy technological advances.</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 215-8 (Oram c Jayawardene b Dilshan 7)</strong> Oram charges Dilshan and drags him straight to long on, where Jayawardene takes a comfortable catch. New Zealand are losing their way, just as England did.</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>48th over: New Zealand 216-8 (Vettori 2, Southee 0)</strong> Sri Lanka's bowlers are <em>so</em> good at the death. \"Punter eh?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Few non-Australians will be sad to see him go, since his appeal was so much narrower than that of a Lara, a Tendulkar or a Laxman. I'm afraid I'll remember him for those two iconic run-outs, so brilliantly captured by the cameras – Gary Pratt's fifteen minutes in 2005 and Fred the Redeemer in 2009. I know he's worth more than that, but not to me.\" I never thought I'd type or think these words, but: Naylor, you disappoint me. It's the sort of response I'd expect from an England football fan. But there's plenty of goodwill in the bank after five years of nail-on-head emails, so I'm sure this tumultuous, rewarding and defiantly homoerotic e-relationship of ours will survive.</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>WICKET! New Zealand 217-9 (Southee c Sangakkara b Mendis 0)</strong> Tim Southee is picked off easily by Ajantha Mendis, edging a legspinner into the safe hands of Kumar Sangakkara. The last five overs have surely won this match for Sri Lanka.</p><!-- Block 62 --><p><strong>WICKET! 48.5 overs. New Zealand 217 all out (McKay b Mendis 0)</strong> That's it. McKay is beaten all ends up by Mendis, and New Zealand have lost their last six wickets for 25 runs. While it's tempting to blame them, it was mainly the consequence of some glorious death bowling from Sri Lanka, and particularly the three Ms: Malinga, Murali and Mendis. They are just beautiful to watch, and they have given their batsmen what should be a pretty comfortable evening's work. Sri Lanka need just <strong>218 to win</strong>. See you in 20 minutes for their reply.</p><!-- Block 63 --><p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p><!-- Block 64 --><p><strong>1st over: Sri Lanka 6-0 (target: 218; Tharanga 6, Dilshan 0)</strong> Upul Tharanga may have decided to get 'em in sixes. He moves serenely down the track to the third delivery of the innings, from the offspinner Nathan McCullum, and drives it perfectly straight for six. That's a formidable statement of intent. \"Murali's career has of course had a shadow in terms his action,\" says Phil Marshall. \"John Reid, the ex-NZ captain was on the panel that reviewed this. I saw him speak on this once and he explained that Murali can bend his wrist back so far it touches his arm. That seems like a pretty good explanation of why he can so things that others can't. And yet I have never seen it mentioned in any discussion about his action. Wonder why that is.\" Are you saying we're all racists? Right, that's it! I'm going to sue me for publishing an email about me that suggested me might be a racist.</p><!-- Block 65 --><p><strong>2nd over: Sri Lanka 18-0 (target: 218; Tharanga 14, Dilshan 1)</strong> If New Zealand don't take early wickets, this game is over. Tim Southee's second ball brings a big LBW appeal against Dilshan, but it was clearly going down leg. When Dilshan gets a single, Tharanga plays a flowing cover-drive for four. He has picked up where he left off with that charming hundred against England. A flustered Southee responds by swinging one down the leg side for two wides, and then Tharanga times a gorgeous boundary through mid off for four. \"Re: Punter, I think I just got too used to his relentless batting style and, like the sequences of consecutive Test victories and World Cup games without defeat, his sheer, well, Pontingness, overpowered any sense of perspective,\" says Gary Naylor. \"He was a great winner for sure, but he was so much more memorable as a loser. The defeats will linger longer, much longer, in my mind which is, in a perverse way, a tribute to his excellence.\" Fair point. One thing about Ponting is that he was extremely gracious in defeat – not always during, but certainly after.</p><!-- Block 66 --><p><strong>3rd over: Sri Lanka 20-0 (target: 218; Tharanga 15, Dilshan 2)</strong> Dilshan charges McCullum again, but this time he drives him along the floor to mid off. \"Four for 100 lads, four for 100,\" parrots Brendon McCullum, and I don't think he's talking about an offer on Moet at Sainsbury's. Tharanga drives a single down the ground. \"I too <del>have made up</del> sent an eerily prescient email,\" says Steve Betteley, \"Mine was in, let's say, 1992 and I sent it to, why don't we say, Stefan Dennis. It read '<em>Dear Stefan, hope all is well with you and whichever twin you're supposed to be sleeping with at the moment. I know you've got a downer on this Warne fellow after his 1-150 on debut but I have to say I like what I see. He's got a bit about him and I can see him taking 700 wickets and generally changing the way spin bowling is regarded in world cricket. Not that it'll help you in the Ashes of course, you won't win for a decade or more now that Graeme Hick has qual</em>...' don't know how that last bit ended as it was deleted but, wow, I totally called that.\"</p><!-- Block 67 --><p><strong>4th over: Sri Lanka 24-0 (target: 218; Tharanga 18, Dilshan 4)</strong> Vettori replaces Southee, and Tharanga times him through the covers for a couple. Four from the over. \"With all this talk of Speedball I feel I should point out that the iAmiga app is on its way (an Amiga emulator for the iPhone),\" says Timothy King. \"Apparently it'll be released with loads of licensed games. Really looking forward to this even though it's going to be a total productivity disaster for me. Hoping Supercars 2 and Lotus 2 are on it.\" I've said it all along and I'll say it again: the iPhone is a bloody important and praiseworthy technological advance.</p><!-- Block 68 --><p><strong>5th over: Sri Lanka 29-0 (target: 218; Tharanga 22, Dilshan 4)</strong> As the chaps have just said on Sky, I'm not sure that opening with spin is the way to go against Sri Lanka – certainly not at both ends. Tharanga gives McCullum the charge and thrashes a boundary wide of mid off. It was in the air but struck flat, hard and wide of the fielder. He had it totally under control. \"I did not see any indication whatsoever in Phil Marshall's email of a racist assertion,\" says Roger Foster. \"This leads me to suspect one of two things. 1)  You are hyper sensitive to charges of racism, in which case I would say 'the gentleman doth protest too much'. 2)      You simply do not understand what being 'racist' means. In your case, this means that ignorance is an exculpating factor. Please don't blithely throw around loaded charges about racism. It's tacky.\" And there was me thinking the whole thing that me wrote was a joke. Silly old me. But you're right: racism is a difficult concept to grasp.</p><!-- Block 69 --><p><strong>6th over: Sri Lanka 34-0 (target: 218; Tharanga 25, Dilshan 6)</strong> Tharanga is batting like a dream, with everything coming off the middle. When he pushes at Vettori, the ball races through the covers for four, although he misses a fiddle at the next delivery. New Zealand are trying to bully Tharanga verbally; it worked against South Africa on Friday but Tharanga looks utterly unperturbed.</p><!-- Block 70 --><p><strong>7th over: Sri Lanka 40-0 (target: 218; Tharanga 30, Dilshan 6)</strong> New Zealand have got the Battle Fever on, sledging incessantly, but it feels a little contrived – not to mention cringeworthy, in view of the score. It's certainly not working. When McCullum gives Tharanga just a touch of width he flashes a lovely cut for four. He now has 30 from 29 balls. \"Since the Tendulkar v Ponting comparisons, I've rediscovered the joy that is the Reliance ICC player ratings/rankings,\" says Neil Withers. \"Looking at those batsmen you mentioned, here are their highest ratings: Ponting 942, Lara 911, Tendulkar 898, Waugh 895, Dravid 892. Also in the mix of recent vintage are Hayden+Kallis 935, M Yousuf 933, M Hussey 921, Pietersen 909. Considering a rating of 900+ normally reflects the kind of form that gets labelled 'Bradmanesque' (no-one is currently rated above 900 at the moment), I'm surprised that (a) Lara didn't peak higher than that and (b) Tendulkar hasn't made it to the 900s. When considering those batsmen, I'd put Lara first among equals because he was a genius - I don't think anyone has played like that before, or ever will. Tendulkar and Ponting are 'merely' nigh-perfect orthodox batsmen, and Waugh and Dravid 'merely' exceptionally mentally strong and took their slightly less technically good batting further than they should have. Lara was a magician. Like the difference between Feynman and other physicists of his generation.\" I suppose the thing with Lara is that <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/52337.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=series\">he always had bad periods</a>, so they would always impact. When was his highest rating? After the 375? After the Aussie Trilogy of 1998-99? After the Sri Lanka series in 2001-02?</p><!-- Block 71 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 40-1 (Tharanga c Ryder b Southee 30)</strong> Jesse Ryder has just taken an astonishing catch. Tharanga drove a wide delivery from Southee high to the left of backward point, and Ryder took a flying one-handed catch before assuming the Flintoff messiah pose. That was a breathtaking catch.</p><!-- Block 72 --><p><strong>8th over: Sri Lanka 46-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 11, Sangakkara 1)</strong> Dilshan pings a leg-stump half-volley from Southee through midwicket for four. As Barney Ronay to my left has just said, there were shades of Dwayne Leverock in that catch. This one was even better. Did the earth move for you? \"T'is a strange feeling,\" says John Davis. \"I'm an Englishman living in Oz, I'm supposed to boo and hiss at the Pantomime villain that is Punter, but the the guy has been one of the most naturally gifted batsman of his generation, a true sporting great, who for some reason doesn't tick some of the boxes that make him media-friendly. His treatment by the Aussie media has been nothing short of disgraceful. Once you are in the sights of the hacks you are dead in in the water, it is a strange mobius-strip-like self fulfilling prophecy, they will carp and whine and undermine until at last it actually causes you to under perform - a pox on all of them, and what a chance for us poms to show some class by giving him the appreciation that the guy deserves. (I'd still yell 'Gary Pratt' at him given half a chance though.)\" How true that point about the media is. I still can't get my head round this extraordinary Capello witch-hunt that is going on at the moment. It's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen. I didn't realise Ponting was subject to something similar; that's a great shame.</p><!-- Block 73 --><p><strong>9th over: Sri Lanka 46-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 11, Sangakkara 1)</strong> Jacob Oram comes into the attack, and his first over is a maiden to Dilshan. \"Moet at Sainsbury's is never on a 4 for 100 offer,\" says Dan Smith. \"This leads to be to suspect one of two things: (i) you do not appreciate the cachet of the Moet brand or (ii) you are too busy at the fish finger counter.  Please don't blithely throw around non-existent multi-buy promotions on premium drinks.  It's tacky.\"</p><!-- Block 74 --><p><strong>10th over: Sri Lanka 47-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 11, Sangakkara 2)</strong> New Zealand have a pretty big appeal for caught behind when Southee slips a good bouncer through Dilshan's attempted hook. They decide not to review, and replays show it hit the top of the helmet. Just from the last two overs, a great example of how wickets slow the scoring rate. \"In all seriousness Rob, I am genuinely perplexed by the fact that comment about Murali from John Reid,\" says Phil Marshall. \"Wondering how common that knowledge is? (Assuming Reid was correct, and no reason to think otherwise). On a completely different note, all the talk about South Africa's choke has seemed to underplay the fact that SA had Botha, Petersen and Steyn at 7, 8 and 9. Not exactly in the Boucher, Klusener, Pollock mould. With Malinga at 8 today, Sri Lanka will want to get a long way with their top 4. Which they probably will.\" Yes, the line-ups are very similar actually: a mighty top four, a slightly untried middle order, and a longish lower order. As for Reid, I had never heard it before, although a <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/nzvsl/content/story/273536.html\">quick Google search brings this up</a>.</p><!-- Block 75 --><p><strong>11th over: Sri Lanka 51-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 11, Sangakkara 6)</strong> Sangakkara, on the drive, edges Oram through the vacant slip area for four. \"Hello Smyth,\" says Bull. \"I'm procrastinating while I should really be working. I feel like a true OBO reader. Strange feeling. I felt compelled to write because of Withers' email in the 7th over of this innings. I used to think that Lara was the nonpareil too, just because his batting was so entrancing to watch. Magical, as Withers says. But seeing Sachin play in India these last few weeks has changed my thinking on that. Tendulkar's career has been played out under a pressure that surpasses that experienced by any other cricketer in the history of the game. The man has carried the hopes and expectations of a billion people for two decades. Nothing else in cricket can compare to it. Fans might have preferred to watch the likes of Lara, Viv and Blackwell but I really believe that when you consider the burden he carries, Tendulkar's achievements stand alone. PS: if anybody reading this is wondering where the Spin is, umm, it will be with you just as soon as I've got this very important work done. PPS While I'm wading in you can tell Phil Marshall that Peterson and Botha didn't look too shabby when they closed out South Africa's win against India with a stand of 32 in 23 balls.\" Yeah, I completely agree about Tendulkar. Twenty-two years of Being Sachin? It's mind-blowing.</p><!-- Block 76 --><p><strong>12th over: Sri Lanka 59-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 19, Sangakkara 6)</strong> The cautious way in which Sri Lanka have batted since the wicket – even the usually reckless Dilshan – tells you that they are conscious of that potentially fragile middle order. That said, some balls have to be struck for four, and two short deliveries from Southee get the treatment from Dilshan, with both pulled behind square for four. \"Roger Foster has blithely accused you in print of the loaded charge of racism,\" writes Kevin Toohey. \"Are you going to take him to court? I think you should take him to court. You'll coin it in.\" I could retire and just live at home, eating fish fingers, watching kooky indie films and sleeping 20 hours a day.</p><!-- Block 77 --><p><strong>13th over: Sri Lanka 62-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 20, Sangakkara 8)</strong> Three from Oram's third over. New Zealand need to get Sri Lanka three down as soon as possible and hope the pressure tells on batsmen who haven't had much work to do in the last 74 years, or however long this tournament has been going on. For now, however, Sri Lanka look very comfortable. \"Lara's highest was <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/64065.html\">v South Africa, 02/01/2004, after this</a>,\" says Neil Withers. And then came one of his worst series, against England, which kind of proves the point about ups and downs.</p><!-- Block 78 --><p><strong>14th over: Sri Lanka 63-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 20, Sangakkara 9)</strong> Vettori is back on, perhaps sensing that it's now or never. Sri Lanka, for their part, realise that they can just see Vettori off, so there's only a single from a low-key over. \"Four for 100 boys,\" says Brendon McCullum, and I don't think  he's talking about those ties that Nobby Burton sells.  \"Bull, you clearly have too much time on your hands,\" says Mike Selvey. \"If you've finished the silver, the Rolls needs a polish.\"</p><!-- Block 79 --><p><strong>15th over: Sri Lanka 67-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 20, Sangakkara 13)</strong> Oram overpitches a fraction, and that's enough for Sangakkara to lean into a gorgeous cover drive that goes for four. Sangakkara is then beaten by a good one that moves away late. \"Any chance <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/507513.html\">you could link to this</a>?\" says Pete Starkings. \"After a less than perfect World Cup campaign this is my piece on the bright side of cricket development in Kenya after the Cricket Without Boundaries Spring development project and more generally the role of Associates in future World Cups.\"</p><!-- Block 80 --><p><strong>16th over: Sri Lanka 70-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 22, Sangakkara 14)</strong> Vettori is New Zealand's main threat, a shade ahead of Oram, so there really is no need to do anything except milk him for singles. Predictably, then, Dilshan lines up a booming cut that he completely misses. \"Re: the bit at the end of the 12th over,\" begins Justin Spencer. \"Or you could just continue 'working' on OBO you feckless lummox!!\"</p><!-- Block 81 --><p><strong>17th over: Sri Lanka 73-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 24, Sangakkara 15)</strong> The left-arm seamer Andy McKay is coming into the attack, and he gets some reverse swing straight away. There's a pretty big shout for LBW against Sangakkara, but he was a fair way forward and it was swinging down leg. Three from a promising first over. \"Some media types are drawn to that work because they can use their power of the pen to bully and abuse,\" says Paul Szabo. \"Reminds me a little of Kevin Kline's tremendous lines from 'Life As A House' (although certainly not in as important a context):  'My dad used to play a game. I never really understood what it was until after he was gone. The game was to make me smaller than he was. No matter what. He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller. So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football. If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough. If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho. I never won the game. Not once.'\"</p><!-- Block 82 --><p><strong>18th over: Sri Lanka 76-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 26, Sangakkara 15)</strong> Dilshan cuts Vettori just short of Oram at backward point. That bounced more than he expected, but surely he should just be seeing Vettori off. Three singles from the over. \"As you well know Rob, I am not nor ever have been the greatest fan of Punter,\" says Clare Davies. \" However, I have been moved to comment on Lord Selve's piece with if not glowing praise then with the point that it won't be long before we are moaning on about blandness and longing for the return of Ponting's heart-on-sleeve passion and impulsive behaviour.  And the Aussie media are a disgrace.\"</p><!-- Block 83 --><p><strong>19th over: Sri Lanka 76-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 26, Sangakkara 15)</strong> Dilshan is going through one of those dodgy spells where he plays a false stroke every over, and he misses a cut at McKay's first ball. A maiden, and a little bit of pressure is mounting. Not much, but beggars/choosers and all that. \"A nice email,\" begins Luke Dealtry. \"Hi Rob- love your work! Keep it up, haters gonna hate- but you're above that, cos you're so good! By the way, can you please <em>focus on the cricket more and stop printing the stupid effing email </em>bits? Yeah?\"</p><!-- Block 84 --><p><strong>20th over: Sri Lanka 83-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 31, Sangakkara 17)</strong> Scott Styris replaces Daniel Vettori, and Dilshan pulls his second ball witheringly behind square for four. That's been his main scoring area so far, and in fact that boundary makes him the leading run scorer in the tournament ahead of It's All Jonathan Trott's Fault. \"Please tell M'Lud Selvey that I will crack on with his Rolls just as soon as I have finished reading about how he saved the Northern White Rhinoceros from extinction,\" says Bull. \"Also, the UN have called and want him to present his article on the Middle Eastern problem.\"</p><!-- Block 85 --><p><strong>21st over: Sri Lanka 87-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 31, Sangakkara 21)</strong>  Sangakkara times McKay down the ground for four, an unutterably beautiful stroke. There was nothing wrong with the delivery from McKay, who has bowled well and responds with five dot balls. \"A kind lady in my office has opened an old school tuck shop in a spare cupboard by her desk,\" says Oliver Maund. \"She did this as they removed the vending machines. The best bit is its not for profit, so we have prices to match the ye olde world vibe. Packet of crisps for 25p packet of trebor mints 15p a curly whirly 25p.\" How much for a comma? \"Monster Munch 25p and now they are bigger like they used to be I feel like a kid again! Put on half a stone in three weeks.\" Congratulations.</p><!-- Block 86 --><p><strong>22nd over: Sri Lanka 92-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 34, Sangakkara 22)</strong> Sangakkara has looked in princely form throughout this tournament, and at the moment he seems to have this chase completely under control. Five from Styris's over, all in singles. \"Fantastic,\" says Andrew Kelly. \"The OBO is getting the kind of messages that I thought were only left on the boards of Joy of Six or John Lanchester's Restaurant Reviews (you ever read them? Jesus…harsh does not come close).\" Nope, but I can imagine. We've not had any OBO death threats yet, at least. What's that line in The Social Network? \"You write your snide bullshit from a dark room because that's what the angry do nowadays.\" Still, such comments and emails are always fun to receive, especially after five weeks leering at 100 overs a day.</p><!-- Block 87 --><p><strong>23rd over: Sri Lanka 99-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 35, Sangakkara 28)</strong> Sangakkara flashes a wide ball from McKay through the covers for four more. He is playing ominously well. New Zealand have to get him in the next few overs or they will be going home. \"Really enjoying the debate around Tendulkar - Ponting - Lara this afternoon,\" says Tom Green. \"Just thought I'd add that I've always thought Ponting has had a little bit more to prove because he hasn't had the opportunity to score runs against the best bowling attack of his era - namely the Australian attack of McGrath, Warne etc. Your reputation immediately gets a (well-deserved) boost if you can A) score 153* to win an iconic Test match (Lara) or B) make 300 runs to win a Test in Australia (Dravid 2003-04). Can you or a reader think of any truly iconic innings of Ricky's where against all odds he's done the business?\" Old Trafford 2005 was a bona fide epic, albeit to save rather than win a Test. And I think there was a very good matchwinning hundred in South Africa early in the 2000s. I agree in principle, though, and this is the problem with judging any batsmen who played most of their Tests in their 2000s: they haven't had to face the fast-bowling attacks of the late 90s and, especially, one particular bowling attack in the early 80s. Then again, the reverse is true of spin.</p><!-- Block 88 --><p><strong>24th over: Sri Lanka 110-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 45, Sangakkara 29)</strong> Oram comes back into the attack. Dilshan pulls him mightily for six and then a fast-handed cover drive goes straight through Guptill for four. Sri Lanka are cruising to victory. \"My colleague (the only American cricket fan I've ever met, incidentally) has just persuaded me to take the day off to watch the India-Pakistan game tomorrow,\" says Akash Paun. \"Can anyone suggest a decent place to watch it in central London? Ideally somewhere near Trafalgar Square/Piccadilly Circus, but which is not the Sports Bar. Looking for somewhere quietish that'll be open for the start. And where they won't kick us out if we sit there for several hours nursing half a pint.\" Anyone? I might join you. Between me and you, I'm going to pull a sickie, put on my 1992 Pakistan shirt and some Joop and see how the day progresses.</p><!-- Block 89 --><p><strong>25th over: Sri Lanka 116-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 46, Sangakkara 34)</strong> Nathan McCullum, he of the groundbreaking, baldness-curing, all round brilliant caption above, returns to the attack and Sangakkara times a low full toss through midwicket for four. New Zealand know it's over. The aggression of an hour ago has gone, and Sri Lanka are moving smoothly to a second consecutive World Cup final. The last time to achieve that – apart from Australia, who have been in the last 12 – were England in 1987 and 1992. \"If you find the match so boring,\" begins Narayan, \"perhaps you could try changing that insipid caption you have there before asking us for emails to keep you entertained?\" I haven't used this phrase since I was about 14, but it seems a good time to bring it back. <em>What's your problem?</em></p><!-- Block 90 --><p><strong>26th over: Sri Lanka 120-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 51, Sangakkara 34)</strong> Dilshan reaches his fifty in fortuitous fashion, edging Oram to third man for four. He has played pretty responsibly today. \"Afternoon Rob,\" says Tom Taylor. \"Any chance of a quick Trolololo?\" Proof that you can <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwGFalTRHDA\">never have too much of a good thing</a>.</p><!-- Block 91 --><p><strong>27th over: Sri Lanka 129-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 51, Sangakkara 41)</strong> Sangakkara saunters down the track and chips McCullum for a beautiful straight six. He is playing remarkably well at the moment. It's like watching a batting machine, only a strikingly aesthetic one. \"Re: Bull's last email,\" begins Mike Selvey. \"Heather Mills is a tough act to follow but I think I might be giving her a run for her considerable money. Has anyone ever won more than one Nobel prize in the same year? I rather fancy Peace, Physics and Literature.\"</p><!-- Block 92 --><p><strong>28th over: Sri Lanka 137-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 59, Sangakkara 41)</strong>  An unusually filthy delivery from Vettori, a rank long hop, is pulled for four by Dilshan. \"Rob - the trouble with measuring Ponting and others' ascent to greatness by epic or iconic moments in key Tests can be trumped in an instant by VVS Laxman's countless (15?) or so crucial knocks,\" says Jonny Sultoon. \"And speaking of stylists+important knocks, why hasn't anyone mentioned Damien Martyn?\" His <em>annus mirabilis</em> of 2004 is criminally underrated, but history won't record him as a great batsman. Or will it? Interesting that the most beautiful batsmen of the last 20 years – Martyn, Mark Waugh and Laxman – only averaged in the low to mid 40s. In many ways, Sangakkara represents the best of both worlds, the aesthetic run machine.</p><!-- Block 93 --><p><strong>29th over: Sri Lanka 143-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 60, Sangakkara 46)</strong> Sangakkara brings up the hundred partnership with a stunning push-drive through extra cover for four off the bowling of Southee. He is playing some unbelievable strokes. It's death by silk. \"Dear Sri Lanka, please hurry up and get this over and done with one way or the other,\" says Kat Petersen. \"Thanks to British Summer Time (I assume), working ODI days (hours: 9 a.m. to last ball) has become decidedly less pleasant.\"</p><!-- Block 94 --><p><strong>30th over: Sri Lanka 147-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 64, Sangakkara 46)</strong> Sri Lanka are racing to victory. Dilshan rocks back to cut Vettori wide of short third man for four. \"Ah, but Sanga also played many more bullying innings vs weak opponents,\" says Jonny Sultoon. \"A veritable feast for him.\" Fair point, up to a point (he still <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/50710.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;opposition=2;opposition=3;opposition=4;opposition=6;opposition=7;orderby=default;template=results;type=batting\">averages 54 against the top six nations</a>). His lowest average against a single country is 40, against England, which proves... er, what were we talking about again?</p><!-- Block 95 --><p><strong>31st over: Sri Lanka 147-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 64, Sangakkara 46)</strong> A rare false stroke from Sangakkara, who pushes a slower ball back down the ground in the air but wide of the bowler Southee. \"You say Waugh, Martyn and Laxman were beautiful players as if it's beyond challenge?\" says Nicholas. \"Tendulkar, Lara and Hooper out-beauty those three.\" No I don't and no they don't, in my always humble opinion.</p><!-- Block 96 --><p><strong>32nd over: Sri Lanka 153-1 (target: 218; Dilshan 69, Sangakkara 47)</strong> Vettori drops short and Dilshan pulls yet again for four. That's his ninth over, and at least six of them have been pulled. Meanwhile Narayan, our friend from the 25th over, has a shock newsflash: Smyth isn't the new Shakespeare! \"The problem, Rob, is that you've taken Shakespeare all too seriously: brevity, wit and all that. Works with The Bard, a shade disappointing when you try it, though.\"</p><!-- Block 97 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 160-2 (Dilshan c Ryder b Southee 73)</strong> Dilshan slices a drive off Southee straight to backward point, where Ryder takes a routine catch.</p><!-- Block 98 --><p><strong>33rd over: Sri Lanka 161-2 (target: 218; Sangakkara 50, Jayawardene 1)</strong> Earlier in the over, Sangakkara timed Southee through square leg for three to reach an almost perfect half century, from 72 balls. His average for the tournament is now 137.67. \"Loth as I am to join in the general Smyth-bashing, I should probably point out that fortuitous doesn't mean fortunate, but random or aleatory, you witless, racist goon,\" says Matthew Carey. \"Although having said that, morons like you appear to be winning the battle and some online dictionaries now recognise your semi-literate (and frankly offensive) usage.\" Look, I'm no Shakespeare; deal with it.</p><!-- Block 99 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 161-3 (Jayawardene LBW b Vettori 1)</strong> Surely it's not happening again? Jayawardene pushes tentatively around his front pad at a straight one from Vettori and is given out LBW by Aleem Dar. That was the shot of a man who hasn't had a bat for a while. He reviewed the decision but that looked out, and replays showed it was hitting the top of leg stump.</p><!-- Block 100 --><p><strong>34th over: Sri Lanka 162-3 (target: 218; Sangakkara 50, Samaraweera 1)</strong> Samaraweera is beaten by his first delivery and then gets off the mark with an extra-cover drive that would have gone for four but for some brilliant fielding from Nathan McCullum. \"Noboby has won more than one Nobel Prize in the same year,\" says Ant Pease, \"but of the cross-discipline multiple winners, Madame Curie got a fantastic yet admittedly rather dull one-two with Physics and Chemistry. Linus Pauling's stellar performance with Chemistry and Peace was made all the more impressive when one considers that in his later years, he was batshit mental.\" Nobody has won more than one in the same year <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XCqtcFMomU#t=6m20s\"><em>yet</em></a>.</p><!-- Block 101 --><p><strong>35th over: Sri Lanka 167-3 (target: 218; Sangakkara 54, Samaraweera 2)</strong> Andy McKay returns after the mandatory ball change, and Sangakkara plays yet another exquisite stroke, this time a cover drive for four. He is in that small group of sportsmen whose heart would not skip a beat if you dropped a marmot in the bath, so those two wickets aren't going to bother him. \"I am not giving up,\" says Nicholas. \"Lara's square-drive, Hooper's late-cut and Tendulkar's straight-push vs Martyn's cover-drive, Waugh's on-drive and Lazman's flick through mid-wicket? Only one winner.\" I realise it's a controversial view to express on the nternet in this day and age, but it is possible for two grown men to have a different opinion without one of them deserving to be sacked/stoned/shoved in an airless room for 24 hours with only a Logic Problems book and a bucket.</p><!-- Block 102 --><p><strong>36th over: Sri Lanka 168-3 (target: 218; Sangakkara 54, Samaraweera 3)</strong> Sensible stuff from Samaraweera, who blocks Vettori's last over of the innings.  Vettori ends with figures of 10-0-36-1. \"If Shakespeare was writing the jokes for the OBO,\" says Charles Antaki, \"we'd have such side-splitters as 'Come! Thy shafts fall not in vain but too seemly the day!' or 'Marry, 'tis an ass that goes athwart and thus a simple ball betook!'. Always worth seeing the Bard in action.\"</p><!-- Block 103 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 169-4 (Sangakkara c Styris b McKay 54)</strong> A perfect silence descends on Colombo as Sangakkara falls. It was an odd end to a wonderful innings: he simply uppercut a short ball from McKay straight to third man. Sri Lanka should still be okay, but they are making this hard for themselves.</p><!-- Block 104 --><p><strong>37th over: Sri Lanka 169-4 (target: 218; Samaraweera 4, Silva 0)</strong> Samaraweera and Silva are both very good players; that's not in doubt. The trouble is that they have hardly had a hit all tournament, with only 160-odd runs between them.  \"My F grade O-level Chemistry probably lets me down a little on the Curie front,\" says Mike Selvey. \"But I'm still on for the others then, providing I can locate Higgs Boson (I'll do that easily by asking Ken where last he saw it and take it from there), get everyone together and thrash out the Middle East over a pint or two of Adnams, and knock off a Dan Brown.\"</p><!-- Block 105 --><p><strong>38th over: Sri Lanka 170-4 (target: 218; Samaraweera 5, Silva 0)</strong> This is a good move from Daniel Vettori, who has brought back Jacob Oram, his match-winner against South Africa. One more wicket and this will be very open, because Sri Lanka have a weak lower order. Just one from the over. \"As for pubs with Sky in the Piccadilly/Trafalgar Square area it's pretty slim pickings,\" says Ed Sutcliffe. \"The Comedy on Oxendon Street will have the cricket on, not sure whether I'd recommend it though.  I've nursed a lime soda and a packet of prawn cocktail there several times whilst on my lunch, I'm sure they don't mind.\"</p><!-- Block 106 --><p><strong>39th over: Sri Lanka 172-4 (target: 218; Samaraweera 6, Silva 1)</strong> Samaraweera and Silva are in no hurry. That's fair enough in terms of the required rate (just around four an over), but they need to be careful that they don't grind to a halt. In fact, Sri Lanka have scored only five off the last four overs. Silva is beaten by a good delivery from McKay, angled across him. On the balcony, the No8 Rangana Herath is padded up; that suggests there's a problem with Angel Mathews, who limped off towards the end of the New Zealand innings. \"The aesthetic greats of world batting have all been blessed with pure silky motion, but the most eye-massagingly beautiful stroke-player of my time was Robin Smith,\" says Ben Dunn. \"I'd wake up early just to see him send balls to the boundary at speeds hitherto unseen.  I'd go back to bed when he was bowled by a spinner, though.\" Statgasm department: the three countries against which Smith had the highest Test average were India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p><!-- Block 107 --><p><strong>40th over: Sri Lanka 174-4 (target: 218; Samaraweera 6, Silva 3)</strong> Oram galumphs in for his eighth over, and Silva cuts to third man before charging back to two. Those are the only runs from the over. Sri Lanka are struggling – that's seven from the last five overs – and The Fear is spreading all round the ground. \"Where's all the love gone?\" says Kristian Petterson. \"I blame Millings. Do you want me to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyK0y02HvVc\">unleash Keef</a> on the JCLs, Rob?\"</p><!-- Block 108 --><p><strong>41st over: Sri Lanka 176-4 (need 42 from 54 balls; Samaraweera 7, Silva 4)</strong> A low full toss from McKay misses Samaraweera's off stump by a whisker, and then the batsmen swap singles. Those are the only runs from another very good over from McKay. \"Enough of this talk of ratings and elegance,\" says Daniel Harris. \"If the heads of some of today's respondents were a cricket ball, who would you most like to be batting? I'd go for Klusener.\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOd9htAg5Xg#t=0m14s\">Case closed Columbo</a>.</p><!-- Block 109 --><p><strong>42nd over: Sri Lanka 185-4 (need 33 from 48 balls; Samaraweera 7, Silva 13)</strong> Jesse Ryder is coming on to bowl for the first time, which is a bit of a gamble. And it has backfired, with Silva taking consecutive boundaries from a cover drive and an open-faced steer. That over may have decided the match. \"The <a href=\"http://www.fancyapint.com/pubs/pub148.php\">Newton Arms in Holborn</a> is a good cricket pub,\" says Luke Dealtry. \"Yeah it looks rubbish – but it's usually got at least three screen showing cricket even when there's football on. And it's cheap enough to not have to be too intensive with your nursing. And the food is unreconstructed fare of the truest form. Lots of chips and grease. Mmmmmm I still wish I worked near there. Oh and it's <em>full </em>of masons - but don't worry, they'll not hurt you.\"</p><!-- Block 110 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 185-5 (Silva b Southee 13)</strong> Yet another twist in this fascinating match. Silva has a leaden-footed waft outside off stump at Tim Southee and drags the ball back onto his stumps. That's a poor stroke, and it has put Sri Lanka's lower order under huge pressure.</p><!-- Block 111 --><p><strong>43rd over: Sri Lanka 185-5 (need 33 from 42 balls; Samaraweera 7, Mathews 0)</strong> Angelo Mathews is the new batsman; he has a runner in Jayawardene because of the injury he sustained towards the end of the New Zealand innings, and he blocks the last four balls of the over. Sri Lanka's head have gone here. They should just have enough to get over the line, but their heads have gone. It's reminiscent of the West Indies' implosion in the 1996 semi-final. \"It wasn't spinners <em>per se</em> that got Smith, just one in particular,\" says Paddy Blewer. \"Also, an oft-forgotten thing was Smith's decline was largely brought on by injuries to his back and shoulder, which limited his flexibiility – not unlike what happened to Atherton, or even Botham's bowling.  Smith was one of the outstanding batsmen of his generation when he was fit. He was also a great fielder, with an arm that had to be seen to be believed. Exocet.\" He was also sadly mismanaged from the moment Micky Stewart left.</p><!-- Block 112 --><p><strong>44th over: Sri Lanka 190-5 (need 28 from 36 balls; Samaraweera 12, Mathews 0)</strong> Ryder continues, which is a bit of a surprise, and Samaraweera clouts his second ball over midwicket for four. Just one more single from the over, though, and the required rate is up to 4.67 per over. \"I'd go for Collis King,\" says Laurence Boyd. \"Amazing how quiet it goes here when there's a wicket, it's as if the crowd suck all the noise out of the ground. Very odd. The opposite of being on a covered terrace when there was a goal.\"</p><!-- Block 113 --><p><strong>45th over: Sri Lanka 196-5 (need 22 from 30 balls; Samaraweera 17, Mathews 1)</strong> Samaraweera times Southee's first ball through midwicket, and three runs become four because of an overthrow. That also gets Samaraweera back on strike, and he also works the fifth ball into the leg side, this time for a single. \"Earlier I sent an email that said I hoped Murali hits a six to win the match,\" says David Affleck. \"I have now revised that prediction: a six to tie.\"</p><!-- Block 114 --><p><strong>46th over: Sri Lanka 204-5 (need 14 from 24 balls; Samaraweera 18, Mathews 3)</strong> Sri Lanka <strong>take the batting Powerplay</strong> at the latest possible opportunity, although Vettori had the field up anyway. After a good start, Andy McKay slides a poor delivery down the leg side that bounces just in front of McCullum and scoots away for five wides. He responds with a beauty that zips through to Brendon McCullum as Mathews fences outside off stump. New Zealand think there's a nick, but Aleem Dar says not out so they <strong>go for the review</strong>. I don't think this can be given out. There's no noise and no real deviation, so <strong>Mathews survives</strong>.</p><!-- Block 115 --><p><strong>47th over: Sri Lanka 214-5 (need 4 from 18 balls; Samaraweera 18, Mathews 13)</strong> Angelo Mathews takes Sri Lanka to the brink of the World Cup final, driving Southee imperiously down the ground for six and then four.</p><!-- Block 116 --><p><strong>47.5 overs: Sri Lanka 220-5 (Samaraweera 23, Mathews 14); SRI LANKA WIN BY FIVE WICKETS WITH 13 BALLS REMAINING</strong> Samaraweera hits the winning runs off McKay, and Sri Lanka are into their second successive World Cup final. They were pretty comfortable victors in the end despite a nervous wobble, and Colombo's second all-night party in four days is under way. Congratulations to Sri Lanka – but also to the New Zealand, who have once again done their country proud at the cricket World Cup. Thanks for your emails; see you tomorow for India v Pakistan.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/3/29/1301399355039/Lasith-Malinga-celebrates-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/mar/29/cricket-world-cup-sri-lanka-new-zealand","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2011/mar/29/cricket-world-cup-sri-lanka-new-zealand","sectionName":"Sport"},{"webTitle":"FCO travel advice mapped: the world according to Britain's diplomats","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-23T08:30:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2011/mar/23/fco-travel-advice-map","fields":{"body":"<p>The world is a scary place right now; what with the Japan disaster and the Arab and Middle East unrest. Where's safe to go to? Well, for British citizens, the safety of foreign countries is ranked by the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office - the FCO.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/\">FCO regularly issues</a> travel advice for British citizens, telling them where is safe to go. It's obviously not the only foreign office in the world to do this - the <a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_1764.html\">US State Department does too</a>, for instance.</p><p>But the criteria are very different. The US issues 34 warnings for its citizens of places where </p><blockquote><p>the US Government's ability to assist American citizens is constrained due to the closure of an embassy or consulate or because of a drawdown of its staff.</p></blockquote><p>So, as well as dangerous places like Iraq, it includes countries like North Korea or Iran, which have no US embassy.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The UK's definition is broader. It covers 53 countries where either no travel at all or essential travel only - to the whole country or part of it - is recommended. It's all about safety. The definition means there are no restrictions on travelling to North Korea for instance - it just doesn't take account of whether or not you'll actually be able to get there.</p><p>We thought it would be interesting to take a snapshot of those ratings - reflecting the turmoil in the world today. You can see the result above using Google Fusion tables - you may be able to do better (we had problems mapping Gaza and the West Bank, for instance). </p><p>It's a fascinating picture - not only of the UK's world view - but also of conflict, disaster and terror in the world today.</p><p>There are a load of caveats. Many of the warnings are against travel to specific regions - a distinction you won't see on the map above. That includes countries like Russia, for instance - where the FCO advises against travel to regions caught up in violence, such as Chechnya or North Ossetia. The FCO also combines Israel and the Palestinian Occupied territories into one travel bulletin.</p><p>You can download the <a href=\"#data\">full data below</a>.

risks trailing in high-speed mobile internet race, warns Ofcom chief","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-22T19:08:05Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2011/mar/22/high-speed-mobile-internet-ofcom","fields":{"body":"<p>The UK risks being a laggard in the race to build high-speed mobile internet unless operators drop legal threats over Britain's digital infrastructure, the communications regulator has warned.</p><p>Ed Richards, Ofcom's chief executive, on Tuesday outlined plans for its largest auction to date of mobile phone spectrum, with the aim of enabling high-speed wireless internet around the UK. The rights to \"fourth generation\" (4G) radio spectrum – which enables connections at speeds of up to 100Mbps, about 25 times faster than the average broadband connection now in use at home – will be auctioned in 2012.</p><p>The disposal will give access to 80% more radio spectrum than was sold in 2000, when the 3G spectrum was auctioned for £22bn. But the price is expected to be far lower this time because two of the incumbents, Vodafone and O2, have substantial amounts of radio spectrum.</p><p>Many Britons will have to wait until at least 2014 to enjoy the benefits of 4G mobile internet because of the time and expense involved in building the new systems. That could be further delayed if Everything Everywhere, the UK's largest mobile operator, formed by a merger of Orange and T-Mobile, goes ahead with a legal challenge to Ofcom's proposals.</p><p>\"Do I wish that we hadn't had any dispute and debate and delay? Of course I do, but let's be realistic,\" Richards urged on Tuesday. \"This is a massive debate of huge economic importance to a lot of very powerful companies and of huge importance to the country. We shouldn't be surprised or uncomfortable that there is a rigorous and thorough debate. This matters to people, it matters to companies, it matters to us, it matters to consumers.\"</p><p>Other countries including South Korea, Sweden, Denmark, the US, Russia, Germany, Kenya, Nepal and Australia either have 4G networks, or will develop them by the end of this year. But Richards said: \"I don't accept we're laggards. But I think there is a danger if we don't move in a timely way that we become laggards. Others have already started moving now and we do not want to fall any further behind.\"</p><p>Two of the UK's mobile operators, 3 and Everything Everywhere, protested in January after Ofcom allowed the two older networks, O2 and Vodafone, to \"re-farm\" low-frequency spectrum that they had been allocated when the mobile networks were first set up in the 1980s for 3G connections. Low-frequency bandwidth around the 800MHz mark is highly sought after as it is more effective for connections over long distances such as in rural areas. The bandwidth is being released by the \"digital switchover\" from analogue to digital TV signals across the UK.</p><p>Tom Alexander, the chief executive of Everything Everywhere, said on Tuesday that while Ofcom's new proposals provide \"partial solutions\" to its complaints, \"we are concerned that the proposals … do not significantly reduce the dominance\" of Vodafone and O2, which own all of the low-frequency bandwidth below the 1GHz mark, giving them better coverage in rural areas. The company said it would outline its opposition to the plans to Ofcom, but would not go into further detail.</p><p>Kevin Russell, chief executive officer of 3 UK, said: \"Ofcom's proposals set out the core principle that the UK must retain four wholesale mobile operators. Against a background of consolidation in the UK and US, we believe this is a clear and strong commitment from government and Ofcom that will stimulate investment in mobile broadband and protect UK consumers.</p><p>\"The January 2011 reallocation of 2G spectrum has given a huge competitive advantage to Vodafone, O2 and Everything Everywhere. Ofcom's proposals seek to rebalance this in the medium term but there are still immediate distortions that need to be addressed. These include significant coverage, capacity and financial benefits.\"</p><p>Richards said: \"I hope that all [operators] recognise that the UK needs to move on with this now and accept that a judgment's got to be made. What I hope doesn't happen is that the debate spills over into litigation because that will delay the award [of the spectrum after the auction] and then there is only one loser – the British consumer.\"</p><p></p><h2>Why low frequency matters<br /></h2><p>Ofcom intends to auction off the radio spectrum for the next-generation 4G networks in pairs of bandwidth: some chunks below 1 gigahertz (1,000 megahertz) paired with others either at 1.8GHz or 2.6GHz. That's because to mobile operators both are desirable, but in different ways. The low-frequency spectrum gives excellent coverage across large distances, in the same way that a large swell travelling through the sea isn't diverted by breakwaters.</p><p>Vodafone and O2 were the original phone networks in the UK (when O2 was BT Cellnet), and so were allocated spectrum in the 900MHz band; later allocations were at higher frequencies. That's why customers of those two networks can get voice signals where Three, Orange and T-Mobile can't.</p><p>The high-frequency spectrum, meanwhile, allows really fast connections, but only over comparatively short distances – so in cities, where you want an intensive data connection, it would be ideal.</p><p>What 3 and Everything Everywhere (Orange/T-Mobile) find galling is that in January the government instructed Ofcom to hand over that 900MHz spectrum to Vodafone and O2 for free. The rivals think it should have either been auctioned, or at least paid for on the basis of its potentially huge value for reaching customers outside cities. That leaves them at a disadvantage to start with – and is part of the reason why this auction will not raise anything like the £22bn that the 3G one did, despite having more spectrum and, arguably, being more useful.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/22/1300813950972/Ed-Richards-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/22/high-speed-mobile-internet-ofcom","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2011/mar/22/high-speed-mobile-internet-ofcom","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Ugandan scientists grow GM banana as disease threatens country's staple food","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-09T00:01:00Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2011/mar/09/gm-banana-crop-disease-uganda","fields":{"body":"<p>Most countries would resent being called a banana republic. Uganda prides itself on it. A typical adult here eats at least three times his or her body weight in bananas each year, more than anywhere else on Earth. Different varieties are steamed, boiled, roasted, turned into gin and beer, or simply peeled and eaten raw, such as the tiny <a href=\"http://www.bioline.org.br/abstract?cs03011\" title=\"\"><em>sukali ndizi</em></a>, considered by some experts to be finest banana in the world.</p><p>\"Breakfast, lunch and dinner, 365 days a year,\" said Arthur Kamenya, whose taste for the fruit is so strong he quit his job as a graphic designer to grow it commercially. \"And people still crave more.\"</p><p>But it is a craving under threat. In recent years a devastating bacterial disease has swept across Uganda and, to a lesser extent, neighbouring countries, causing annual banana crop losses to the region of more than $500m (£310m). The rapid spread of banana <a href=\"http://www.promusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66\" title=\"\">Xanthomonas wilt</a>, or BXW, which destroys the entire plant and contaminates the soil, \"has endangered the livelihoods of millions of farmers who rely on banana for staple food and income\", according to <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00639.x/abstract\" title=\"\">an article in the journal Molecular Plant Pathology</a> last year.</p><p>With no resistant varieties or chemical cures available, growers such as Kamenya have been forced to destroy large sections of their plantations. For smaller farmers the damage has been so severe many have given up on the fruit.</p><p>But local scientists have not. On a sprawling campus outside Kampala, Wilberforce Tushemereirwe and his colleagues at the <a href=\"http://www.banana.go.ug/\" title=\"\">National Banana Research Programme</a> have been on a quest to defeat the disease by building a better banana. This has involved adding to the fruit a sweet pepper gene that has already improved disease resistance in several vegetables.</p><p>Laboratory tests on the genetically modified bananas have been highly promising, with six out of eight strains proving 100% resistant to BXW. Field tests have now started in a fenced-off, guarded plot on the edge of the campus.</p><p>Results from the trials, expected later this year, could have a strong bearing on the country's future food security – and indeed its entire policy on agriculture. GM crops are still banned in Uganda, and the scientists had to get special permission just to conduct their tests. While acknowledging that it is a highly controversial topic, Tushemereirwe says the risk of doing nothing is too great.</p><p>\"If we just leave this, bananas will slowly disappear from Uganda,\" he said.</p><p>BXW was first reported in Ethiopia in the 1960s, but was only identified further south in 2001, initially in Uganda and then Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Burundi and Tanzania. Uganda was particularly vulnerable because of the scale of its banana production, second only to India which has a population 35 times larger.</p><p>With a single plant lasting for many years and providing a large bunch of fruit every few months, bananas are a key crop for small farmers. They are also a crucial source of sustenance, accounting for more than 30% of Ugandans' daily calorie intake. According to Tushemereirwe, the average adult eats 200-250kg (440lb-550lb) of bananas a year – and twice that in some areas.</p><p>Most of that is <a href=\"http://www.ugandatourism.org/Uganda%20on%20a%20plate.php\" title=\"\">matooke, a long green banana</a>, which is usually steamed and mashed and eaten with beans, peanut sauce or meat. That's what Kamenya planted six years ago on his farm in Galamba, about an hour's drive from the Ugandan capital. But soon he realised some of the plants were sick, with yellowing leaves and the fruit ripening prematurely.</p><p>Kamenya, a powerfully built 37-year-old, was forced to dig up 1,500 of his 4,500 plants, destroy them, and allow the soil to lie fallow for at least six months. He also had to sterilise his farm tools. This eventually helped control the disease, though he still has problems. \"Look how this plant has rotted,\" he said, slicing through the trunk of a banana plant with a knife to reveal yellow ooze.</p><p>Few areas of Uganda have escaped the disease, which is transported by insects such as bees and wasps. But traditional farming practices also ensured its rapid spread. Infected \"suckers\" – young shoots of banana plants – are shared with neighbours, while the use of banana leaves to cover bunches of fruit headed to market quickly transferred the disease to new areas.</p><p>In central Uganda, one of the main banana-growing regions, BXW hit up to 80% of farms, sometimes wiping out entire fields. Small-scale farmers, who could not afford to let their gardens lie empty for months before replanting, switched to other crops.</p><p>Tushemereirwe, with the <a href=\"http://www.iita.org/\" title=\"\">International Institute for Tropical Agriculture</a> (IITA) and <a href=\"http://www.aatf-africa.org/\" title=\"\">African Agricultural Technology Foundation</a> (AATF), decided a GM solution was the best way forward. <a href=\"http://www.sinica.edu.tw/main_e.shtml\" title=\"\">Academia Sinica</a>, the Taiwanese research institute that pioneered the sweet pepper gene technology, agreed to issue them with a royalty-free licence. The sweet pepper gene – successfully transplanted into the other vegetables, but never before a banana – produces a protein that kills cells infected by disease-spreading bacteria.</p><p><a href=\"http://r4dreview.org/2008/09/leena-tripathi-looking-after-the-welfare-of-smallholder-banana-growers/\" title=\"\">Leena Tripathi</a>, a plant biotechnologist at IITA who helped steer the project, said introducing the gene did not affect the quality of the banana and presented no health risks. \"The beauty of the genetic engineering is that you can be very precise,\" she said.</p><p>Other GM banana experiments are under way in Uganda, including one to fortify the fruit with iron and vitamin A. But concern about GM foods in Uganda means they could face a long battle before any of the transgenic bananas find their way on to the market.</p><p>A study by Enoch Kikulwe, assistant professor of international food economics at the University of Göttingen, Germany, revealed more opposition to GM crops among the elite than those in poorer villages. Most studies show that better education led to more acceptance of GM foods, he said.</p><p>But for Kamenya the farmer, – who falls into the elite category – the anti-GM stance was hypocritical. \"Most of the people against this have choices,\" he said, a pot of matooke steaming nearby. \"Somebody who is hungry does not have a choice. GM, organic or whatever – you have to feed the people.\"</p><h2><strong>How to eat them, Uganda style</strong></h2><p>The super-sweet dessert bananas are the easy option. The home-brewed banana gin is a choice for only the highly adventurous. For authenticity, however, matooke, the national staple that looks like buttery mashed potato on the plate, is the only way to go.</p><p>Also known as east African highland bananas, the green matooke fruits are for cooking only – ideally steamed on an open fire. To start, water is poured into a large pot and covered with banana stalks. The peeled bananas are wrapped in the plant leaves, with the bundle lowered into the pot, resting on the stalks, above the water.</p><p>The fruit is then steamed for a few hours, going from hard to soft, white to yellow. Still wrapped in the leaves, the bananas are then mashed.</p><p>The dish can then be served on a new leaf, together with beans, other vegetables or peanut sauce.</p><p>It is an acquired taste, and to the uninitiated it can seem heavy and bland. But once you've got it, Ugandans say, there's no going back to rice and potatoes.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/8/1299608248116/Arthur-Kamenya-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/09/gm-banana-crop-disease-uganda","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/09/gm-banana-crop-disease-uganda","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Juliana Rotich | Top 100 women","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-08T00:06:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2011/mar/08/juliana-rotich-100-women","fields":{"body":"<p>Born in Kenya, and with an IT degree from the university of Missouri,Rotich, 33, co-founded a revolutionary website, <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com\" title=\"Ushahidi.com\">Ushahidi.com</a>, that harnesses the internet's power to uncover violence.

After that wondrous match on Sunday we are now seeing England through different eyes, as potential winners of this World Cup, and as such it would nice if they did what potential winners do: pulverise the Associate sides.</p><p>That won't be easy, partly because Ireland are a doughty and canny team, and partly because England often struggle in these fixtures. They were ruthless in early World Cups, defenestrating East Africa by 196 runs in 1975 and Canada by eight wickets (and with a mere 277 balls remaining) in 1979. But their next match against a non-Test-playing nation brought that infamous defeat to Zimbabwe in 1992, and since then they have had unconvincing wins over the Netherlands (1996 and last week), Namibia (2003), Canada (2007) and Ireland (also 2007).</p><p>England won that last match, when Ed Joyce played for England and Eoin Morgan for Ireland, by 48 runs. The same kind of result wouldn't be a surprise today. It might be a case of after the Lord Mayor's show (or after the Lord Brockett show).</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>Toss and team news dept</strong> England have won the toss and will bat first, which is a bit of a surprise givenhow well they have chased in the tournament thus far. Andrew Strauss's side make one change from the side that tied with India, with Stuart Broad replacing Ajmal Shahzad. Which means James '9.5-0-91-1' Anderson survives. Ireland tinker too, bringing Gary Wilson in for Andre Botha.</p><p><strong>England</strong> Strauss (c), Pietersen, Trott, Bell, Collingwood, Prior (wk), Yardy, Bresnan, Swann, Broad, Anderson.<br /> <br /><strong>Ireland</strong> Porterfield (c), Stirling, Joyce, N O'Brien (wk), White, K O'Brien, Wilson, Mooney, Johnston, Dockrell, Rankin.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>1st over: England 7-0 (Strauss 1, Pietersen 6)</strong> Boyd Rankin, the huge Warwickshire seamer, opens the bowling. It's a decent first over, although Pietersen makes it an expensive one with an imperious shot off the last delivery, timing a perfectly decent ball through midwicket for four. Anyone out there? <strong>WAKE UP!</strong></p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>2nd over: England 11-0 (Strauss 4, Pietersen 7)</strong> There was some suggestion that Ireland might open the bowling with the excellent George Dockrell, because of Kevin Pietersen's troubles against left-arm spin, but in fact it's Trent Johnston to bowl his right-arm seam-up. A quiet over brings four runs, but no boundaries. \"The Beard Liberation Front, the informal network of beard wearers, has updated its Cricket World Cup Beard Index to chart the influence of hirsute influence on the tournament and says Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga is in the lead with a rating of 8.3 after his bowling display against Kenya,\" writes Keith Flett. \"BLF Organiser Keith Flett said This is a new way of charting the influence of hirsute players in a major tournament and we feel that it could be decisive.\" I still can't believe Ed Joyce isn't on the longlist.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>3rd over: England 22-0 (Strauss 6, Pietersen 16)</strong> Pietersen looks right in the mood. He takes consecutive boundaries off Rankin with an inside-edge through square leg and a sumptuous push down the ground, and then Strauss times a couple through midwicket. Good start from England. \"If England's problems until now have been largely mental – their perception of themselves has until recently been that they're not good enough – is their problem in these Associate games still one of perception, in that the other team still perceive England as beatable?\" says Alex Netherton.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>4rd over: England 27-0 (Strauss 10, Pietersen 17)</strong> Strauss throws the bat at a short, wide delivery from Johnston and it flies off the edge for four. As Mac Millings always says: if you're going to flash, flash hard. \"What's KP going to do here?\" wonders William Hardy. \"Surely a perfect opportunity to show he's in good nick against a relatively pedestrian attack, or a lapase of concentration because it's not a 'big' enough game for him?\" I've given up trying to guess what Pietersen will do; you're almost on safer ground with Pakistan. Although he has started with swaggering intent and has 17 from 11 balls.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>5th over: England 34-0 (Strauss 16, Pietersen 18)</strong> Boyd Rankin has an extraordinary haircut: in parts it's blond, in others yellow, and there's also a bit of grey sneaking through. Strauss top-edges a pull and it <em>just</em> carries over the rope for six at fine leg. For a long time it looked like he would be out but it kept on going. \"Morning Rob,\" says Guy Hornsby. \"I've been looking forward to this morning all week. So far I've had a shocker at work, and this will serve as my oasis of (theoretical) calm while everything else goes west around me. This is why England will hit 350 for four  today and win by 170 runs. Because if they don't, and it goes like the Netherland game, I'll probably have a coronary. No pressure then.\" Remember when that little brat from The Sixth Sense sued God on Ally McBeal? The way society is going, it can't be long before someone sues a sportsman because, y'know, they made them a bit upset.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>6th over: England 40-0 (Strauss 17, Pietersen 23)</strong> A rare poor ball from Johnston, drifting onto the pads, is pinged through square for leg for four by Pietersen. This is an excellent start, who have thankfully left their Powerplay batting tactics from 2007 behind. \"Why do they keep talking up Stuart Broad's batting in saying he adds depth to the batting order?\" writes my colleague Martin Rose. \"In 75 ODIs he averages just 12.82 and has a top score of 45 which was three and a half years ago. And that average is boosted considerably by a number of not outs.\" I never really fancy Broad in a tight run-chase, whereas I definitely fancy Bresnan and, to an extent, Shahzad.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>7th over: England 46-0 (Strauss 20, Pietersen 24)</strong> Kevin O'Brien may have suffered a bad knee injury here. He slipped while fielding the ball and immediately waved his hands in pain. It was similar to Dwayne Bravo the other day, but thankfully I don't think he has done the same damage. After a bit of treatment he is going to continue. \"Is Strauss a potential World Cup winner?\" says Lee Calvert. \"Well his stats in ODIs over the last year - 24 innings, 1,235 runs, average 53.69, strike rate 95.58, three hundreds and nine fifties – certainly suggest so.  That's better figures than any other opener in this format during the same period, I believe.\" His improvement as a one-day batsman is so admirable. Remember when we said he only had three shots: cut, pull, drive. Now he has a million shots. You have to salute that ability – and also the humility to change his game so dramatically after the age of 30. Strauss is just a class act in every respect.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>8th over: England 50-0 (Strauss 22, Pietersen 26)</strong> Four singles in Johnston's over. You're all very quiet. Heavy night last night? It's \"Rob, <a href=\"http://www.cricket365.com/news/story/6787253/Ireland-dye-and-shave-heads-for-charity\">did you see this article</a>?\" says Mike McCarthy. \"The Ireland team have shaved their heads or dyed them for charity. Probably explains why they look part Army, part Romania '98 World Cup squad.\"</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>9th over: England 60-0 (Strauss 27, Pietersen 31)</strong> The medium-pacer Alex Cusack replaces Boyd Rankin, and his first ball is glided classily to third man for four by Strauss. Pietersen then crunches another boundary through extra cover. Only once before have England made 300 in consecutive ODI innings; they've got a helluva chance today. That said, they almost lost Strauss to the last delivery of Cusack's over when he fiddled a short one just short of the diving forward at short midwicket. Too many shorts in that sentence. Poor writing. \"I'm really not sure what to hope for today,\" says Declan Johnston. \"I'm leaving for a trip to St Petersburg from Moscow round about the innings break. If it's all wrapped up and England have scored 300+ I'll be disappointed but it won't be on my mind. However if Ireland are in with a shout it could be a very long, jittery journey! Curse cricket and its infernal hope-engendering nature! \"</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>10th over: England 72-0 (Strauss 28, Pietersen 42)</strong> Regal stuff from Pietersen, who dismisses a slower ball from Johnston over mid on for six. Strauss then came back for a tight two and would have been well out had the throw from the deep hit the stumps. Twelve from the over and, as on Sunday, this is excellent, controlled Powerplay batting from England. (The first Powerplay that is; we know what happens in the batting Powerplay.) \"It was a big night last night, my birthday!\" hics Kate. \"After abstaining from alcohol for all of February, the first glass of champagne went down a treat at 5pm. Even after two bottles I did not really have a hangover today. I just fancy Broad, run chase or no run chase.\"</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>11th over: England 77-0 (Strauss 29, Pietersen 46)</strong> Ireland take their bowling Powerplay straight away, and Pietersen lifts Cusack over midwicket for four more. \"You fancy Bresnan?\" sniffs Martin Sinclair. \"Urgh….\" LAD.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>12th over: England 85-0 (Strauss 31, Pietersen 51)</strong> Here comes George Dockrell, this exciting teenage spinner. After a few singles, Pietersen walks down the track and flicks beautifully wide of mid-on for four. That brings up a masterful fifty, his first as an opener, from 40 balls. \"It's my birthday today too,\" says Jo Beasley. \" So if England perform pants, lie please, there's a good lad.\" 'Perform pants'? Have you started celebrating already?</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>13th over: England 89-0 (Strauss 34, Pietersen 52)</strong> John Mooney, another medium pacer, replaces Alex Cusack and has an optimistic shout for LBW against Strauss. It was going down. \"Opportunistic begging for another plug, even if only in pity, of our <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPx_zhNUzMo \">first World Cup vid</a>,\" says Sam Collins. \"Tooting ice cream stores, a box, Russian cricket, tour photos and a phone box. Filming our second one today...\" Whereabouts? Actually, don't tell us; there'd be Beatlemania.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 91-1 (Strauss b Dockrell 34)</strong> Having so many new shots is generally a good thing for Andrew Strauss, but not in this instance. He jumps right across his stumps and tries to work Dockrell to fine leg, but succeeds only in dragging the ball onto middle stump. It looked horrible, although it would be unfair to berate Strauss. We can't have our unorthodoxy and eat it. Strauss has gone for 34 on his 34th birthday, and a quick google of the number 34 brings up this <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6408927/Internet-rules-and-laws-the-top-10-from-Godwin-to-Poe.html\">bizarre little rule</a>.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>14th over: England 92-1 (Pietersen 53, Trott 1)</strong> \"Out of respect to England's opponents in today's o'DI,\" begins Ant Pease, \"could we refer to this report as the o'BO?\" O' dear.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>15th over: England 107-1 (Pietersen 59, Trott 10)</strong> Trott skims consecutive wide deliveries from Mooney wide of point for four – the first driven, the second cut – and then Pietersen pulls witheringly over midwicket for six. \"Power!\" screams Mark Nicholas in the commentary box. \"Massive power!\" Fifteen from the over. \"Rob, I have to say that, despite his boyish good looks and insouciant smile, I don't fancy Broad in tights, whether they are run or not,\" says Luke Williams. \"Same applies to Bresnan and Shazad, although I do know a girl called Sheherazade whom I fancy like nobody's business.  I can say that in all safety here; she won't be following, being French and all. \"PS If any of my Irish chums who also know Shera are reading this, it's not true.  I have deliberately overstated the case to try and get published...\" Schyeah.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>16th over: England 110-1 (Pietersen 59, Trott 13)</strong> A good over from Dockrell costs just three. His figures are 3-0-14-1. \"Seems to me the best way to negotiate the dreaded batting Powerplay would be to take it immediately after the bowling one,\" the Richard Marsden. \"It's a strategy I'm calling MMMS - 'Minimise the Mental Momentum Shift'.\" I don't know about the strategy but the name's a keeper.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 111-2 (Pietersen c N O'Brien b Stirling 59)</strong> It's 1987 all over again, as an England batsman falls to the reverse sweep in a World Cup match. It was the last ball of the offspinner Paul Stirling's first over, and Pietersen's shot looped gently up in the air for the wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien to catch. That's a tame end to a fine innings and, while some folk will criticise Pietersen, I don't think we should.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>17th over: England 111-2 (Trott 13, Bell 0)</strong> It's an interesting debate: should we criticise Strauss and Pietersen for the manner of their dismissals? I think it's a wee bit harsh to celebrate the unorthodoxy and then moan when it occasionally goes wrong.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>18th over: England 114-2 (Trott 17, Bell 0)</strong> Ireland's spinners are gently squeezing the innings now, with just three from that Dockrell over.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>19th over: England 118-2 (Trott 20, Bell 1)</strong> Four from Stirling's over. In other news, a World Cup wouldn't be a World Cup <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/mar/02/andrew-flintoff-cricket-return\">without an Andrew Flintoff story</a>.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>20th over: England 122-2 (Trott 23, Bell 2)</strong> John Mooney replaces George Dockrell (4-0-17-1). I suppose Ireland want to sneak a couple of cheap overs in while England are relatively becalmed, and save Dockrell for later on. Four from that over, all in ones and twos. \"Can't believe that you didn't know about rule 34,\" says Alec Cochrane. \"Rule 35 is of course the associated rule that runs the exceptions. I think that there should be a new rule that if Rob Smyth is doing OBO then there will be wickets.  For want of a better number I shall assign this rule 177 because it looks a bit like a wicket. A prize to the first person to put this in the urban dictionary.\"</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>21st over: England 126-2 (Trott 25, Bell 4)</strong> Stirling beats the driving Trott with a nice slider. Four singles from a good over. \"Re: Strauss and Pietersen,\" begins Phil Withall. \"'<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf7aw_b4wnU#t=1m40s\">I guess that's the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin' itself</a>'.\" Sometimes you eat the reverse sweep, and sometimes the reverse sweep eats you.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>22nd over: England 130-2 (Trott 27, Bell 6)</strong> Four singles from Mooney's over. I don't think anyone has ever mentioned this before – and this is probably a bit of an outlandish suggestion – but the middle overs of 50-over matches can be quite boring sometimes, can't they? \"Up THE BOYS IN GREEN!\" says Maggie Hopkinson. \"The Irish bread brand Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien doesn't seem to have cashed in on its cricketing namesakes' fame in their ads. O'pportunity missed.\"</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>23rd over: England 138-2 (Trott 33, Bell 8)</strong> Paul Stirling is a smart, streetwise bowler and again dupes Trott with the slider; this time it flies off the edge for four.<br />\"I have made a life-changing decision to open a brewery,\" because Ian Copestake, \"so I can<br />produce a beer and call it Minimise the Mental Momentum Shift.\" I would love to produce my own beer. Per se, but specifically so I could sell a pint of MJ McCague (or 72 of them – little McCague in-joke for all his fans out there) and a pint of Liver Compromiser and also a pint of Temporary Happiness Facilitator. Any other suggestions?</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>24th over: England 143-2 (Trott 34, Bell 12)</strong> I have no idea how England avoided a run out there. Bell worked Mooney through square leg and came back for a second even though Trott had only jogged the first. Trott eventually set off but would have been in all sorts of trouble had the throw gone to the bowler's end. Instead it went to the keeper's end, where Bell was just home, and by the time it was then relayed to the bowler's end Trott was also just home. \"We're into the BMOs aren't we?\" says Guy Hornsby, who also has strong views on bears, woods, the Pope and catholicism. \"It's only a matter of time before local tv starts sponsoring them. '<em>Welcome to the Boring Middle Overs, brought to you, by Whammo Energy Drink - keeping you awake until the batting Powerplay</em>.' I'd give it a week before that's in. What was that coffee you drank in the Ashes? I'd get on the phone right now. There's a danger that Trott and Bell will lose all the momentum here as well. Still, if we're 230 for two at 40 overs then 300 will be will within our grasp.\"</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>25th over: England 144-2 (Trott 34, Bell 13)</strong> Another Stirling over, another slider that beats Trott, this time on the reverse sweep. One from the over, and Stirling's figures are excellent: 5-0-18-1. \"Nathan Barley Wine\" suggests Alex Netherton. You could serve watered-down Lambrini as Nathan Barley Wine and charge £30 a glass.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>26th over: England 152-2 (Trott 36, Bell 19)</strong> Alex Cusack replaces John Mooney and the hitherto becalmed Bell – 14 off 26 balls – gets his first boundary with a delicious chip over mid on that lands just short of the rope. \"My charming (sorry, 'charming') boyfriend, who lives in rural Wales, brews his own beer and it has turned out to be both easy and satisfying, particularly the bit where you have to find a way to come by lots of empty beer bottles,\" says Jessie Greengrass. \"He also makes various kinds of near-lethal wine in demijohns which sit on the window sill and bubble alarmingly, and a spirit, which tastes for no fathomable reason of vanilla, and which I have christened 'Mind Remover'.\" And to think Karen O said there was no modern romance.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>27th over: England 159-2 (Trott 43, Bell 19)</strong> Ireland bring the field in, even though we're not in a Powerplay, in an attempt to reduce the number of singles. And so it does, with only one in that over. Sadly for Ireland there was also a two and a four, driven sweetly over mid on by Trott. \"A consequence of Rule 34 is that somewhere on the net, there's OBO bongo,\" says Ant Pease. \"What do these people do? Go to secret underground parties on the weekends in rudimentary Andy Bull outfits? Whatever happens, I think we can all agree that it's a horrifying thought.\"</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>28th over: England 162-2 (Trott 42, Bell 22)</strong> George Dockrell returns to the attack and hurries through another accurate over at a cost of just three. \"Kebab Harbinger?\" offers Andy Blamey.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>29th over: England 165-2 (Trott 43, Bell 24)</strong> Three singles from Stirling's over. \"I'm Rule 35-ing OBOs right now,\" says Andrew Jobson. \"'<em>Bull and Smyth are alone in a forgotten basement of Guardian Towers. Across the Wotsit-strewn room their eyes meet, and though their hearts race as if they were facing the Windies attacks of the 70s and 80s, they have never been more sure of anything in their lives (except that Dale Steyn is the only great fast bowler currently playing international cricket)</em>.'\" An otherwise credible scenario is let down by one errant detail: the mention of Wotsits rather than Monster Munch.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>30th over: England 176-2 (Trott 45, Bell 32)</strong> The field is up only for Trott, in fact, challenging him to hit over the top. They know that Bell can hit over the top, as he shows with a beautifully timed chip over extra cover for six off Dockrell. Five additional singles make it a very good over for England, who are still on course for 300. \"Brewery-related suggestions requested on the OBO, whose members couldn't organise an etc?\" sys Mac Millings. \"All right, I'll bite. My preferred tipples would include: Protective Bubble; Undeserved Confidence-Giver; Distance Keeper; Slow-Release Humiliation Drink.\"</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>31st over: England 178-2 (Trott 46, Bell 34)</strong> \"How about Delusion Enhancer?\" hics Woody Phillips. That's the only beer they have on tap at the OBO local, the Slug &amp; Manic Depression.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>32nd over: England 189-2 (Trott 52, Bell 39)</strong> Bell, on the charge, drags Dockrell just short of Ed Joyce, running round from deep mid on, and the ball scoots away for four. That's a rare false stroke in this serene third-wicket partnership. Later in the over Trott sweeps firmly for four to bring up yet another half-century, this one from 55 balls.  \"For the designated drivers,\" begins Ant Pease, \"you could sell pints of non-alcoholic Garfield Sober.\" Honk!</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>33rd over: England 198-2 (Trott 57, Bell 43)</strong> Trott squeezes Stirling for four, just the third boundary in his nine overs. England are cruising. \"The reason the bread men haven't jumped on the Johnston, Mooney, and O'Brien thing,\" begins Fergal Downey, \"is probably due to the fact that 'fame' and 'cricket' have never been uttered in the same sentence in Ireland.\"</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>34th over: England 205-2 (Trott 58, Bell 48)</strong> Bell pulls the new bowler Boyd Rankin for four more. England are getting a boundary <em>and</em> a handful of singles in most overs. \"Apart from writing and directing Top Gun 2, my main life goal is to open a pub called the Beer &amp; Cheeseburger,\" says Niall Harden, \"and I'm glad to announce we'd be happy to stock your works.\"</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>35th over: England 211-2 (Trott 60, Bell 52)</strong> Bell reaches a classy half-century with a nice chip over midwicket for two off Stirling. What a beautiful player he is. All those years we spent <del>using every cuss word under the sun</del> worrying about whether he'd crack it were worthwhile. I still reckon he needs to free his mind a touch when batting at No4, and if he does he'll be up there with the best one-day batsmen in the world. \"If someone is looking for OBO bongo I'd have thought the collected works of Millings would cover it,\" says Robin Hazlehurst. \"On the subject of Powerplays, why do sides bowling against England always take the bowling Powerplay so early? Surely they'd do much better to wait until England are really settled and comfortable around 35 or 40 overs and take it then and freak them out. And if you're getting the pints in, mine is a Jaw-screw Loosener with a Dribble Generator chaser, cheers.\"</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>36th over: England 215-2 (Trott 62, Bell 54)</strong> Trent Johnston is back into the attack – he and Rankin are both new-ball bowlers and replacement-ball bowlers – and concedes four singles. Trott now has 999 ODI runs and, as a few of you have pointed out, is about to join <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283174.html\">Viv and KP in the record books</a>. Staggering stuff – especially as he had four consecutive single-figure scores at one stage. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E1nO_RigVE\">I could watch this video of Viv all day</a>. \"I've had a pint or two of Dignity Remover in my time,\" toasts Phil Sawyer. \"A popular tipple in Sawyer Towers.\"</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>37th over: England 224-2 (Trott 66, Bell 59)</strong> Trott works the returning Dockrell through midwicket for two to bring up 1000 ODI runs. Dockrell then tosses one up to Bell, who dances down the wicket and blasts it through extra cover for four. I know it's only Ireland, but these two are playing with lovely authority. \"The Beer that would sell best in the OBO Arms would be called 'Hope',\" says Rob McEvoy. \"People would binge on it during the first 40 overs of an England performance, when it would run out. You can do your own jokes after that point.\"</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>38th over: England 233-2 (Trott 69, Bell 65)</strong> Inventive stuff from Bell, who goes miles outside off stump to lap Johnston over short fine leg for four. That was remarkable, not least because the ball was so far outside off stump as to almost be a wide had Bell left it. That boundary is supplemented by five singles and, as on Sunday, England's dot-ball ratio has been impressively low. \"The older gentleman might enjoy a sit-down with the Sunday papers,\" begins Ant Pease, \"and a relaxing pint of IPA Richards.\"</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>39th over: England 241-2 (Trott 71, Bell 68)</strong> I don't know how to break this to you, but <strong>England have taken the batting Powerplay</strong>. If we view it dispassionately, this is surely the right decision, but we may alter that view when England lose four wickets in the next two overs. The first over, bowled by Dockrell, brings five singles and three wides. \"Uncertainty Provider,\" says Chris Bennett. \"Tagline: '<em>After five pints, every corridor's a Corridor of Uncertainty... Every pavement a Pavement of Uncertainty, your balance will be so far gone that even your armchair becomes an Armchair of Uncertainty</em>'.\" And as for that spiral staircase...</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>40th over: England 257-2 (Trott 80, Bell 70)</strong> Sixteen from the over. Cusack slips some filth down the leg side for five wides, and then Trott picks up consecutive boundaries with a timed push down the ground and a brilliant cover drive. \"Born and raised in England of Irish parents,\" says Adrian Neville. \"Now living in Ireland. I want the English football team to beat Ireland, the Irish rugby team to beat England and the English cricket team to win in a tight one. It's to do with the better team and the better chance of going on to win the whole tournament. However, my increasing wish to see the England rugby team beaten may reveal a growing Irish inculcation. How do others deal with what must be a common enough dichotomy?\"</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>41st over: England 267-2 (Trott 82, Bell 73)</strong> England are hurtling along in this batting Powerplay, with 10 from that over by Dockrell. There were five more wides, speared down the leg side, and the usual helping of singles. Those five wides also brought up the 150 partnership, which has come at more than a run a ball despite these two never really forcing the issue. If Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene had put this partnership together we would be salivating over their unobtrusive class.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>42nd over: England 274-2 (Trott 83, Bell 79)</strong> Bell even makes unorthodoxy look pretty, as with that premeditated sweep for four off Johnston. Nine more from the over, and 41 from four in this Powerplay. \"My brother and I were brought up in London,\" begins Dom O'Reilly. \"Scottish Mum, Canadian Dad whose great-grandparents were Irish. Ireland v Canada rugby international and my Dad is supporting Ireland against the land of his birth while his two sons supported Canada. I cheer Anyone But England in football but support the England cricket team. A lot of my friends and family in Scotland do the same.\" I also support the England cricket team and anyone but the England football team. That's just logical, no?</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 278-3 (Bell c Stirling b Mooney 81)</strong> Ian Bell falls to the last ball of the Powerplay. He chipped a low full toss from Mooney to midwicket, where Stirling took a fine catch diving to his left. That was a gorgeous innings from Bell, 81 from 86 balls.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>43rd over: England 278-3 (Trott 85, Collingwood 0)</strong> England scored 45 from that Powerplay. \"I had a quick look at the list fastest players to 1000 ODI runs and what I can't quite figure out is how Michael Atherton managed this feat in 25 innings,\" says Neil Toolan. \"Athers accomplished this feat faster than the likes of Trescothick and Hayden, remarkable.\" Atherton was a very good and underrated one-day player. Like Trott, he paced an innings very well, and don't forget in those days 250 was a good score so he could aim to bat through for around 120 not out. His century against West Indies in 1995 – when he was 0 from 27 balls (I think) on a greentop and ended up scoring at more than a run a ball – was one of the great ODI centuries by an Englishman.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>44th over: England 288-3 (Trott 92, Collingwood 2)</strong> Trott guides Rankin's first ball to third man and then drives a single to move into the nineties. In this era of explosive, unorthodox batsmanship, his old-school virtues almost make him a maverick. And what an absurd, fascinating and brilliant run-gathering maverick he is. Collingwood takes a tight single to mid on; he would have been out with a direct hit. \"Born and raised in England, with a South African father, I have a similar conundrum to that of the 40th over's Adrian Neville,\" says Mac Millings. \"My resolution is that I want England to beat South Africa. I want Bangladesh to beat South Africa. I want India to beat South Africa. I also want Pakistan, the West Indies, Sri Lanka, Ireland, Kenya, The Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand - hell, even Australia - to beat South Africa. And the best part? Pretty often, South Africa will even beat themselves.\"</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 288-4 (Trott b Mooney 92)</strong> A textbook example of the commentator's curse. Mike Atherton launches into an extended eulogy to Jonathan Trott, who wafts outside a straight one from John Mooney a split-second later. So ends another masterful innings from Trott, 92 at precisely a run a ball.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>45th over: England 294-4 (Collingwood 3, Prior 4)</strong> The new batsman Matt Prior is beaten first ball by a good leg-cutter from Mooney, and then swipes a low full toss over midwicket for four. \"I do wish I had a mixed heritage so I could support Anyone But England in football,\" says Ian Copestake. I don't have a mixed heritage, but I still support Anyone But That Set of Loathsome Chancers. Why wouldn't you? How could you possibly take any pride in anything that lot achieve? Not even patriotism is that powerful, or least it shouldn't be.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 299-5 (Prior b Johnston 6)</strong> Prior makes room and misses; Johnston hits.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>46th over: England 299-5 (Collingwood 5, Bresnan 0)</strong> Tim Bresnan has been promoted above Michael Yardy. \"It's a tricky one,\" says Jane. \"Born in England of Welsh parents, now living in Ireland with an Irish partner. Generally it's Wales first, Ireland second and anyone but England third. Apart from cricket, when it's England first and anyone but Australia (and South Africa) second. It does mean there's almost always someone to support...\"</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 312-6 (Collingwood c K O'Brien b Mooney 16)</strong> That's a <em>monstrous</em> six from Collingwood, slugged over long on and onto the roof. But he falls trying to repeat the stroke, holing out to Kevin O'Brien at long on.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>47th over: England 312-6 (Bresnan 1, Yardy 0)</strong> That was a decent, selfless knock from Collingwood, 16 from 11 balls. \"I have an Irish grandmother, a Scottish grandmother and two English grandfathers,\" begins Gordon Cain. \"I once went to New Zealand to work and to Spain for my holidays. I also watch the Simpsons on TV, So I support New Zealand at rugby, Spain at football, the United States at baseball and England at bog-snorkling. Safe bet eh?\"</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>48th over: England 315-6 (Bresnan 2, Yardy 2)</strong> Bumble has gone off on one about that Ian Bell decision the other night. \"It's not out, get over it. Enough time spent messing around with endorsements and adverts, read the laws of the game!\" Brilliant stuff. And very good stuff from Rankin, who concedes just three from that over. \"I don't support any of the following: the country where I was born, the country my parents are from, the country my passport claims I belong to,\" says Kat Petersen. \"Which leaves me with England for cricket and rugby (with a soft spot for Bangladesh and Wales respectively) and Uruguay for football. Nationalism is over-rated, pick'n'mix is a much better system.\"</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 317-7 (Yardy b Johnston 3)</strong> Johnston cleans Yardy up with a fine slower ball that grips off the pitch, and becomes the first Irishman to take 50 ODI wickets. Well played sir.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>49th over: England 318-7 (Bresnan 3, Swann 1)</strong> That was an excellent penultimate over from Johnston, costing just three runs. \"I was brought up in England to Irish parents with a Jamaican uncle (by marriage) who taught me cricket,\" says Stephen Greene. \"I am married to a Brazilian and living in Brazil.  I support England for everything just because it makes my brain hurt to think about it all.\"</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>50th over: England 327-8 (Swann not out 9, Bresnan c Johnston b Mooney 4)</strong> The last over of the innings, from John Mooney, goes for nine, including a chirpy slap down the ground for four from Swann and the wicket of Bresnan, who holes out off the last delivery of the innings. So <strong>Ireland need an unlikely 328 to win</strong>. Alan Gardner will be with you for the first 10 overs of their innings, then it's me again I'm afraid.</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>Positivity dept, with Kyle McCallan:</strong> \"We've restricted England to less than India managed.\" That's the Irish perspective from McCallan on the Sky sofa. It hardly needs me to play the Grinch and point out that even if England don't keep Ireland below the 178 they scored against Bangladesh, this could still be a bloodbath. However, thanks to England's Associate Nation Benevolent Programme, it will probably be a more closely run thing than that.</p><p>Anyway, the Ireland innings is due to start at about 1.15pm. Do stick around to find out how much of a struggle England make of things.</p><!-- Block 62 --><p><strong>WICKET! Porterfield b Anderson (1st over: Ireland 0-1, target 328)</strong> William Porterfield takes guard, eyes Jimmy Anderson coming in for his first delivery, takes a huge swing at a full, wide delivery ... and chopes on to his own stumps. If any England bowler needed a gimme wicket like that, then it's Anderson, whose 2011 World Cup figures before that delivery were 19.5-0-163-1. Not that 20-0-163-2 is <em>that</em> much better.</p><!-- Block 63 --><p><strong>1st over: Ireland 2-1 (target 328, Stirling 0, Joyce 1)</strong> So Ed Joyce comes in to face his old country with his old-old country. Smyth informs me that this is the first time this has ever happened in one-day internationals (ie. a player has faced both countries he has represented). Anderson gets a couple of deliveries to shape nicely away from the batsmen as well as throwing in a wide. Typical Jimmy. Here's Stewart Boyle: \"I was brought up in England the son of two Scots. Not only has this given me an air of arrogant smug superiority balanced by a simmering underlying self-loathing fuelled by my massive chip on my shoulder, but it has also driven me to an existential crisis- basically I'll support anyone but the teams I like.\"</p><!-- Block 64 --><p><strong>2nd over: Ireland 10-1 (target 328, Stirling 6, Joyce 2)</strong> Stuart Broad, back in the side after his bout of Bully Belly, <strong>calls for a review </strong>off of his third delivery to Joyce. It hit the left-hander in line but pitched well outside leg-stump so Billy Bowden's decision to decline the appeal <strong>is rightly upheld</strong>. Paul Stirling then swivel pulls to the boundary for four to make Irish eyes smile, or something.</p><!-- Block 65 --><p><strong>3rd over: Ireland 10-1 (target 328, Stirling 6, Joyce 2)</strong> Anderson seems to have packed his mojo today. Or his radar, at least. His line and length are much better. And before you say it's Ireland and not India he's bowling to, his figures against Netherlands were equally bad. Anyway, that's a welcome maiden, Anderson's first of the competition. \"My mother-in-law is Welsh, which makes my children a quarter Welsh – every four days I have to give them a quick clip round the ear to remind them.\" David Bavin can't let go of the urge to subjugate.</p><!-- Block 66 --><p><strong>4th over: Ireland 20-1 (target 328, Stirling 15, Joyce 3)</strong> To those of you querying the Joyce stat, firstly: Morgan has yet to play for England against Ireland; and Kepler Wessels didn't play for Australia against South Africa. Joyce has played for England against Ireland <em>and</em> for Ireland against England: the full set. Stirling heaves at Broad's first ball, getting a thick edge to the boundary – and then he punches another four through the legside from the last delivery of the over, from which 10 runs came.</p><!-- Block 67 --><p><strong>5th over: Ireland 26-1 (target 328, Stirling 15, Joyce 7)</strong> Joyce drives at Anderson and gets four as his reward despite pushing the ball aerially through the cover region and not far from Strauss's dive. Anderson then comes back by ripping an unplayable delivery straight through Joyce. \"England . . . struggling. I am sure you only said that in order that you could invoke reverse psychology to the OBO world.\" If only it were that simple, Ian Palmer, I would write things like \"you're not going to enjoy this at all\" and \"this will be the worst OBO you've ever read\". Which would be dangerously literal.</p><!-- Block 68 --><p><strong>6th over: Ireland 32-1 (target 328, Stirling 20, Joyce 8)</strong> Paul Stirling seems to have taken to Broad. After exchanging singles with Joyce, the young opener picked Broad's slower ball and launched it like a rocket towards the long-on boundary. It didn't quite go all the way but it wasn't far shy. He's very confident, is Stirling, and he looks to have a solid technique to back it up.</p><!-- Block 69 --><p><strong>7th over: Ireland 42-1 (target 328, Stirling 20, Joyce 13)</strong> England are going to have to work for wickets on this track, make no mistake. Porterfield basically committed suicide, which neither Stirling or Joyce looks like doing. The latter runs one off the face down to third man for four before another ball flicks off of Stirling's hip, past Prior's goalie-like attempt to save it and down to the rope. The run rate is six and over and that's just fine for Ireland at this stage.</p><!-- Block 70 --><p><strong>8th over: Ireland 44-1 (target 328, Stirling 21, Joyce 14)</strong> Tim Bresnan replaces Broad and is immediately on the money, cramping the batsmen for room and bowling with good aggression. What an awesome winter this has been for Bres – from Swann's fat Twitter buddy to key cog in the England attack. Just two runs from the over. \"Can I be the first to say that I think Ireland are going to chase this total down?\" asks Josh Robinson. \"Or has someone else said it already?\" I think everyone has muttered it to themselves under their breath. But, in all seriousness, they're not.</p><!-- Block 71 --><p><strong>9th over: Ireland 53-1 (target 328, Stirling 28, Joyce 16)</strong> It's not quite opening the bowling with Johan Botha – or even Ray Price, to be honest – but Strauss has brought on Yardy for <del>some filth</del> a twirl. It's like a night out at the Walkabout: easy singles all round. That is until a four off the final ball of the over from Stirling ruins my metaphor. \"Eric Midwinter played Tests for and against England and Australia,\" notes Alan Tuffery. Ah, yes, well I should have made clear that I meant in ODIs ... my bad.</p><!-- Block 72 --><p><strong>WICKET! Stirling 32 c Pietersen b Bresnan (10th over: Ireland 62-2)</strong> Just as Stirling was beginning to tuck in, he got hurried into a pull by Bresnan and spliced high into the Bengaluru night sky. Kevin Pietersen takes a good catch, falling backwards to cushion his landing as the ball plummets from out of darkness.</p><!-- Block 73 --><p><strong>10th over: Ireland 62-2 (target 328, Joyce 21, O'Brien 0)</strong> Joyce and Stirling had both already hit fours, so that still wasn't a bad over for Ireland, but Bresnan has pulled it back a bit with that wicket. More on the vexed question of national affiliation from Will Parson: \"My wife is Welsh and I am English and we are already competing for our three-year-old's future sporting allegiance. Yesterday (St David's Day) he was given a Welsh Dragon hat with wings and tail, of the sort worn by the unselfconscious at rugby games. What dignity-stripping, stereotype-enforcing, gimmicky English gift should I counter with? A young man's future happiness/chronic misery depends on it!\" Come on, people, this man needs your help.</p><!-- Block 74 --><p><strong>11th over: Ireland 63-2 (target 328, Joyce 21, O'Brien 1)</strong> Strauss had enough of Yardy after just the six balls (and who can blame him), so chucks it to Swann instead. And he's rewarded with five delightful dot balls. That's yer lot from me, Smyth's returning to take the hot seat once more ...</p><!-- Block 75 --><p><strong>12th over: Ireland 64-2 (target 328, Joyce 21, O'Brien 2)</strong> Hello. You're just in time to read about Matt Prior dropping an awkward steepling chance when Joyce top-edges a pull. Prior probably should have taken that. Joyce almost went the previous ball as well, clunking a pull just short of Anderson at mid on.</p><!-- Block 76 --><p><strong>13th over: Ireland 66-2 (target 328, Joyce 22, O'Brien 3)</strong> Joyce is living a charmed life at the moment, and inside edges Swann just wide of leg stump.<br />\"Suggestion for Will Parson,\" says Iain Gray. \"A beer gut and third-degree sunburn.\" I have no idea to what this refers.</p><!-- Block 77 --><p><strong>14th over: Ireland 68-2 (target 328, Joyce 23, O'Brien 4)</strong> Bresnan's heavy ball is giving Ireland problems, and another one booms past O'Brien's attempted pull.<br />The required rate is rising towards 7.50. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9xnMvgO0A#t=0m08s\">here's the funniest LBW you'll see today</a>, and most other days. \"I am Dutch living in London with an English boyfriend; this means that football (Netherlands) and rugby (England) are easy, but cricket is a bit of a worry...\" says Eva Broer. \"Under normal circumstances (i.e. Ashes and such) I support England, but last week I found myself for the first time in a while not cheering for Jimmy and we (the mighty Dutch) nearly won, which was thrilling. After the group stage, however, mefears it will be back to cheering for England, though....\"</p><!-- Block 78 --><p><strong>15th over: Ireland 76-2 (target 328, Joyce 24, O'Brien 11)</strong> Another dropped chance. O'Brien drove Swann inside out to long off, where Anderson mistimed his leap and felt the ball go through his hands for six. For a fielder of Anderson's considerable class that was pretty straightforward. That's the third consecutive game in which Swann and Anderson have had a bromance-denting moment. What's going on with England's fielding in this tournament? \"You think you have problems,\" says Peter Mackelworth, who is talking to you lot, not me. \"My wife is half-Croat and half-Bosnian Serb; I am English with Scottish/Irish roots. My poor son chips on both shoulders and may even his hips...\"</p><!-- Block 79 --><p><strong>16th over: Ireland 86-2 (target 328, Joyce 25, O'Brien 19)</strong> A short ball from Bresnan is pulled emphatically over midwicket for four by the combative O'Brien. Fine shot. O'Brien pulls four more round the corner from a poor delivery two balls later. \"I'm an Irishman living in England these past 13 years, and in that time have developed soft spot for the English Ccicket team,\" says Niall Larkin. \"However, I think this notion about support is more to do with fans and participants in said sport than it is about the actual sport itself. For example, I could never, ever support England in football or r-ugby, principally because of the maddening arrogance of the first and the er, maddening arrogance of the second. But cricket? With its Irish-style sense of gloom and depression, mixed with Hope Enhancer and dewy eyed sentiment? Now there's a sport I can get on board with.'</p><!-- Block 80 --><p><strong>17th over: Ireland 90-2 (target 328, Joyce 27, O'Brien 21)</strong> Four singles from Swann's over. \"I have grandparents from Italy, Ireland and Scotland,\" says Robert McBridge. \"I'm English.  There's a rumour my Unlce was born in Wales so if I can persuade a French girl – literally any French girl – to marry me, I'll have the Six Nations sewn up.  We'd then have to start some sort of cult to cover the cricket World Cup.\"</p><!-- Block 81 --><p><strong>18th over: Ireland 92-2 (target 328, Joyce 28, O'Brien 22)</strong> Paul Collingwood is on to bowl some cutters after that good spell from Bresnan (5-0-25-1). O'Brien toe-ends a lap stroke right into his grille in an over that brings two singles. This is over as a contest, but Ireland's response has been pretty decent. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9xnMvgO0A#t=0m08s\">The reaction of Gatt to that somewhat hasty finger</a> has given me an idea for a new ballet in which a dying swan is informed that, alas, the last steak and kidney pie has just been sold,\" says Rob Jacques. \"Sadler's Wells here I come.\"</p><!-- Block 82 --><p><strong>19th over: Ireland 96-2 (target 328, Joyce 29, O'Brien 24)</strong> O'Brien comes down the track to Swann and smacks a single to long off. He's played with impressive purpose and has 24 from 30 balls.</p><!-- Block 83 --><p><strong>20th over: Ireland 102-2 (target 328, Joyce 30, O'Brien 29)</strong> Collingwood has a speculative appeal against O'Brien turned down. I'm not even sure what it was for. Does anyone have anything to talk about? We've got 30 more overs of this. Riffs please!</p><!-- Block 84 --><p><strong>WICKET! Ireland 103-3 (N O'Brien b Swann 29)</strong> Niall O'Brien's zesty cameo comes to an end when he hoicks across the line at a quicker, fuller delivery from Swann. It was a dodgy shot but a nice piece of bowling.</p><!-- Block 85 --><p><strong>21st over: Ireland 103-3 (target 328, Joyce 31, Wilson 0)</strong> The new batsman is Gary Wilson. Does anyone remember that photo of him in the Wisden Cricketer after last year's World Twenty20? It's fantastic, the perfect example of a roguish grin.<br />\"I'm currently deputising as a line manager, and my colleague who sits next to me has been on the internet all day, and also complained I was giving him too much work,\" says Alex Warwick. \"As a deputy I don't want to get too involved with warnings and such; however, if there's work to be dished out he needs to accept it. What should I do? Of course I'm online too because I'm writing this, but that's the perk of being the boss.\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZXfBmwALBE\">I love office politics</a>.</p><!-- Block 86 --><p><strong>22nd over: Ireland 105-3 (target 328, Joyce 33, Wilson 1)</strong> That was almost another wicket for England. Wilson chipped the ball back towards Collingwood, who dived to his right but couldn't get there in time. The ball then bounced off the non-striker Joyce, whose presence might have put Collingwood off just a touch.</p><!-- Block 87 --><p><strong>WICKET! Ireland 106-4 (Joyce st Prior b Swann 32)</strong> This is a jaffa from Graeme Swann. Joyce walks down the track and tries to play defensively, but he's beaten by a beauty that drifts in and then turns past the outside edge. Matt Prior does the rest and Joyce just keeps on walking.</p><!-- Block 88 --><p><strong>23rd over: Ireland 110-4 (target 328, Wilson 2, K O'Brien 4)</strong> Kevin O'Brien edges Swann through the vacant slip area for four. \"Is it just me or have the Boring Middle Overs arrived earlier than usual today?\" says Clare Davies. \"Also seems that England are not exactly zipping through their overs. In fact they seem to be going very slowly – even after they were fined for this very offence just a few days ago. I'm a bit bored.\"</p><!-- Block 89 --><p><strong>24th over: Ireland 111-4 (target 328, Wilson 3, K O'Brien 4)</strong> Yardy is on for Collingwood (3-0-10-0) and bowls his second over in approximately 47.21285 seconds. \"How about ideal format for a cricket World Cup?\" says Luke Dealtry. \"I was thinking about the 1992 version, but the first stage results <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Cricket_World_Cup\">weren't much more exciting</a>. Is there any way to make this turkey dance?\" This format but going straight to the semi-finals would be a big improvement, although still far from perfect.</p><!-- Block 90 --><p><strong>WICKET! Ireland 111-5 (Wilson LBW b Swann 3)</strong> Graeme Swann was far too good for Gary Wilson there. He set him up with the slider and then trapped him LBW next ball with a faster, straighter delivery. Wilson missed a sweep and was plumb. He decided to review – not sure why – but replays supported the naked eye. Swann is bowling a gem of a spell and has three for 24.</p><!-- Block 91 --><p><strong>25th over: Ireland 113-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 4, Cusack 2)</strong> \"I just met a very nice Indian chap who asked me to say hello to you,\" says Bull. \"He claimed to be a fan of yours. I told him not to be so bloody stupid.\" Can you say hello to the <em>smartest, most discerning person in the entire known universe</em> on my behalf, please?</p><!-- Block 92 --><p><strong>26th over: Ireland 123-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 13, Cusack 3)</strong> O'Brien pulls some garbage from Yardy over midwicket for four and then slaps another boundary over extra cover. He looks a pretty uncomplicated biffer, the sort of lad who could do a yard of ale in about seven seconds without wincing. \"Dear Points of View,\" begins Ant Pease. \"I'm not terribly interested in food, but really enjoy long, lingering closeups of people crying about meringues. Please could you do something about Masterchef for me?\" Oh crikey, that's on again tonight. Mind you Mission Critical: Hubble is on Discovery.</p><!-- Block 93 --><p><strong>27th over: Ireland 138-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 25, Cusack 6)</strong> Fantastic stuff from Kevin O'Brien, who slog sweeps Swann for two sixes in three balls, both to the same area at deep midwicket. Great stuff. He has raced to 25 from only 14 balls. \"No-one gives a flying one about slow over-rates, do they?\" says Kristian Petterson. \"And I struggle to appreciate the pick n mix approach to supporting teams.  How do you generate enthusiasm?  How do you actually care? If there's nothing to lose, there's nothing to gain.<br />You can keep that aphorism for free – make a badge or a bumper sticker.  No, you're welcome.\"</p><!-- Block 94 --><p><strong>28th over: Ireland 149-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 29, Cusack 7)</strong> Stuart Broad comes on for Michael Yardy (3-0-19-0) and spears some nonsense down the leg side for five wides. The next ball goes to the boundary as well, timed beautifully through point by the impressive O'Brien. \"The problem is the scheduling as much as the format,\" says Simon Ewing. \"You <em>have </em>to have 2 games a day in the group stage. There just isn't the demand or time to give people the chance to watch every delivery. Four groups of four, top two go through to QFs, 2 big guns in each group play each other in the first or second game so it isn't a dead rubber. Mirror the European Championships basically and you're home and hosed in 3 weeks. Obvious right?\" Agree with the scheduling but not the format: far too many dead games in that set up. Cricket has a unique problem – having eight decenet teams, pretty much – so the only way round that is to either go to a Super Six stage (tried and failed) or jump from the groups to the semi-finals. That way all the games in the first stage really matter. At the moment you get far too many chances.</p><!-- Block 95 --><p><strong>29th over: Ireland 156-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 34, Cusack 8)</strong> O'Brien flicks Swann wide of short fine leg for four more. He has 34 from 21 balls, and Swann ends with 10-0-47-3. Well bowled. \"Bit late,\" says Alex Book, \"but if you want some more of that roguish grin, I remember being impressed by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMnq-1gqvJg\">Gary Wilson's 'Hidden Talent'</a> - knowing the shirt number and player of every county team last season.\"</p><!-- Block 96 --><p><strong>30th over: Ireland 166-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 35, Cusack 17)</strong> Cusack edges a cut stroke at Broad through the vacant slip area for four, and that brings up the fifty partnership from just 31 balls. The next ball is thrashed through extra cover for four more by Cusack, a cracking stroke. Broad's figures are a grim 5-0-44-0. \"You could talk about <a href=\"http://www.cyclingtoafrica.com/blog.php\">my sister's ridiculous cycling trip from here to South Africa</a> raising money for Unicef,\" says Jon Conradi, \"and whether she's most likely to be eaten by lions, bitten by scorpions or stoned to death...\"</p><!-- Block 97 --><p><strong>31st over: Ireland 167-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 35, Cusack 18)</strong> The returning Jimmy Anderson has a big shout for LBW against Alex Cusack, but it was probably sliding down leg and they decide not to review. \"Have people started complaining about empty stadia yet?\" says Piers Barclay. \"I'm sure we all got quite vexed about this last time, and apart from the India/Bangladesh games, attendances have been pretty poor so far. Maybe they could ship a load of OBOers are there to fill the seats?\"</p><!-- Block 98 --><p><strong>32nd over: Ireland 183-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 43, Cusack 19)</strong> Michael Yardy returns to the attack, just as Ireland take their batting Powerplay. A shocking over goes for 16, including four byes, two wides and consecutive pulls for four by O'Brien, who now has 43 from 27 balls. What a storming innings he is playing. \"Why not start the tournament with a knock-out round,\" says Chris Keylock. \"The top 8 are seeded against the unseeded 9th to 16th sides; this keeps the smaller nations in but reduces the number of one-sided games. The remaining 8 then play in two pools of 4 structured based on the seedings in the earlier round, e.g. teams seeded 1, 4, 5, 8 and 2, 3, 6, 7 assumin they all make it through. There is then a cross-over semi-final (2nd in pool 1 vs winner of pool 2) leading to a final and 3rd/4th place play off.\" That's a pretty good suggestion. I suppose the only significant problem is that at least one Test-playing nation would only get one game.</p><!-- Block 99 --><p><strong>33rd over: Ireland 192-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 51, Cusack 21)</strong> O'Brien brings up a sensational half-century in style, pulling Anderson behind square for six. He has faced just 31 balls, and this is the fastest-ever ODI fifty by an Irishman. Wonderful stuff. \"Instead of having fewer Associate teams in there, why not have a couple more?\" says Steve Betteley. \"Make it 16 teams based on rankings (the current teams with Afghanistan and Scotland added which surely wouldn't dilute the quality). Four groups of four, top two go through to knockouts. Seed it on rankings. You'll still get the best teams in the quarter finals, plus each associate team gets experience against the better teams and one match against another Associate team. It would make more sense as a tournament I think. 16 is just a good number for tournament play.\" I agree about 16 being a good number – and the football World Cup should still be a 16-team affair – but surely that suggested format has far too many dead games in the group stages. Apart from Bangladesh's group, every match would be dead, pretty much.</p><!-- Block 100 --><p><strong>34th over: Ireland 205-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 62, Cusack 22)</strong> O'Brien merry innings continues with an attempted hook off the returning Bresnan that flies to third man for four. And then he plays the most astonishing shot, making room to blitz the ball over the covers for six. Stunning stuff. <em>That's</em> how you use a Powerplay. Panicking yet? Ireland need 123 from 96 balls. \"Can't we have a four-team zonal group stage like the old B&amp;H Cup?\" says Ian Burch. \"England's group could feature Holland, Scotland &amp; Ireland. The teams from the subcontinent would no doubt be the group of death while Canada, Windies, NZ and Australia would fit nicely together.  There are only three teams from Africa so a Derrick Robbins IX could make up the numbers there.\"</p><!-- Block 101 --><p><strong>35th over: Ireland 222-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 76, Cusack 26)</strong> Sensational cricket from Kevin O'Brien, who has just smeared Jimmy Anderson for 17! An inside edge to fine leg for four brings up a glorious hundred partnership from only 61 balls – <em>sixty-one balls! </em> – and O'Brien celebrates with a beautiful pinged cover drive, holding the pose as it races away for four. He saves the best for last, driving a monstrous six over midwicket – the first 100-metre six of the tournament. \"Kapow!\" screams Mark Nicholas in the commentary box. O'Brien has 76 from just 38 balls. \"We've got the moral victory in the bag,\" says Evan Fanning.</p><!-- Block 102 --><p><strong>36th over: Ireland 229-5 (target 328, K O'Brien 80, Cusack 28)</strong> O'Brien belts the last ball of the Powerplay, bowled by Yardy, through extra cover for four. This has been a staggering assault: 62 from five overs, and O'Brien has 80 from 38 balls. 80 from 38 balls. If Ireland win this game, he is never going to buy another drink in his life. If Ireland lose this game, he is never going to buy another drink in his life. This has been one of the most audacious innings in the history of the World Cup. 80 from 38 balls!</p><!-- Block 103 --><p><strong>37th over: Ireland 243-5 (need 85 from 78 balls; K O'Brien 90, Cusack 29)</strong> Andy Stroud and Luke Dealtry both cite the same A-word: Astle. And yu can see why, because O'Brien is destroying England! After a quiet start to the over he pulls consecutive deliveries from Bresnan for four and then six, the second a monster that went miles in the air and flew into the crowd. This is an astonishing innings, up there with John Davison's in 2003. He has 90 from 42 balls! \"All this chat about format is well and good,\" says Graham Samuel-Gibbon, \"but am I the only one getting a bit nervous about Ireland chuntering away at almost 11 an over from the last 10 overs?\"</p><!-- Block 104 --><p><strong>38th over: Ireland 248-5 (need 80 from 72 balls; K O'Brien 93, Cusack 31)</strong> Andrew Strauss has dropped Kevin O'Brien! Collingwood was the bowler, and O'Brien swiped one miles in the air. Strauss charged round from mid off I think, but the ball slipped out of his grasp. That was a really difficult chance because it went so high in the air and he was running at full pelt. \"Being a second generation plastic Paddy can be confusing at times,\" says Lee Cashin. \"Personally, I'd like to see an Ireland v England hurling match.\" Especially if John Terry plays.</p><!-- Block 105 --><p><strong>39th over: Ireland 252-5 (need 76 from 66 balls; K O'Brien 93, Cusack 32)</strong> Cusack drives Yardy on the bounce to long off and is then dropped by Yardy, a sharp but catchable return chance. England fielding has gone to seed. \"I feel sick,\" says Guy Hornsby. \"I'm having a shocker at work today, and I was looking forward to us getting a massive total and then skittling the Irish out for about 180. This however, is making it even worse. The last thing I need is to have the Irish, or, more accurately, Kevin O'Brien single-handedly, beat us into submission. It's an astonishing innings, but as I'd said way back in those heady days of England's early overs, this is doing nothing for my blood pressure.\"</p><!-- Block 106 --><p><strong>40th over: Ireland 263-5 (need 65 from 60 balls; K O'Brien 97, Cusack 40)</strong> This is astonishing stuff. Cusack joins in the fun, slog-sweeping Collingwood  for six! Then O'Brien blasts the last ball down the ground for four to bring up the 150 partnership from only 94 balls. These two are giving it one hell of lash. Ireland, who were 399-1 with the bookies earlier on, are arguably favourites now. \"You know when is a bad time to give up smoking?\" says Kat Petersen. \"At the beginning of this World Cup. Never has my resolve been so tested as during the England games. I'm going to bill the ECB for extra nicotine gum.\"</p><!-- Block 107 --><p><strong>41st over: Ireland 272-5 (need 56 from 54 balls; K O'Brien 100, Cusack 46)</strong> Kevin O'Brien reaches one of the most amazing centuries in the history of cricket. He has <em>smashed</em> the record for the fastest World Cup hundred. It stood at 66 balls; he needed only 50! <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/211608.html\">It's also the sixth fastest in ODIs</a>. He has gone off on a mini lap of honour, and quite right too. I have never seen anything like this. He has hit 13 fours and six sixes, most of them through some of the cleanest striking imaginable.</p><!-- Block 108 --><p><strong>WICKET! Ireland 273-6 (Cusack run out 47)</strong> England get the wicket they desperately needed. There was a mix-up between O'Brien and Cusack, who sacrificed himself for the cause. The ball was thrown by Collingwood at point to the bowler Broad, whose underarm shy hit the stumps with Cusack just short. His innings was understandably lost amid O'Brien's onslaught, but he played really well to make 47 from 58 balls. The partnership was 162 in a mere 17.1 overs.</p><!-- Block 109 --><p><strong>42nd over: Ireland 275-6 (need 53 from 48 balls; K O'Brien 101, Mooney 1)</strong> Ireland need 53 from eight overs. I wonder what Ray Houghton is doing right now. \"I am always an England fan,\" says Emiel de Bont, \"but as a member of the Minnows League, I say, 'Go Ireland, go!'.\" Too right. Ireland <em>have</em> to win this now.</p><!-- Block 110 --><p><strong>43rd over: Ireland 279-6 (need 49 from 42 balls; K O'Brien 102, Mooney 3)</strong> O'Brien is almost run out by Bell, running in from the covers to throw just wide of the stumps. Four from Bresnan's over. This is too close to call. But maybe Ireland are just losing their way a touch, with just seven from the last two overs. \"The ICC should be hanging their heads in shame,\" says Charlie Talbot. \"How can they possibly keep the associates out of the next World Cup?\" Correct. As Bull and Selvey have already noted on these pages, so much of the World Cup's charm comes from the Associates. We'll be talking about this innings for decades.</p><!-- Block 111 --><p><strong>44th over: Ireland 288-6 (need 40 from 36 balls; K O'Brien 106, Mooney 8)</strong> O'Brien is starting to tire. He pulls Broad through midwicket and labours a bit on his way back for two. There are a few singles, and then Mooney edges the last ball to third man for four to make it Ireland's over. They need 40 from 36 balls to spark the biggest booze-up in the history of mankind. \"The one thing that England rarely do in the field is effect a run-out from a direct throw, no matter how much they practise,\" says John Starbuck. \"Who should be appointed as the Run-out coach? Jocky Wilson?\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2004/mar/05/smalltalk.sportinterviews\">Bobby George</a>?</p><!-- Block 112 --><p><strong>45th over: Ireland 293-6 (need 35 from 30 balls; K O'Brien 106, Mooney 12)</strong> Bresnan rams in a superb bouncer that hits Mooney right in the grille, and Prior dives to his left to take a superb catch (and save four byes). England appealed for caught behind but it was off the helmet only. Just one from the first five balls but then Mooney again edges to third man for four! \"I'm on a train going through Fife and I fear I am about to lose my signal and miss the humiliating final overs,\" says David Avery. \"The anticipation of defeat/ not knowing is going to be hell.\"</p><!-- Block 113 --><p><strong>46th over: Ireland 301-6 (need 27 from 24 balls; K O'Brien 108, Mooney 18)</strong> Mooney plays a stunning stroke, blasting Broad through extra cover for four to bring up the 300! This is unreal. Eight from Broad's over, and Ireland need 27 from the last four overs. They have to win from here, surely. To compound England's misery, Broad is limping heavily. It looks like a problem with his left knee.</p><!-- Block 114 --><p><strong>46.1 overs: Ireland 301-6 (need 27 from 23 balls; K O'Brien 108, Mooney 18)</strong> Here's Tim Bresnan to bowl his last over, and starts with a good one that beats Mooney outside off stump.</p><!-- Block 115 --><p><strong>46.2 overs: Ireland 301-6 (need 27 from 22 balls; K O'Brien 108, Mooney 18)</strong> Another dot ball, pushed to point. O'Brien is being starved of the strike; I think he has faced just eight of the last 29 balls.</p><!-- Block 116 --><p><strong>46.3 overs: Ireland 305-6 (need 23 from 21 balls; K O'Brien 108, Mooney 22)</strong> What a shot from Mooney! He makes room and flashes a cut over the covers for four. Sensational stuff!</p><!-- Block 117 --><p><strong>46.4 overs: Ireland 305-6 (need 23 from 20 balls; K O'Brien 108, Mooney 22)</strong> A good bouncer from Bresnan goes through to Prior.</p><!-- Block 118 --><p><strong>46.5 overs: Ireland 306-6 (need 22 from 19 balls; K O'Brien 108, Mooney 23)</strong> Mooney pulls into the leg side for just a single.</p><!-- Block 119 --><p><strong>47 overs: Ireland 308-6 (need 20 from 18 balls; K O'Brien 110, Mooney 23)</strong> A wonderful yorker from Bresnan is jammed into the ground by O'Brien who sets off for a single. Bresnan tries to run Mooney out with a sidefoot - but kicks it for another run! Mooney will keep the strike. O'Brien has faced just four deliveries in the last three overs, yet Ireland are still on course for an astonishing win.</p><!-- Block 120 --><p><strong>47.1 overs: Ireland 309-6 (need 19 from 17 balls; K O'Brien 110, Mooney 24)</strong> Jimmy Anderson is coming back into the attack and is worked for a single by Mooney. Broad is hobbling but England may need him to bowl the last over. If it's not him it'll have to be Collingwood or Yardy.</p><!-- Block 121 --><p><strong>47.2 overs: Ireland 310-6 (need 18 from 16 balls; K O'Brien 111, Mooney 24)</strong> O'Brien drives Anderson calmly to long off for another single.</p><!-- Block 122 --><p><strong>47.3 overs: Ireland 310-6 (need 18 from 15 balls; K O'Brien 111, Mooney 24)</strong> A dot ball from Anderson, cramping Mooney for room.</p><!-- Block 123 --><p><strong>47.4 overs: Ireland 311-6 (need 17 from 14 balls; K O'Brien 111, Mooney 24)</strong> A lucky escape for Mooney, who is deceived by a slower ball and loops it safely towards mid on for one.</p><!-- Block 124 --><p><strong>47.5 overs: Ireland 312-6 (need 16 from 13 balls; K O'Brien 112, Mooney 24)</strong> Another single, driven to midwicket by O'Brien. He has been almost serene the last few overs.</p><!-- Block 125 --><p><strong>48 overs: Ireland 316-6 (need 12 from 12 balls; K O'Brien 112, Mooney 28)</strong> Brilliant shot from Mooney, who pulls Anderson through midwicket for four more! This is <em>staggering</em> cricket from Ireland, who are on the brink of one of the all-time great victories. If they win it will be the highest run chase in World Cup history.</p><!-- Block 126 --><p><strong>48.1 overs: WICKET! Ireland 317-7 (O'Brien run out 113)</strong> Another twist in this amazing game. O'Brien digs out a yorker from Broad towards backward square leg and heads wearily back for a second. Prior takes Bresnan's throw in front of the stumps and demolishes the stumps with O'Brien a fraction short. He walks off to a huge ovation after an unbelievable performance, 113 from 63 balls.</p><!-- Block 127 --><p><strong>48.2 overs: Ireland 321-6 (need 7 from 10 balls; Mooney 28, Johnston 4)</strong> Trent Johnston finished things off for Ireland went they beat Pakistan four years ago, and he's the new batsman here. The first ball is a low full toss that Johnston drives for four! What a shot! \"This could possibly be the best day at work ever!\" says Declan Keane. \"Can't wait for highlights later. COME ON KJ!\"</p><!-- Block 128 --><p><strong>48.3 overs: Ireland 321-7 (need 7 from 9 balls; Mooney 28, Johnston 4)</strong> A dot ball from Broad, slipping through to Prior.</p><!-- Block 129 --><p><strong>48.4 overs: Ireland 323-7 (need 5 from 8 balls; Mooney 28, Johnston 6)</strong> Johnston lobs two more towards long on! I can't feel my fingers any more.</p><!-- Block 130 --><p><strong>48.5 overs: Ireland 324-7 (need 4 from 7 balls; Mooney 28, Johnston 7)</strong>  Another run to fine leg! Ireland are so nearly home.</p><!-- Block 131 --><p><strong>49 overs: Ireland 325-7 (need 3 from 6 balls; Mooney 29, Johnston 7)</strong> Mooney calmly pings another single to deep point. Just three needed from the last over. What on earth is happening?</p><!-- Block 132 --><p><strong>IRELAND WIN BY THREE WICKETS WITH FIVE BALLS TO SPARE! 49.1 overs: Ireland 329-7 (Mooney 33, Johnston 4)</strong> Ireland have done it! Mooney hits the winning boundary off Anderson with five balls to spare. This is utterly astonishing, one of the most amazing victories in any sport for years. People are just charging round the Ireland dressing room in a circle, with no idea what to do. Some of the players hare onto the field, with the cameras picking up some big boys' language. I'm not sure even those words can do this justice. Ireland were completely out of it at the halfway stage, but then Alex Cusack and particularly Kevin O'Brien decided to give it a lash, with astonishing consequences. </p><p>O'Brien demolished the record for the fastest World Cup hundred, smashing his off only 50 balls; and then, at the finish, Ireland were ice cool. They played with stunning maturity when the pressure was on. Ireland have also set a new record for the highest World Cup chase. More importantly, they've beaten England. <em>At cricket.</em> Which is about as improbable as beating them at repressed self-loathing. </p><p>England had a shocker, but this is not about them. It's about one of the most charming and joyous wins we'll ever see and a match we will never forget, at least not until we're in the special home and the faculties have gone.

That's just one of the findings in a new UN report on the state of education, out today.</p><p>Published by the <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/\">United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation</a> (Unesco), the report pulls together the most recent data on schooling and education around the world, and – for the first time – also analyses the data through the lens of conflict.</p><blockquote><p>\"When wars break out, international attention and media reporting invariably focus on the most immediate images of human suffering. Yet behind these images is a hidden crisis. Across many of the world's poorest countries, armed conflict is destroying not just school infrastructure, but the hopes and ambitions of generations of children.\"</p></blockquote><p>Focusing on the 35 countries labelled \"conflict-affected\" by researchers at <a href=\"http://www.prio.no/\">Peace Research Institute Oslo</a> (PRIO), the Unesco report provides a snapshot of the state of education amidst the world's conflicts.</p><p>It also provides data on the amount of money spent on education in countries affected by conflict, looking at both national public spending and at international aid flows.<br /> <br /><strong></strong></p><p>According to the report's data, 21 developing countries spend more on arms than on primary schools. Meanwhile, only 2% of humanitarian aid goes towards education (with the vast majority of aid requests for education in conflict-affected states left unfulfilled).</p><p>The consequences are stark. In poor countries affected by conflict:<br /><ul>\n<li>28 million children of primary school age are out of school (42% of the world's total)</li>\n<li>a child is twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday (compared with a child born in a poor but stable country)</li>\n<li>about 30% of the young people aged 15-24 are illiterate (compared with 7% in other poor countries)</li>\n</ul></p><p>The release of new data on the effects of conflict on development could not be more timely.</p><p>In the UK, today also marks the release of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/feb/27/uk-aid-budget-andrew-mitchell\">British government's aid reviews</a>. While a number of countries will no longer receive UK assistance, the reviews echo the commitment by the international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, to increase aid to \"conflict states\".</p><p>But while the Unesco report examines the effects of conflict on education, it criticises donor countries for skewing assistance towards a small group of \"strategic\" countries while neglecting the world's other equally poor and equally conflict-affected countries. While aid for basic education increased more than fivefold in Afghanistan during the past five years, for example, it stagnated or declined in other conflict-affected countries, such as Ivory Coast.</p><p>Beyond this year's special focus on conflict, the Unesco report also updates the world's data looking at progress towards <a href=\"http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=42579&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html\">key international targets on education</a>.</p><p>Globally, more children are going to school than ever before but, according to the report, the number of children out of school is falling far too slowly, and progress is far too varied across the different regions of the world.</p><p>Some key findings:<br /><ul>\n<li>From 1999 to 2008, an additional 52 million children enrolled in primary school. But in 2008, there were still 67 million primary-school age children out of school around the world</li>\n<li>Half-of the world's out-of-school children live in just 15 countries. The largest population of out-of-school children is in Nigeria (8.3 million), followed by Pakistan (7.3 million), India (5.6 million), Ethiopia (2.7 million), and Bangladesh (2 million)</li>\n<li>In sub-Saharan Africa, about 10 million children drop out of school every year</li>\n<li>About 17% of the world's adults – 796 million people – lack basic literacy skills, and nearly two-thirds are women</li>\n<li>The majority of illiterate adults lives in just 10 countries. The largest population of illiterate adults is in India (283 million), followed by China (67 million), Pakistan (51 million), Bangladesh (49 million) and Nigeria (35 million).</li>\n</ul><br />The report includes projections for key indicators on education progress, and finds that – based on current trends – there could be more children out of school in 2015 than there are today. </p><p>It also points to key capacity gaps – for example, that another 1.9 million teachers will be needed by 2015 to achieve universal primary education.</p><p>The report also includes data on money for education – from the amount of public spending at the national level to the amount of international aid to education in developing countries.</p><p>So how do the world's education statistics breakdown?

--><p><strong>Preamble</strong> Hello. Now, I know that, in this past week, I have turned into<em> the boy who cried this will be a decent game honest</em>, but this one <em>has</em> to be. With aggression, rubber-wristed genius and unorthodoxy coursing through both sides, Pakistan and Sri Lanka could not put on a boring game if they tried. (Except that <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63412.html\">bore draw at Faisalabad in 1985-86</a>, but we won't dwell on that. Would you believe I was there for all five days of that game? My first-ever holiday, and I got to watch Qasim Umar make 206 not out from 1211 balls. Dumb luck? Not at all; I loved every last dot ball.)<br /> <br />Anyway, there is good reason to be excited about today. Really excited. Can't-sit-still excited. It's Pakistan, for goodness sake! All sporting contests start as a blank canvas, but with Pakistan the canvas is, er, even blanker. They are so magnificently unpredictable that just about the only thing we can say with absolute certainty about today is that a cricket match will take place.<br /> <br />Pakistan have a magnificent middle order, from Younus Khan at No4 down to Abdur Razzak at No8, while Sri Lanka have Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis, the deadliest spin duo this side of Malcolm Tucker and Jamie. Then there's Shoaib Akhtar, Lasith Malinga, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Umar Gul, Angelo Matthews and the rest. This might not be a contest – Pakistan are well capable of winning or losing by 200 runs or with 200 balls to spare – but it <em>will</em> be entertaining. Promise.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>Shahid Afridi has won the toss</strong> and Pakistan will bat first.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>Team news, aka There Goes That Preamble</strong> Ajantha Mendis is not playing. He's been replaced by Rangana Herath, while Chamara Silva comes in for Chamara Kapugedera. Lasith Malinga has not fully recovered from his back injury. Pakistan are unchanged, so there's still no Saeed Ajmal. Is Abdur Rehman really a better option?</p><p><strong>Sri Lanka</strong> Tharanga, Dilshan, Sangakkara (c/wk), Jayawardene, Samaraweea, Silva, Mathews, Perera, Kulasekera, Herath, Muralitharan.</p><p><strong>Pakistan</strong> Hafeez, Shehzad, K Akmal (wk), Younus, Misbah, U Akmal, Afridi, Razzaq, Gul, Rehman, Akhtar.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>Shoaib Akhtar speaks</strong> \"Never had a doubt for one second about myself. I don't care what people feel. I felt I would make a comeback, and I did. I am a very patriotic man. Nothing else matters to me.\" </p><p>How can you not love Shoaib Akhtar?</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>Pakistan have won all six World Cup matches against Sri Lanka</strong>, but we should read even less than usual into this particular historical statistic, because <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/team/8.html?class=2;filter=advanced;opposition=7;orderby=start;template=results;trophy=12;type=team;view=results\">all six games took place before 1996</a>.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>I watched the first season of Peep Show last night</strong>. As well as being shocked by how different and superior it was in comparison to the last three series, I was reminded of that great episode in which the local kids stalk Mark, and give him the nickname <del>pae</del> 'clean shirt'. <em>\"Clean shirt? What does that even mean? Isn't that good? ...\" </em></p><p>Is this the greatest example of someone being blessed with faint criticism? I can't think of a better one.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>1st over: Pakistan 5-0 (Shehzad 4, Hafeez 0)</strong> There is a fantastic atmosphere at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. This is, of course, a home game for Sri Lanka. Nuwan Kulasekera will open the bowling; he is sixth in the ICC ODI rankings, with Morne Morkel the only seam bowler above him. After three dot balls, the exciting teenager Shehzad walks down the pitch and clatters a boundary through the covers. \"How good was that?\" coos Russel Arnold in the commentary box.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>2nd over: Pakistan 13-0 (Shehzad 11, Hafeez 0)</strong> It'll be Thisara Perera at the other end. Two seamers opening the bowling? Bah, that's <em>so</em> 2007. Perera has a wonderful ODI record – 28 wickets at 19.35 from 17 matches – which brings to mind Tony Gray, the 1980s West Indies quick who had <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/51898.html\">a sub-20 average in <em>both</em> forms of the game</a>. Perera's second ball is a miserable off-side wide; the next delivery is almost as wide and Shehzad, driving, edges it to third man for four. \"Here's praying for really tight game, but the tournament to date suggests otherwise,\" weeps Chris Langmead. \"Despite the knocks that the so-called minnows have taken in the media (admittedly Kenya are awful), the two best games have been Ireland-Bangladesh and Netherlands-Plucky \"We're Just Here To Enjoy The Big Occasion And We'll See What Happens\" England.\"</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>3rd over: Pakistan 13-0 (Shehzad 11, Hafeez 0)</strong> Shehzad has a bit of a swagger about him. He's walking down the track to Kulasekera at every opportunity. Sangakkara responds by standing up to the stumps. Is it me or is that happening more in this tournament? Matt Prior did to for Jimmy Anderson and Brendon McCullum for Tim Southee, two pretty rapid bowlers. It's a maiden from Kulasekera. \"I actually believe it has been a brilliant World Cup thus far - from a rickshaw-laden opening ceremony to a drama-laden Irish booze-fuelled run chase, it's had it all and I haven't missed a ball,\" says Thomas walker. \"This is coming from an Aussie studying in Durham desperate to cling on to any kind of cricketing good news. Also big hi to my college celebrating Chad's day - get your green on in support.\" How did you know what grundies I'm wearing?</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>4th over: Pakistan 20-0 (Shehzad 11, Hafeez 7)</strong> Hafeez faced only two balls in the first three overs, but he gets his turn now and drives Perera classily through the covers for four to get off the mark. The general consensus is that this is a decent toss to win, and that a score of around 270 is par. This is going to be a cracking game. \"Imran Khan has called the non-selection of Ajmal (and wasting Razzaq at No8) cowardly,\" says Sana Kazmi, \"and has urged Afridi to be Tipu Sultan, not Bahadur Shah Zafar.\" That's as good an excuse as any to post this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc1HC8CDkEc\">wonderful little clip</a>.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>5th over: Pakistan 28-0 (Shehzad 13, Hafeez 12)</strong> Mohammad Hafeez forces Nuwan Kulasekera's last delivery behind point for four to continue Pakistan's good start. \"I need a clarification,\" says Nigam. \"Is there a PCB rule that says no Pakistani debutant can be older than 18? How do they pick the young ones? At PTA meetings?\" Ha. There was Saeed Ajmal I suppose, but it's a fair point.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>WICKET! Pakistan 28-1 (Shehzad c Sangakkara b Perera 13)</strong> Shehzad has gone. He essayed a booming drive at a lifting leg-cutter from Perera and edged through to Sangakkara. Shehzad is on one, cussing furiously at himself as he walks off, but he shouldn't be too angry because that was a jaffa from Perera.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>6th over: Pakistan 31-1 (Hafeez 12, K Akmal 3)</strong> \"Having seen how wonderfully composed this opening pair of rookies are, I'll take issue with Pakistan being called The Unpredictables,\" says Shankar Kalyanaraman. \"Somehow, and this can only happen to them, Pakistan has managed to forged a stee.. oh damn.\" I love Pakistan. They are the most interesting and soulful team in sport, ever. All World Cups, in all sports, should include the Pakistan cricket team.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>7th over: Pakistan 42-1 (Hafeez 22, K Akmal 3)</strong> Wasim Akram is in the commentary box, which is as good an excuse as any to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O5rVGc3XfY\">post this amazing clip</a>. Whoever is doing the OBO in the year 2026 might post a clip of that Hafeez shot, a mighty slog sweep for six off Kulasekera that went a long way back into the crowd. He makes it ten from two balls with an extravagant, premeditated lap over short fine leg. That's beautifully played.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>8th over: Pakistan 47-1 (Hafeez 22, K Akmal 8)</strong> Kamran Akmal gets his first boundary with a wristy whip through midwicket off Perera. Then he reaches for a wide one and edges it safely on the bounce to third man. \"Shoaib Akhtar. Curling,\" says Andrew Thomas. \"It makes sense.\" I'm coming round to this idea. And why stop at sports? Imagine the drama Shahid Afridi could bring to a chess match, especially if he started biting his opponent's king.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>9th over: Pakistan 59-1 (Hafeez 23, K Akmal 19)</strong> Twelve from the over. This is great stuff from Pakistan. Kamran Akmal gets Kulasekera's attempted yorker on the full and feathers it through extra cover for four. He waits for the next delivery, a slower one, and drives it through point for three off the back foot. And finally he pings another cover drive for four. \"Where does Umar Akmal rate on your scale of fantastic young batting prodigies?\" says Nisarg Kamdar. \"Has had some good knocks for the senior team, looks to have sound head on his shoulders, something a rarity these days in Pakistani cricket.\" I can only really go on his performances in England last summer, when he looked like he <em>didn't</em> have a sound head on young shoulders. But he certainly looked like the most naturally talented under-21 batsman around by a fair distance.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>10th over: Pakistan 65-1 (Hafeez 29, K Akmal 19)</strong> Perera sneaks a swinging lifter past the outside edge of the groping Hafeez, who nods respectfully back at the bowler and then shows no respect whatsoever by walking across his stumps to flick the next delivery to fine leg for four. What a fantastic first 10 overs we have had.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>11th over: Pakistan 66-1 (Hafeez 29, K Akmal 20)</strong> Angelo Matthews replaces Kulasekera (5-1-33-0) and Sri Lanka take the bowling Powerplay. I'd have been tempted to hold it back and give Murali a couple of overs and then take it when a wicket falls. It's a bit of a by-numbers Plan B but it does often work. Anyway, Mathews has a big shout for LBW against Akmal turned down by Daryl Harper. Sri Lanka decide not to go for the review; it appeared to hit him outside the line. A good over from Mathews, one from it.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>12th over: Pakistan 73-1 (Hafeez 30, K Akmal 25)</strong> Kulasekera has changed ends but he is still going round the park. Kamran Akmal drives his first ball contemptuously over mid off for four, and there are seven from the over. \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0UkzDtBZlw\">How could you forget this video</a>?\" says Huma Imtiaz. \"Against Sri Lanka too.\" Oh my, that's a great video. To be hit in the box once is unfortunate...</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>13th over: Pakistan 76-1 (Hafeez 32, K Akmal 26)</strong> Mathews is employing all his variations, particularly of pace, and there are three singles from the over.<br />\"Here's a plug for the wonderful <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/StudentVolunteerArmy\">University of Canterbury's Student Volunteer Army</a>, which has been at the fore of relief and rehabilitation efforts at Christchurch?\" says Shankar Kalyanaraman. Yep, the work they are doing is pretty incredible.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>WICKET! Pakistan 76-2 (Mohammad Hafeez run out 32)</strong> What a farce. This is an extraordinary run-out. Hafeez swept Murali's first ball to short fine leg and barely left his crease, even though Kamral Akmal had bolted down down the wicket towards him. Hafeez was ballwatching and went nowhere. The man at short fine leg sent the ball to Sangakkara, who then sent a shocking throw to Murali at the non-striker's end. It went over his head, but thankfully for Sri Lanka there was time for the man backing up to collect and send the ball back to Murali, who broke the stumps. Nobody seemed to know who was out, and both batsmen were standing there in it-wasn't-me-it-was-him mode, like two kids getting a rollocking from their parents because one of them had smashed the jar of marmalade all over the floor. Eventually the umpires decided that Hafeez was the man to go.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>14th over: Pakistan 78-2 (K Akmal 27, Younus Khan 1)</strong> So Murali takes a wicket with his first ball, but not quite as we might have expected. \"To counter Huma Imtiaz (12th over),\" begins Nadir Hassan, \"the greatest Sri Lanka-Pakistan battle was actually at the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ6nQNd4D4E\">Benson and Hedges Cup Final in 1995.\"</a> Are you trying to make me weep lukewarm tears? Poor Arry. What an innings that was; although, odd as it sounds, the main individual contests I remember from that game were Aravinda v Ian Austin and David Fulton v Wasim, rather than Aravinda v Wasim.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>15th over: Pakistan 79-2 (K Akmal 27, Younus Khan 2)</strong> A good over from Mathews, just one from it. Time for a drinks break. \"I'm following you but watching Super 15 rugby,\" says Sarah Bacon. \"I fully intend upon switching over to CricOne 'live from Colombo' after the Tahs tear a new one out of those Queenslanders however. Weekends are chockers in these parts, what with Six Nations, WC Cricket, Super 15 and more ... What's today's riff then?\" Heaven knows. Cricket?</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>16th over: Pakistan 82-2 (K Akmal 28, Younus Khan 4)</strong> Murali off, Kulasekera on, presumably to bowl a couple of cheap overs while Younus Khan plays himself in. Just three low-risk singles from that over, and Sri Lanka have dragged this back very well. The last four overs have brought nine runs and a wicket.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>17th over: Pakistan 89-2 (K Akmal 29, Younus Khan 10)</strong> Younus Khan eases the top half of his body to leg and steers a short one from Mathews wide of the diving Sangakkara for four. It was a bit too close for comfort, but ultimately I think he had it under control. \"Had tickets, running charity in Sri Lanka, won a competition... so far great.... had to come back to the UK to drive the new Ford Focus around for 6 weeks to guarantee $10,000 for Tea Leaf Trust...\" says Tim Pare. \"Problem is my wife is half Pakistani/half-Irish and now at the game singing and dancing and sending texts that suggest cricket expertise and a hereby unknown skill for gloating... me, 37 years old, back at home with my parents... no Sky! Challenge started just before first match and ends just after final... had tickets for all big games in Sri Lanka. Oh woe is me.\" Now that <em>is</em> dumb luck.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>18th over: Pakistan 92-2 (K Akmal 30, Younus Khan 12)</strong> Rangana Herath, the ageing eft-arm spinner who has been selected ahead of Ajantha Mendis, is coming on. He starts with an over that costs three singles. I smell Boring Middle Overs. \"I have a number of USian friends online to whom, over the years, I have explained the fascinating British eccentricity that is cricket (too involved to get into the whole colonial thing and explain why it's a world sport - they read Wodehouse and are fascinated by our nonsense and that's enough for now),\" says Ravi Nair. \"So can you or the other readers, suggest any short, sharp reflections on this game that might make sense to them? (Bear in mind they're awfully clever people and already know the difference between this and baseball, say.)\" Me: no. Readers: maybe. Well?</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>19th over: Pakistan 102-2 (K Akmal 37, Younus Khan 15)</strong> A rare bad ball from the hitherto excellent Mathews is flicked to fine leg for four by Kamran Akmal, who flashes the next delivery through extra cover for two more. That's a very good over from Pakistan, 10 from it. This game is beautifully poised. I have no idea who is in the ascendancy. \"Further riffing on nostalgic 90s footage; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dZVUkCTG0M&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\">some more examples of just how good Wasim was</a>,\" says Chris Langmead. \"The show was, however, stolen by The Doyen Of Commentators with his precise description of Devon Malcolm's innings.\" Ha, that is a majestic piece of quick-witted commentary, well worth clicking the link for. It's at 2.10, although you should watch the whole clip to see the genius of Wasim.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>20th over: Pakistan 105-2 (K Akmal 38, Younus Khan 16)</strong> Murali is back, eyes ablaze and wrist boinging  as he sizes up two more suckers. Three singles from the over. \"I totally agree with your comments in the 6th over,\" says Devika Pande. \"Just watching Pakistan playing (and occasionally not playing) cricket makes us all better people.\" Somebody should make a film about them, although it would make Once Upon a Time in America seem like a short by comparison.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>WICKET! Pakistan 105-3 (K Akmal b Herath 39)</strong> Bloody hell, what sort of a shot is this? Kamran Akmal comes flying down the wicket to Herath's second ball and tries to deposit it into the crowd at deep midwicket. He's beaten in the flight and misses the ball completely, allowing Kumar Sangakkara to complete the easiest of stumpings. That's a desperate shot from Akmal, but we shouldn't be <em>too</em> harsh – it's just the way he plays. You can't have your cake and eat it; or, indeed, celebrate the flamingo shots and then slag off the bird-brained ones. Just enjoy it. This is Pakistan, and already we've had almost as much entertainment than in the other matches of this tournament combined.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>21st over: Pakistan 106-3 (Younus Khan 16, Misbah-ul-Haq 1)</strong> Herath will be 33 before this tournament is over – and 34, and 35 – yet this is only 12th ODI.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>22nd over: Pakistan 109-3 (Younus Khan 17, Misbah-ul-Haq 3)</strong> Misbah takes a dodgy single to short fine leg, and Younus might have been in trouble but for a misfield from Jayawardene. I have no idea how you score off Murali, even in the middle overs, and Pakistan are struggling. Three from the over and Murali has figures of 3-0-8-0.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>23rd over: Pakistan 113-3 (Younus Khan 18, Misbah-ul-Haq 6)</strong> Four from Herath's over. How many times have we seen Pakistan do this, get off to a flyer and then lose the plot completely. \"Bull is quoting Radiohead on Twitter to describe this Pakistani innings,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"Surely they are not that bad. More like Sleeper in my view - attractive, promising but often disappointing.\" I smell riffoonery!</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>24th over: Pakistan 117-3 (Younus Khan 20, Misbah-ul-Haq 8)</strong> Four singles from Murali's over. \"Your photo caption has alerted me to a new satellite programme I wasn't aware of,\" says Phil Russell. \"Is 'Dancing on Ince' the first in a series of shows featuring former professional sportspeople, and what else is in the pipeline? Off the top of my head I anticipate Take your Hick, Neale or no Deal, and O Fairbrother Where Art Thou?\"</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>25th over: Pakistan 123-3 (Younus Khan 23, Misbah-ul-Haq 11)</strong> Tony Greig points out that Ajantha Mendis has probably been left out because <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/268739.html?class=11;opposition=7;template=results;type=bowling\">Pakistan have got his number</a>, which is a very good point and something I'd completely forgotten about. His replacement, Herath, is doing a fine job and after another boundaryless over he has figures of 4-0-13-1.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>26th over: Pakistan 127-3 (Younus Khan 25, Misbah-ul-Haq 13)</strong> Four singles from Muraii's over. These are Boring Middle Overs, Pakistan-style: the same things happen, but we have the tantalising knowledge that something absurd or brilliant could happen off any given delivery. \"Here's Lord Bane's explanation of cricket,\" says Phil Dobbin. \" Cricket: As explained to a foreigner... You have two sides, one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out, and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes in until he's out. When they are all out, the side that's out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out. When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in. There are two men called umpires who stay out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out. When both sides have been in and all the men have been out, and both sides have been out twice after all the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game.\"</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>27th over: Pakistan 132-3 (Younus Khan 27, Misbah-ul-Haq 16)</strong> Mathews replaces Herath, and Pakistan continue to milk four and five singles an over. Younus is a master at this – mainly because, as Tony Greig points out on Sky, his placement is so good. This is expert middle-over batting from two veterans with a combined age of 69.<br />\"Pakistan are Fleetwood Mac surely,\" says Ravi Nair. \"Splits, fights, changes of personnel and frequent genius? A soap opera of a cricket team...\" I thought Fleetwood Mac were a rock band? HONK! HO-HONK!</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>28th over: Pakistan 142-3 (Younus Khan 31, Misbah-ul-Haq 22)</strong> The part-time off spinner Tillekeratne Dilshan is greeted with a reverse sweep for four by Misbah, the first boundary in eight overs. The remaining five deliveries bring six more. This is excellent stuff from these two, really classy and canny batting.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>29th over: Pakistan 150-3 (Younus Khan 37, Misbah-ul-Haq 24)</strong> More lovely batting from Younus, who rolls the wrists to touch a slower ball from Mathews very fine for four. \"Surely Pakistan are Spinal Tap?\" says Niall Mullen. \"They have the ability to crank it up to eleven but are just as likely to play second billing to a puppet show.\"</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>30th over: Pakistan 154-3 (Younus Khan 39, Misbah-ul-Haq 26)</strong> Sri Lanka need a wicket, so Sangakkara brings back Murali. Pakistan have played him well thus far, taking very few risks. Misrah works a lifting doosra to long on for a single, one of four in the over. \"Any word on bowlers' idiosyncratic celebrations yet?\" says John Starbuck. \"Watching the highlights on the Beeb last night I was impressed by Mohammed Ashraful: a shadow-boxing routine with lots of close work to the body. Anderson's Anteater mode would be good to see again tomorrow, as it would mean he's not been dropped for a 'spinner' and has taken a wicket.\" Surely he would only be dropped for Shahzad, not Yardy? If Yardy comes in it has to be for Bopara.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>31st over: Pakistan 156-3 (Younus Khan 40, Misbah-ul-Haq 27)</strong> That's the fifty partnership, a very accomplished effort that, despite containing only two boundaries, has come from just 60 balls. Two from Herath's over.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>32nd over: Pakistan 160-3 (Younus Khan 42, Misbah-ul-Haq 29)</strong> Pakistan have dealt exclusively in singles against Murali – 22 from seven overs, including four more there. It's a very sensible approach and one that has set up them up for a big assault at the death. If Afridi or Razzaq come off, they will probably reach 300. \"Your poster may do well to gift Keith Dunstan's, A Cricket Dictionaryto his friends, if it is still in print,\" says Bebe Nanno. \"'<em>Cricket (Crikk-itt in Englan, criggit in Australia)</em>. Like living in igloos, skateboarding and eating tripe, unless taught at birth, remains forever unfathomable as Nuclear Physics.' My (Spanish) husband might have been an exception to this rule, however, as he got quite enthusiastic about the game....\" Spanish? What's the cricket equivalent of tiki taka?</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>33rd over: Pakistan 164-3 (Younus Khan 44, Misbah-ul-Haq 31)</strong> Four more singles. Deja vu. \"That 1992 England team was genius, genuinely great,\" says Ben Dunn. \"The batting line up had some great players, the bowling had everything – and why Mallender only ever got to play the two Tests is beyond me.  I wonder what Andy Flower could have made of that lot.\" I hear it's his biggest regret in cricket that he never got to work with Tim Munton and Ian Salisbury.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>34th over: Pakistan 170-3 (Younus Khan 49, Misbah-ul-Haq 32)</strong> A poor delivery from the returning Thisara Perera is flicked to fine leg for four by Younus Khan. That was much needed after just a couple too many dot balls in the last few overs. We now have the mandatory ball change, but first it's time for a drinks break.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>35th over: Pakistan 174-3 (Younus Khan 51, Misbah-ul-Haq 34)</strong> Younus drives Herath to long on to reach a classy and unobtrusive half-century, from 56 balls and with fours. His rotation of the strike has been immaculate. There's a nice chat in the commentary box, with Rameez Raja and Wasim Akram both eulogising the captaincy of Imran Khan. There is a lovely reverence in their voices, and some nice detail too. \"He never allowed you eat a burger...\" says Rameez. \"Wasim would hide in the corner and make sure nobody saw him eating a burger.\" Four singles from the over. \"Bebe Nanno's idea sounds interesting (albeit I have never read it and it appears to be out of print),\" says Ravi Nair. \"Does anybody know if it, or any other text, might engender in them that same transcendental elation I feel when there's cricket about? I've already explained in some detail what it means to bowl length, short, full etc and the reasons therefore. I have, of course, sensibly refused to interrupt their fledgling steps with an attempt to explain LBW or Duckworth/Lewis.\"</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>36th over: Pakistan 176-3 (Younus Khan 52, Misbah-ul-Haq 36)</strong> Three singles from that Perera over. The last was a very dodgy one to midwicket, and Younus probably would have been out with a direct hit. That's unlike these two, whose judgement of singles has been first class in this partnership. \"I've just realised that <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/content/current/player/49178.html\">Herath's first name is also 'Herath'</a>,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"How many other double-monickered people have there been? I'll start you with Sirhan Sirhan, Sylvain Sylvain and, of course, Neville Neville.\" Lulu? Sorry.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>37th over: Pakistan 185-3 (Younus Khan 54, Misbah-ul-Haq 41)</strong> Herath slips a gorgeous carrom ball – Tom Moody said it was the carrom ball, and he should know – through Misbah's gate, past off stump and also through Sangakkara for three byes. The usual ones and twos make it nine from the over. This has been a textbook example of middle-overs batting, quite outstanding in its cool maturity, but soon it will time for them to 'go'. \"Tiki taka?\" begins Sam Tarr. \"I reckon we're witnessing the cricket equivalent right now... lots of neat singles and sensible running, with always the feeling Pakistan have it within themselves to not push on or, more probably, self-destruct.\"</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>38th over: Pakistan 193-3 (Younus Khan 58, Misbah-ul-Haq 46)</strong> Younus pulls a short one from Mathews into the gap for a couple, and then Misbah flicks a slower ball to fine leg for three. I can't praise these two highly enough for the way they have played. It's almost impossible to score at five an over by taking as few risks as Younus and Misbah have. \"In case you were wondering how to score off Murali,\" says Sana Kazmi. \"<a href=\"http://youtu.be/7HjTub474K4\">This is from the last time SL and Pakistan played each other</a>. Best Afridi innings ever, though we still lost.\"</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>39th over: Pakistan 203-3 (Younus Khan 67, Misbah-ul-Haq 47)</strong> This is a stunning stroke from Younus Khan, a perfectly placed drive over extra cover off the bowling off Herath. That probably signals a gear change, and there are 10 runs from the over. There have been so few dot balls in this partnership.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>40th over: Pakistan 209-3 (Younus Khan 71, Misbah-ul-Haq 48)</strong> The hundred partnership comes up from only 114 balls, despite containing only five fours. I'm a broken record but this has been a wonderful partnership in its own quiet way. Six from Murali's over, again all in ones and twos. \"Same first and last name,\" says some fellow called Malc Millings. \"Well, there's Humbert Humbert out of Lolita. That's all I have. I am an empty shell.\"</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>WICKET! Pakistan 213-4 (Younus c Jayawardene b Herath 72)</strong> Herath tosses one up and Younus top-edges a sweep straight to Jayawardene, running round to his right from short fine leg. Younus played a brilliant innings, 72 from 76 balls, but his dismissal might be a mixed blessing for Sri Lanka, because it exposes Pakistan's triumvirate of death hitters.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>41st over: Pakistan 213-4 (Misbah-ul-Haq 51, Umar Akmal 0)</strong> Umar Akmal, trying to reverse sweep his first delivery, survives an LBW appeal from Herath – but Sri Lanka have <strong>gone for the review</strong>. It's a preposterous review, because Akmal got a big top edge into his throat. Herath ends with figures of 10-0-46-2, which more than justify his selection over Ajantha Mendis. </p><p>\"Not to flog any site, but I <a href=\"http://www.betterworldbooks.com/a-cricket-dictionary-id-0715386123.aspx\">have found copies here</a> (the book's Australian by the way),\" says Bebe Nanno. \"I did pick it up cheap in a London bookshop, but that might have been because it was in the 1980's... You might be interested in the entry on commentator</p><blockquote><p>He's venerable. His eyesight is not as good as it was in 1938 but it's remarkable how he can still pick an inswinger or an outswinger from 200 metres. What's going on in the centre can be a wretched inconvenience when he's just recalling that marvellous incident on the 4th day of the 5th Test at the Oval in 1948. he is superb at describing seagulls, and most graceful when at 5 p.m. he refers to the long shadows moving across the ground. At 6 p.m. during the summing up he can actually cause a shock by referring to the day's play</p></blockquote><p>\"</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>42nd over: Pakistan 218-4 (Misbah-ul-Haq 53, Umar Akmal 3)</strong> A really good over from Kulasekera costs only five, none in boundaries. At the end of the over, Umar Akmal is warned for jumping on the wicket. He had run down the track before the ball had bowled and then landed heavily on a length. I think that's a bit harsh. \"Same first and last name?\" says Phil Dobbin. \"OBO?\" Out. Get out.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>43rd over: Pakistan 224-4 (Misbah-ul-Haq 58, Umar Akmal 4)</strong> Shehzad has come out as a runner for Misbah, although nobody is sure why. Just two from the first five bowlers of a canny over by Mathews, but then Misbah comes down the track to blast a full toss back whence it came for four. This has been a really good game, full of barely perceptible momentum shifts. I would say Pakistan are still on top, but only just. \"My great-great grandfather had the rather excellent name of James Spargo James,\" says Niall Harden. \"<strong>WOW</strong>, eh?\" I can give you a '<strong>COR</strong>', but I reckon I might save my '<strong>WOW</strong>'s for when the criminal is unmasked in Murder, She Wrote.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>44th over: Pakistan 226-4 (Misbah-ul-Haq 59, Umar Akmal 5)</strong> Pakistan take the <strong>batting Powerplay</strong>, so Kumar Sangakkara turns straight to Murali, who has two overs remaining. His first ball gates the driving Akmal and misses off stump by an nth of a millimetre, and he concedes just two singles from a simply brilliant over. \"If we're into the fictional characters,\" says John Starbuck, \"what about Major Major Major (rank: Major) in Catch-22?\"</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>45th over: Pakistan 237-4 (Misbah-ul-Haq 65, Umar Akmal 10)</strong> The second over of the Powerplay, from Kulasekera, goes for 11. Misbah premeditates a superb boundary from the third ball, walking across his stumps and pinging the ball through midwicket, and then Akmal makes room outside <em>leg</em> to smash an attempted yorker square on the off side for four more off the last ball of the over.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>WICKET! Pakistan 238-5 (Umar Akmal c Dilshan b Muralitharan 10)</strong> Umar Akmal pulls Murali to deep midwicket, where Dilshan takes a fine tumbling catch as the ball dies on him. Akmal didn't quite get going – 10 from 15 balls – but it was far from easy against Murali, who is bowling beautifully. So far he has conceded three runs from nine balls in the Powerplay.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>46th over: Pakistan 240-5 (Misbah-ul-Haq 67, Shahid Afridi 0)</strong> Afridi misses a comic swipe at his first delivery. Just three from Murali's over, so his Powerplay figures are 2-0-5-1 and his overall figures are 10-0-35-1, with not a single boundary off his bowling. Magnificent stuff.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>47th over: Pakistan 245-5 (Misbah-ul-Haq 68, Shahid Afridi 4)</strong> Sri Lanka have bowled sensationally in this Powerplay and another superb over from Kulasekera, full of unhittable yorkers, costs only five. It could have been even better, but Afridi wiped the last ball over midwicket for a one-bounce four to get off the mark. \"Does Maurice Morris count?\" says Sam Willis. \"American football star. What a name!\" I think <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/279540.html\">this chap has my favourite name</a>.</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>48th over: Pakistan 260-5 (Misbah-ul-Haq 73, Shahid Afridi 14)</strong> The last over of the Powerplay, from Thisara Perera, disappears for 15, including three boundaries. Misbah walks across his stumps to whap through square leg; Afridi waits and carts a slower ball over extra cover; and then he larrups a yorker through the same region. He would have had another boundary but for a brilliant save by Chamara Silva at long off. Sri Lanka's ground fielding has been superb.</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>WICKET! Pakistan 267-6 (Afridi c Dilshan b Mathews 16)</strong> Afridi's cheery cameo of 16 from 12 balls comes to an end when he scoops a low full toss from Mathews to <br />point. Seven deliveries to go.</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>49th over: Pakistan 267-6 (Misbah-ul-Haq 78, Abdul Razzaq 0)</strong> Mathews gets away with a widish delivery to Razzaq, so that means his last over went for only seven, a fine effort. \"Knowing someone who works for a truly global news company means that I've seen the great names in their email address book, including: Supa Porn, Bent-Over Bjorn and Randy Guy,\" says Jeremy Theobald. \"But <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Baumgardner\">this is probably my favourite name</a>.\"</p><!-- Block 62 --><p><strong>50th over: Pakistan 277-7 (Abdul Razzaq c sub b Perera 3; Misbah 83 not out)</strong> Yet again Misbah premeditates a boundary through square leg, walking across his stumps to rifle Perera to the fence. That's the only boundary of the final over, which yields 10 runs and also the wicket of Razzaq, who slogged the last ball of the innings straight up in the air. Sri Lanka did really well in those last 10 overs, restricting Pakistan to 68, but their <strong>target of 278</strong> is a stiff one. This should be a cracking run chase. See you in 30 minutes.</p><!-- Block 63 --><p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p><!-- Block 64 --><<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aC_Mids6IQ\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aC_Mids6IQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure>p> <strong>Some soothing music</strong> while you wait.</p><!-- Block 65 --><p><strong>1st over: Sri Lanka 2-0 (target 278; Tharanga 1, Dilshan 0)</strong> Shoaib Akhtar, 35 going on 80 but still capable of producing an irresistible force, is going to open the bowling. In tribute to the great man, here's that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9O7HHHHLyk\">storming yorker from the 1999 World Cup</a>. His first ball too Dilshan is a good one that seams past the inside-edge of Dilshan's massive swipe. Later in the over he beats Tharanga with a fuller, wider delivery. A very lively first over, just two from it. \"For Ravi Nair,\" begins Paul Szabo. \"I'm not sure if it will help with the names of cricket fielders, but in baseball when we don't know the name of someone playing the game, we ask Messrs.

He has no sort of pace but is very accurate, and his first over is a maiden to Dilshan. If Sri Lanka win it will be a record chase on this ground, beating India's effort against England in the 2002 Champions Trophy – when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1i8EiT3H8w\">Sehwag and Ganguly savaged the England bowlers</a>. \"This is where my nephew will be perched for the India-England tomorrow, having somehow got selected for this (<a href=\"http://www.pepsichangethegame.com/ctgxi.php\">the tall chap in the centre</a>),\" says Bebe Nanno. \"Not exactly sure what exactly they are supposed to be doing, but the 11 of them are being flown to matches around the subcontinent, courtesy of Pepsi. Perhaps he was <a href=\"http://www.gkhamba.com/2011/01/saurav-gangulys-ebay-listing.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%253A+KhambasBlog+%2528Khamba%2527s+Blog%2529\">picked for this</a>, among other qualities.\" How cool is that. You must be extremely proud.</p><!-- Block 67 --><p><strong>3rd over: Sri Lanka 8-0 (target 278; Tharanga 6, Dilshan 1)</strong> Tharanga, feeling outside off stump with a crooked bat, edges a hot one from Akhtar for four. Then Tom Moody, who has been an excellent addition to the commentary box in this tournament, talks us through the frustrations of coaching a loose cannon like Dilshan. His conclusion: just let him be, basically, because you've got no chance of making him play a responsible innings.<br />\"Most of us are still at lunch,\" says John Starbuck. \"I'm contenting myself with a bit of blueberry jam on toast so as to pick up the coverage. I feel I deserve this as I've just fixed a couple of curtain-poles which were coming adrift from the wall. Which is better, wood or steel?\" Err, talking of lunch, I only had time to go over the road to the petrol station. This meant the usual problem: <del>Roast Beef or Flamin' Hot Monster Munch</del> when you buy just food/drink from a petrol station, and they ask you 'any petrol?', how should you respond? If you just say 'no' it seems curt and rude, but if you say 'no thanks' it suggests you're so stupid that you thought they were actually offering you petrol over the counter. What's a fella to do?</p><!-- Block 68 --><p><strong>4th over: Sri Lanka 13-0 (target 278; Tharanga 10, Dilshan 2)</strong> Dilshan, who is skittish even by his usual standards, uppercuts Razzaq on the bounce to third man, before Tharanga plays a sumptuous drive through extra cover for four. This is going to be a <em>brilliant</em> match; you can smell it. \"How can anyone confuse Laurel &amp; Hardy (1st over) with those Abbot &amp; Costello twerps?\" says John Starbuck, not unreasonably.</p><!-- Block 69 --><p><strong>5th over: Sri Lanka 16-0 (target 278; Tharanga 11, Dilshan 4)</strong> Shoaib has started really well, right on the money at around 88mph. Dilshan is squared up by a beauty and edges over point for a single. \"Buy some petrol, avoid the embarrassment,\" says Steve Churnin. \" I always carry a little empty can around with me in case I feel the need for some Chewits.\" That tactic comes from the same stable as teenagers buying £20's worth of toiletries and cough sweets in an attempt to disguise the fact they are also buying some condoms.</p><!-- Block 70 --><p><strong>6th over: Sri Lanka 26-0 (target 278; Tharanga 12, Dilshan 13)</strong> Dilshan gets his first boundary with a fine stroke, driving a perfectly decent delivery through extra cover for four. He lines up a big drive at the next ball and snicks it right through the vacant slip area for four. Should he have had a slip? Probably, but it's easy to say that now that the horse has bolted off into the middle distance to make babies with other horses. An eventful over ends when Tharanga takes a suicidal single. He would have been out had Hafeez (I think) at square leg hit the stumps at the bowler's end.</p><!-- Block 71 --><p><strong>7th over: Sri Lanka 27-0 (target 278; Tharanga 13, Dilshan 14)</strong> Another fine over from Shoaib. He's sweating at a rate that could fill a swimming pool in a couple of minutes, but he has been very accurate. Just two singles from that over and his figures are 4-0-12-10. \"Any petrol?\" says Niall Harden, though hopefully not in the David Brent 'Any mail?' voice. \"I like to say no in a really shifty way, suggesting that actually I'd had lots of petrol but that the hapless shopkeep, by introducing the element of doubt and the potential for crime, has done themselves out of £10.01. Leaves them rattled, it does.\" And leaves the bars on your new shiny cell rattling as well, I'd imagine.</p><!-- Block 72 --><p><strong>8th over: Sri Lanka 29-0 (target 278; Tharanga 13, Dilshan 15)</strong> Umar Gul is on for Abdul Razzaq. Dilshan misses a windy woof outside off stump. He hasn't middled much thus far. Wasim Akram politely criticises Shahid Afridi for his habit of talking to his bowlers after every delivery – pointing out that, while that's fine with young bowlers, there is no need to do it with men as experienced as Shoaib, Razzaq and Gul. It's an obvious point but one many viewers won't have picked up. The enthusiasm, insight and respect for the viewer evident in cricket commentary is streets ahead of football. \"You use the ordinary forms of English discourse,\" begins John Starbuck, \"and avoid paying for petrol by saying 'Not today, thank you', thus conveying that, on another day, you just might.\" But surely the 'thank you' suggests that you think they are offering petrol over the counter? As in 'any crisps/serotonin to go with that?' when you buy a pint of Liver Compromiser.</p><!-- Block 73 --><p><strong>9th over: Sri Lanka 35-0 (target 278; Tharanga 14, Dilshan 20)</strong> Dilshan flashes those fast hands at a short ball from Shoaib and it flies high over the slips for four. Six from the over, and the required rate is now 5.92. \"That clip of Sehwag back in 2002 got me thinking,\" says Jonny Sultoon. \"That was the one and only time he scored a ODI century vs England. The same year his one and only test century vs England. Apart from that marmalising at Chennai in 08, Viru has been kept pretty quiet by 'our gallant boys'. Probably adds to him being underappreciated on these shores. Here's hoping for a 76-ball 134* but a loss tomorrow.\" Agreed. He was dropped in 2007, is that right? So we haven't seen much of him in this country, which is where (sadly) judgements are often formed. Sehwag did play one fine innings in 2002 but that series was all about Rahul Dravid.</p><!-- Block 74 --><p><strong>10th over: Sri Lanka 42-0 (target 278; Tharanga 20, Dilshan 21)</strong> Tharanga cuts Gul for four, a gorgeous shot, and is then beaten by a cracking lifter that roars from a length and is taken high above his head by Kamran Akmal.</p><!-- Block 75 --><p><strong>11th over: Sri Lanka 48-0 (target 278; Tharanga 24, Dilshan 21)</strong> Shahid Afridi takes the bowling Powerplay and gives the ball to the off spinner Mohammad Hafeez. He bowls a couple of leg-side wides to Tharanga, who then rocks back to cut nicely to third man for four. Sri Lanka are building some momentum, and the atmosphere in the R. Premadasa Stadium is wonderful.</p><!-- Block 76 --><p><strong>12th over: Sri Lanka 64-0 (target 278; Tharanga 24, Dilshan 31)</strong> Sri Lanka scored 29 from the first eight overs and have taken 35 from four since then, including 16 from that Umar Gul over. Dilshan plays two fast-handed cuts for four, the second off the edge and over slip, and then a frustrated Gul sends down a front-foot no-ball followed by a bouncer that goes over Akmal's head for five wides. \"The reason to thank the attendant is not for offering but for asking and thereby checking that you hadn't forgotten,\" says Tom Baird. \"Thus the correct response is 'Any petrol?', 'No, (but) thank you (for asking).'  The words in brackets are usually omitted but are implicit.  As long as you say thank you are covering yourself – especially important when you have actually put diesel in the car but don't want to pay for it.\" I still the 'thank you' implies that you are responding to a question along the lines of 'Would you like some petrol, over the counter, in a little bottle, to do with what you will behind closed doors?' rather than 'Have you put petrol in your car but forgotten to mention it?'</p><!-- Block 77 --><p><strong>13th over: Sri Lanka 68-0 (target 278; Tharanga 28, Dilshan 31)</strong> Akmal appeals for a stumping when Tharanga is beaten by a jaffa from Hafeez, but Tharanga's back foot did not twitch and the umpire felt no need to go upstairs. Tharanga's is a lovely drive over mid on for four. \"Buy a coke can with other things and, referring to it, say: 'No, thanks. I think this would do',\" suggests Utkarsh Sharma.</p><!-- Block 78 --><p><strong>14th over: Sri Lanka 72-0 (target 278; Tharanga 29, Dilshan 34)</strong> Pakistan need a wicket. Afridi goes back to Razzaq, as Amy Winehouse didn't say, and Dilshan clatters a pull for two. Four from the over. \"Uhrrrrrrrr,\" says John Starbuck. \"Yes, of course you give the impression you think they're offering to sell you petrol over the counter. Thus, you point up how idiotic they are to ask in that particular way, whilst also conveying that you're a whole lot more sophisticated than they are. Though if you're only buying bags of crisps that might undermine your cool pose. Perhaps it's time to end this particular thread?\" It got us through 10 overs, which is more than can be said for the world-famous Kapila Wijegunawardene riff of 2007.</p><!-- Block 79 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 76-1 (Tharanga c Afridi b Hafeez 33)</strong> Boy did Pakistan need that. Tharanga rifles a drive to the right of Afridi at extra cover, and he takes a smart catch before letting out a primeval roar as he flings the ball to the heavens.</p><!-- Block 80 --><p><strong>15th over: Sri Lanka 78-1 (target 278; Dilshan 35, Sangakkara 1)</strong> \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/feb/26/bradford-tottenham-hotspur\">Very sad about Dean Richards</a>,\" says Ian Copestake.  It's shocking.</p><!-- Block 81 --><p><strong>16th over: Sri Lanka 82-1 (target 278; Dilshan 37, Sangakkara 3)</strong> Four singles from Razzaq's over. At this stage of their innings, Pakistan were 82 for two. The match is perched as beautifully as Simon Adebisi's hat. \"You really do just have to love Afridi, don't you Rob?\" says Clare Davies. \"What a celebratory shout, head back, wild eyes etc. Anyone would think it was the winning catch of the final. Gorgeous.\"</p><!-- Block 82 --><p><strong>17th over: Sri Lanka 86-1 (target 278; Dilshan 40, Sangakkara 4)</strong> Things I never wanted to hear, ever: Tony Greig talking about foot massages and \"smelly, wonderful oils\". Apparently the commentators all get a professional foot massage when they're off duty, and in fact we've just been treated (sic) to a quick video of Tony Greig, Tom Moody and Alan Wilkins enjoying theirs. There was even the porno-staple soft, sensual background music. Eugh! Four from Hafeez's over.</p><!-- Block 83 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 88-2 (Dilshan b Afridi 41)</strong> Shahid Afridi strikes with his third ball. It was a typical Afridi delivery, skidding on from a length, and Dilshan dragged on an attempted cut stroke. The ball kept a touch low but that was a poor shot, because the ball was far too close to cut. Afridi strikes a pose in the usual style: legs spread, index fingers pointing to the sky. What a character. He may not be chilled out, but boy is he an entertainer.</p><!-- Block 84 --><p><strong>18th over: Sri Lanka 88-2 (target 278; Sangakkara 5, Jayawardene 0)</strong> I'm not the only one who, after that Tony Greig foot bongo, will not sleep right for a week. \"What the hell was that clip of Greig getting an oily foot massage from a young Sri Lankan girl?\" says Andy Bull. \"Did they show that on your feed? Damn. I spat my Fanta all over my laptop.\"</p><!-- Block 85 --><p><strong>19th over: Sri Lanka 91-2 (target 278; Sangakkara 6, Jayawardene 1)</strong> This, then, is the key partnership of the match, between two of the coolest, classiest batsmen ever to play the game. Afridi brings back Shoaib Akhtar, knowing that one wicket will blow the game open. He has a big shout for LBW against Sangakkara first ball, but it pitched outside leg. Three from the over so, for the first time, the required rate is now above a run a ball. Andy Bull, meanwhile, is still struggling, and I know how he feels. \"If I angle the shower head so that the water is going in through my earhole do you think that will clean out my brain? I need to wash the image of Greig's oleaginous smile as that girl rubbed his toes from my mind as quickly as possible.\" The worst/best bit was the erotic close up of his toes being massaged, and then the sharp cut to Greig, lying horizontally with the aforementioned oleaginous smile.</p><!-- Block 86 --><p><strong>20th over: Sri Lanka 95-2 (target 278; Sangakkara 9, Jayawardene 2)</strong>  Did you see that amazing quicker ball Afridi bowled in New Zealand earlier this winter? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMAzD5kfmWw\">Here it is</a>. He is a mighty handful – he has figures of nine for 42 in the last two World Cups – and, as with Murali earlier in the day, you suspect Sri Lanka would take seeing him off at 3.5 runs per over without any further wickets. Four from Afridi's second over.</p><!-- Block 87 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 95-3 (Jayawardene b Shoaib 2)</strong> Shoaib has done it! He has broken the back of the Sri Lankan innings with a magnificent delivery that shaped in to defile middle stump as Jayawardene walked into the drive. What a piece of bowling! Too fast, too straight, too much. That is fantastic bowling from Shoaib, and fantastic captaincy from Afridi.</p><!-- Block 88 --><p><strong>21st over: Sri Lanka 96-3 (target 278; Sangakkara 7, Samaraweera 1)</strong> Shoaib sends down another beauty that Samaraweera just manages to inside edge to leg before it traps him in front. Marvellous stuff from Shoaib.</p><!-- Block 89 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 96-4 (Samaraweera st K Akmal b Afridi 1)</strong> They might not be cornered, but Pakistan's tigers are savaging Sri Lanka. This is a breathtaking passage of play, and now Afridi has picked up Thilan Samaraweera. It was another wonderful piece of work from Pakistan. Afridi beat the groping Samaraweera outside off with a snorter that turned and bounced and, as Samaraweera's back foot slipped out of the crease, the oft-maligned Kamran Akmal had the bails off in a flash. It went to the the third umpire and replays showed Samaraweera was just out. From absolutely nowhere, Pakistan have clicked to take four wickets for 20. When they are like this, there is no more irresistible force in the sporting world. It's a privilege to watch.</p><!-- Block 90 --><p><strong>22nd over: Sri Lanka 98-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 8, Silva 0)</strong> Afridi has figures of 3-0-7-2. \"Completely agree on the 'Afridi = magnificent entertainer' comment,\" says Thomas Walker. \"I'm trying to introduce cricket to my German girlfriend and already she can't stop talking about 'Boom-Boom'. He makes cricket fun to watch.\" Pakistan as a team make cricket fun to watch. They could breathe joy into anything. Never mind including them in all World Cups. Why stop at sport? They should be a travelling band. Imagine how much fun Afridi would be on Deal or No Deal, or Shoaib Akhtar on the X-Factor panel.</p><!-- Block 91 --><p><strong>23rd over: Sri Lanka 104-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 15, Silva 1)</strong> Sangakkara sets off for a dodgy single, is sent back and would have been in trouble had the throw from cover hit the stumps. It didn't, and he times Shoaib beautifully past backward point for four to bring up the hundred. Sangakkara is the key for Sri Lanka, who need 184 off 27 overs. \"I thought I'd have a quick look at Wales v Italy to try and cleanse that image of Tony Greig from my mind,\" says Clare Davies. \"Imagine my horror at joining at the very point when a man with unfeasibly large thighs was lying on his back changing his shorts. Back to the cricket I reckon.\" I'd still take the rugby player's thighs over the fetishising of Tony Greig's toe.</p><!-- Block 92 --><p><strong>24th over: Sri Lanka 106-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 16, Silva 2)</strong> Two from Afridi's over. \"Is someone going to monitor how many stumpings there are in this tournament?\" asks John Starbuck. \"We seem to have had a lot already, but is this because there's a TV review for nearly all of them, or are the keepers just getting better?\" Hmm, not sure. There seem to be a lot where the back foot <em>just</em> slides out of the crease, rather than the Botham/Hohns method. It does seem that keepers are standing up to the seamers a lot more, which means the occasional dismissal like Ricky Ponting's yesterday.</p><!-- Block 93 --><p><strong>25th over: Sri Lanka 109-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 18, Silva 3)</strong> Shoaib (8-0-27-1) is replaced by the left-arm spinner Abdur Rehman. He will probably have to go for at least 60 if Sri Lanka are to win this game. His first over includes one nasty lifter to Sangakkara and yields just three singles. Sri Lanka need 169 from 25 overs. There's no need to panic yet – the required rate hasn't reached seven, and Sangakkara is still there – but Pakistan are unquestionably on top. \"With insincere apologies to John Starbuck, a little more petrol,\" says Mac Millings. \"Although, of course, they don't say 'petrol' here in the US. When they ask 'Any gas?' I reply, 'Oh, sorry, I meant to do that outside.' Or, 'Bit personal, aren't you? You could just quietly open a window.' Or, 'Yes. And, by the feel of it, also a little follow-through'.' But Millings, we left this riff behind 15 overs ago. You can't do anything right in this tournament, can you? We might have to put you up for OBO adoption.</p><!-- Block 94 --><p><strong>26th over: Sri Lanka 110-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 19, Silva 3)</strong> Afridi whistles through another challenging over – he bowls them so quickly, in more ways than one – at a cost of just one run. His figures are sensational: 5-0-10-2. \"As a cricket fanatic from Pakistan, there's nothing I love more than mentally fragile geniuses,\" says Nadir Hassan. \"So, I'm going to switch over to the tennis and watch Federer stylishly throw away another match against Djokovic.\"</p><!-- Block 95 --><p><strong>27th over: Sri Lanka 112-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 20, Silva 4)</strong> To wild cheers, Chamara Silva has an LBW decision <strong>overturned on review</strong>. He missed a slog sweep at Rehman and was given out LBW by Daryl Harper. The clue's in the words 'Daryl' and 'Harper', and the conviction with which Silva went for the review suggested he might get away with it. I thought he might have been outside the line, but in fact replays showed the delivery was turning past off stump. Two from the over.</p><!-- Block 96 --><p><strong>28th over: Sri Lanka 116-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 21, Silva 6)</strong> Four from Afridi's over, which by his standards today constitutes going round the park. Sri Lanka need 162 from 22 overs.</p><!-- Block 97 --><p><strong>29th over: Sri Lanka 116-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 21, Silva 6)</strong> A maiden from Rehman, who is bowling beautifully. Sri Lanka are on the brink now; they have scored just 12 from the last six overs and the required rate has leapt to 7.71. \"Is it me getting extra smart, or have there really been more than the usual number of bad umpiring decisions in this World Cup?\" says Ali Syedain. \"I have seen more than the usual number of decisions overturned by the referrals.\" The UDRS will always show up minor errors, but in the games I've done there have been few if any shockers. I think that, given the difficulty of the job, the standard of umpiring in international cricket is exceptionally high at the moment. I assume everyone has seen the Harbhajan/Steyn incident but if not, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s93XgGOIyUQ\">you really should</a>.</p><!-- Block 98 --><p><strong>30th over: Sri Lanka 119-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 22, Silva 8)</strong> Umar Gul comes back in place of Afridi. Three from the over. Chamara Silva is playing himself in like it's a Test match and has eight from 34 balls. If you promise by using up so many deliveries, you have to pay. It was something Michael Bevan did so well. He would often by 10 not out off 25 deliveries and then 75 not out off 65. Sri Lanka need 159 from the last 20 overs. \"So Rob, in this match when do you think we'll start suffering the ennui of the Boring Middle Overs?\" says Clare Davies. \"Or is Pakistan the only team that can keep the excitement going for the whole match? I'm thinking that with Shoaib and Afridi, boredom is not really on the menu.\" Like the Carlsberg advert says, Pakistan's bowlers don't do Boring Middle overs, but if they did...</p><!-- Block 99 --><p><strong>31st over: Sri Lanka 128-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 24, Silva 10)</strong> Kamran Akmal misses a stumping chance. Rehman saw Sangakkara coming and beat him down the leg side, but the ball bounced past Akmal's right shoulder and away for five wides. That was a pretty straightforward chance by international standards. A few singles make it Sri Lanka's best over for a while, with none coming from it. \"<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=\"136345073097551\"\">I've seen this TV advert around, oh, 313 times</a> since I've been in India and I still have no idea what it is supposed to mean, or who exactly it is supposed to be advertising, or how exactly Arjuna Ranatunga is qualified to help 'keep cricket clean',\" says Andy Bull. \"But I still enjoy more and more each time I see it. I think it is the way that they have matched each of the players up with their own pairs of sunglasses. You think Supercat looks cool, and then you see Imran come on screen in his Ray Bans. Damn and double damn. Look at that man. He could be auditioning to play Winston Wolf in the Bollywood remake of Pulp Fiction.\" Crikey, that is very cool. And as the video concentrates on the World Cup, I trust they asked Steve Waugh how that go-slow in 1999 helped keep cricket clean.</p><!-- Block 100 --><p><strong>32nd over: Sri Lanka 130-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 25, Silva 11)</strong> This is a match-losing innings from Chamara Silva. He has four more dot balls in that Umar Gul over, which takes him to 11 off 42 deliveries. Eleven off 42!</p><!-- Block 101 --><p><strong>33rd over: Sri Lanka 134-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 28, Silva 13)</strong> Four from Hafeez's over. The Sky commentators, the excellent pair of Tom Moody and Rameez Raja, are suggesting that Sri Lanka should take the Powerplay, and you'd have to agree because they are going to end up taking it when the game has gone. This batting Powerplay is a recurring problem, and I'm surprised more teams don't follow the lead of MS Dhoni and take it in the 34th over.</p><p>\"To keep me going through the boring middle overs (BMO) I've decided to finish off a bottle of red wine (from the Romagna) which, since it had a screw-cap, I let be last night, having got onto spirits for the cricket highlights,\" hics John Starbuck. \"Now, I can get half a bottle into one large glass, as drinking vessels have become so large in the last decade or so. I know this is because restaurants supply them as a way of persuading customers to drink more, and the Jilly's and Oz's added to it because swirling a large glass looks more impressive on TV, but I don't know. It might be better to use smaller glasses because then you have more glasses to look forward to, but the larger glass does look good. Which is best? (If you're stuck for a riff, food &amp; drink usually work, and I'm not sure I could take any more Sainsbury's shopping lists.)\" A bottle of wine should ordinarily supply four glasses, no? And then sometimes you can get five out of it by having small portions for the first three-quarters of the bottle and then one mighty treat at the end.</p><!-- Block 102 --><p><strong>34th over: Sri Lanka 140-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 31, Silva 15)</strong> Sri Lanka have <strong>taken the Powerplay</strong>, so Afridi goes to his death-bowling expert, Umar Gul. Silva takes a desperate single to midwicket and would have been out had Rehman's throw hit the stumps. Sri Lanka take a single from each delivery, but that's not enough. In the last 20 overs, they have scored 68 runs for the loss of four wickets.</p><!-- Block 103 --><p><strong>35th over: Sri Lanka 149-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 37, Silva 16)</strong> Kamran Akmal misses an easy stumping. Again Sangakkara and Rehman were involved; again Rehman saw him coming and speared it down the leg side, but this time the ball bounced off Akmal's iron gloves with Sangakkara miles out of his ground. He compounds Pakistan's frustration by dragging a sweep to fine leg for four off the next delivery. \"Personally, I prefer a pint glass,\" says Phil Dobbin. \"Saves all the messing about...\" <a href=\"http://www.truelad.com/\">True what?</a></p><!-- Block 104 --><p><strong>36th over: Sri Lanka 159-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 44, Silva 18)</strong> Oh, <em>Pakistan</em>. Chamara Silva pulls Gul straight up in the air and Rehman, who was probably still ticking after those two missed stumpings off his bowling, drops an absolute dolly at midwicket. That's a shocker. That took Akmal's error, doubled it, added 47 million, squared it and then put a nice cherry on the top. Moments like that change the mood of a match, and Sangakkara's captures the mood by making room and slicing Gul all the way over third man for six. \"The problem is figuring out what an ordinary glass might be,\" says Ravi Nair. \"With spirits, for instance, government guidelines allege that you can get something silly out of a bottle – 24 or more. Whereas my friend Jim and I, because we use pint glasses, and half-and-half with water, on our monthly or so drink-ups, usually get through a bottle of vodka in four drinks, and the fourth is a bit short... Oh dear.\" You said it. Drinking wine or spirits out should never, ever be done outside a JD Wetherspoons.</p><!-- Block 105 --><p><strong>37th over: Sri Lanka 167-4 (target 278; Sangakkara 47, Silva 22)</strong> Pakistan are starting to lose the plot a little, and the left-arm spinner Rehman bowls a front-foot no-ball. That's unforgivable, and Silva dumps the free hit into the leg side for a couple. Eight from the over. Sri Lanka need 111 from 13 overs.</p><!-- Block 106 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 169-5 (Sangakkara c Shehzad b Afridi 49)</strong> Shahid Afridi has surely won the match for Pakistan! He brought himself back on for the last over of the Powerplay and struck with his fourth ball when Sangakkara swiped a googly to long on, where Shehzad took a nice low catch. It's Afridi's third wicket of the day and his 300th in ODIs. He is the man.</p><!-- Block 107 --><p><strong>38th over: Sri Lanka 169-5 (target 278; Silva 22, Mathews 0)</strong> Afridi's figures are an awesome 7-0-16-3. Earlier in the over he had an LBW appeal against Sangakkara turned down first ball, and went for the review with bizarre haste – almost as quickly as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V9xnMvgO0A\">this umpire raised his finger</a>. The ball pitched well outside leg.  \"Was Rehman's problem that he hadn't considered the possibility that Silva might hit it off the square?\" asks Tom Hopkins. Maybe he just wanted to keep him out in the middle.</p><!-- Block 108 --><p><strong>39th over: Sri Lanka 174-5 (target 278; Silva 25, Mathews 2)</strong> Rehman has a huge shout for caught behind against Mathews turned down, so Pakistan <strong>go for the review</strong>. Kamran Akmal seems certain it's out. That is a very ingenuous review because, as Tony Greig says, a more tactical side would generally save their reviews for LBWs because edges are often so hard to pick up with the available technology. There is nothing to suggest that Mathews edged that – even though he may well have done – so the decision stands and Pakistan are out of reviews. It was a snorter of a delivery from Rehman, spitting nastily after pitching on off stump.</p><!-- Block 109 --><p><strong>40th over: Sri Lanka 178-5 (target 278; Silva 27, Mathews 4)</strong> The non-striker Silva charges down the track and is sent back. Then he slips, but he manages to put himself in the line of Kamran Akmal's throw, which hits him on the body and deflects away from the stumps. Mathews then ends a delicious low-bouncing googly just past leg stump. He has bowled a sensational spell, as a result of which Sri Lanka need precisely <strong>100 from the last 10 overs</strong>.</p><!-- Block 110 --><p><strong>41st over: Sri Lanka 182-5 (target 278; Silva 29, Mathews 6)</strong> Rehman continues to wheel away very effectively. Just singles in that over, and in fact he has conceded only one boundary in his eight overs. Pakistan missed another run-out chance in that over, with Shehzad's throw missing the stumps. Silva would have been the man to go. \"On the review just concluded, on principle it makes sense to review every single decision that Daryl Harper makes,\" says Dominik Hindal. \"However Afridi should have kept in mind that Akmal was probably appealing as this is the first clean take he's made all day.\" In his defence, the stumping of Samaraweera was a superb piece of work.</p><!-- Block 111 --><p><strong>42nd over: Sri Lanka 189-5 (target 278; Silva 30, Mathews 12)</strong>  Mathews had a disgusting mow across the line at Afridi and edges it to third man for four. Afridi's response is a stunning delivery that swerves in and then turns past the outside edge at pace. He is so good. Silva then tries to pull Afridi and ends up throwing his bat towards Daryl Harper at square leg. He hasn't been able to get the ball off the square, but he almost got his bat off it.</p><!-- Block 112 --><p><strong>43rd over: Sri Lanka 203-5 (target 278; Silva 39, Mathews 17)</strong> After 66 balls without a boundary, Silva hits two in two balls, both swept to fine leg off Rehman. <em>The first person who mentions London buses gets it</em>. Mathews completes a superb over for Sri Lanka, 14 from it, with a vicious flat sweep through square leg for four.</p><!-- Block 113 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 209-6 (Mathews c Shehzad b Afridi 22)</strong> Just when things were starting to get a bit hairy for Pakistan, Afridi strikes yet again. Mathews tried to cleave him down the ground for six but picked out Shehzad at long off, who didn't have to move. It's Afridi's fourth wicket, and he strikes his usual pose in celebration.</p><!-- Block 114 --><p><strong>44th over: Sri Lanka 211-6 (target 278; Silva 44, Perera 1)</strong> Afridi has a huge LBW appeal against Perera turned down off his final delivery. I reckon Perera was just outside the line, and of course Pakistan don't have any reviews left. Afridi ends with the wonderful figures of 10-0-34-4. He has given this tournament the kiss of life.</p><!-- Block 115 --><p><strong>45th over: Sri Lanka 223-6 (target 278; Silva 50, Perera 6)</strong> It may be a little late, but Silva is seeing it nicely now and swivel pulls Gul for an emphatic boundary. Then he drives down the ground to reach his fifty from 75 balls, and Perera blitzes a low full toss back whence it came to make it 12 from the over. This isn't over, you know. Sri Lanka need 55 from 30 balls. \"Surely Afridi will get Man of the Match today,\" says Clare Davies. \"He's been absolutely superb with the ball, and his captaining has been pretty faultless. I can only hope that this Pakistan turns up for the next games and breeze into the knockout stages.\" Preach on sister. Younus Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq played immaculate innings, but Afridi has stamped his personality and ability all over this game.</p><!-- Block 116 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 232-7 (Perera b Shoaib Akhtar 8)</strong> Shoaib calms the nerves with a brilliant piece of death bowling, fractionally short of yorker length and too good for Perera as he mows across the line. Sri Lanka need 46 from 25 balls.</p><!-- Block 117 --><p><strong>46th over: Sri Lanka 232-7 (need 46 from 24 balls; Silva 57, Kulasekera 0)</strong> Perera had been dropped the ball before, an awkward but catchable chance to the diving Younus Khan at short fine leg. \"I want to say how much I'm enjoying the Cricket World Cup so far,' says Sam Hedges. \"I don't care that it takes ages, as long as the matches are exciting/intriguing.  Loving the commentary too… you get to hear some of the lesser well known TMS members and also in-country experts who don't necessarily get an airing during England games.  Really interesting to hear a different way of thinking.\" Yeah, this is a very good point. Tom Moody has been particularly good on Sky. It's also nice to hear the interaction between the new pairs. It's like a swingers party for commentators, or something.</p><!-- Block 118 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 233-8 (Silva st K Akmal b Rehman 57)</strong> It's all over now, and finally Rehman gets somebody stumped off a wide. He saw Silva coming and slipped it well wide of off stump. The fact that it was a right-hander meant Kamran Akmal had a decent view of the ball, and he completed the stumping. Silva played an odd, two-paced innings: 30 from the first 66 balls and 27 from the last 12.</p><!-- Block 119 --><p><strong>47th over: Sri Lanka 242-8 (need 36 from 18 balls; Kulasekera 7, Herath 1)</strong> Herath survives two shouts from the same ball, first for LBW and then for a run out as he scampered for a leg bye. Daryl Harper went upstairs to make sure and Herath was just home. Kulasekera steers four to third man, and Rehman finishes with figures of 10-1-63-1. He deserved better.</p><!-- Block 120 --><p><strong>48th over: Sri Lanka 249-8 (need 29 from 12 balls; Kulasekera 12, Herath 2)</strong> A fine, boundaryless last over from Shoaib yields just seven. He has been excellent and finished with 10-0-42-2.</p><!-- Block 121 --><p><strong>49th over: Sri Lanka 260-8 (need 18 from 6 balls; Kulasekera 20, Herath 4)</strong> Mohammad Hafeez's first five balls go for a single, and then Kulasekera hoicks a full toss for a big six to keep the game just about alive. Sri Lanka will need 18 from the last over. Earlier in the over Hafeez dropped a stinging return chance when Kulasekera smeared a low full toss straight back at him, and also had a big LBW shout against Herath turned down. He might just have been outside the line.</p><!-- Block 122 --><p><strong>49.1 overs: Sri Lanka 260-8 (need 18 from 5 balls; Kulasekera 20, Herath 3)</strong> The last over will be bowled by Umar Gul. Sri Lanka have to get Kulasekera on strike. Herath swings and misses at the first ball. Why didn't they risk running through for a bye?</p><!-- Block 123 --><p><strong>49.2 overs: Sri Lanka 260-8 (need 17 from 4 balls; Kulasekera 20, Herath 4)</strong> Herath drags a single to short fine leg.</p><!-- Block 124 --><p><strong>49.3 overs: Sri Lanka 260-8 (need 13 from 3 balls; Kulasekera 24, Herath 4)</strong> Kulasekera edges a boundary to third man!</p><!-- Block 125 --><p><strong>49.4 overs: Sri Lanka 260-8 (need 13 from 2 balls; Kulasekera 24, Herath 4)</strong> Umar Gul is so lucky there! He speared it down the leg side, but between the legs of Kulasekera, and Kamran Akmal did pretty well to stop it going to the boundary.</p><!-- Block 126 --><p><strong>WICKET! 49.5 overs: Sri Lanka 265-9 (Kulasekera c U Akmal b Gul 24)</strong> Kulasekera clubs a low full toss to long on, and Pakistan have finally put this match to bed.</p><!-- Block 127 --><p><strong>50 overs: Sri Lanka 266-9 (Herath 4, Muralitharan 0); PAKISTAN WIN BY 11 RUNS</strong> That's the end of a fine match, deservedly won by Pakistan. They were their usual mix of the sublime and the utterly preposterous, but when they were good they were spectacular. Shahid Afridi took four wickets to make it nine in two games, and captained with inspirational enthusiasm. That was such an enjoyable game, the best of the tournament so far by a mile.

looks chaotic: but don't be afraid","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-13T00:06:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2011/feb/13/twitter-looks-chaotic-dont-be-afraid","fields":{"body":"<p>Imagine a jumble sale just after a gaggle of pensioners have steamed through it. It's a haphazard pile of clashing colours and styles, heaps of dross tangled up with the odd gem. Yet if you let your eye adjust to the chaos, and then rummage, it's surprising what turns up.</p><p>That, more or less, is what Twitter is like. Its charm lies not in whizzy new technology – or, as a confirmed luddite, I'd have given up ages ago – but in the constant churn of ideas, jokes, gossip, and discoveries. So the first thing I learned about Twitter is not to be afraid of it, just because it sounds geeky and looks&nbsp;chaotic.</p><p>The second lesson was not to be seduced by the flashily obvious, but to burrow down to the juicy stuff. I tend not to follow the – mostly predictable – updates from the big fish of politics or showbiz, but the far more rewarding minnows: academics and scientists, obscure backbenchers and foreign bloggers, happy anoraks with a lifetime's lovingly stored knowledge of anything from Californian primary voting trends to making marmalade.</p><p>Things I'd never have known without Twitter last week range from the hidden significance of sculleries (via a tweeted link to a beautifully written architecture blog) to the fact that Chinese schools, far from benefiting from zealous \"tiger mothering\", are now consulting British teachers on how to reintroduce creativity to their hothoused children. It's where I appeal for anything from new film recommendations to help fixing the printer: the wisdom of crowds may be hopeless for devising public policy, as David Cameron discovered, but it's very good for locating a discontinued shade of lipstick.</p><p>Breaking news often comes to me first from Twitter: it's where I first heard about the protests in Tunisia. But it's also where I went to find demographers and development economists and Arab historians with insights into the deeper causes of the Middle East uprising. Twitter can look broad and shallow – all vacuous idiots broadcasting what they had for breakfast – but if used selectively it's actually suited to going narrow and deep.</p><p>But Twitter isn't just an ivory tower: it has added a new, more open layer to political debate. Watching users react in real time to the three party leaders' televised debates turned the site for me into one huge focus group, illuminating a public mood that had previously felt difficult to grasp. It's taught me a necessary lesson about the gulf between what jaded hacks think and what the voting public does.</p><p>But the most important lesson I've drawn from it is that the desire for intelligent debate in public space isn't lost. Just as jumble sales only work if people bring as well as buy, Twitter is all about the exchange of arguments and remaining open to new perspectives.</p><p>It's changed my views on everything from police reform (following Greater Manchester Police's marathon tweeting of every 999 call received in one day, much of it astonishingly banal) to sleep (via some revealing statistics on how much of the latter parents actually get). Perhaps the most rewarding thing Twitter has taught me is how much there still is to learn.</p><h2>What Twitter means to me</h2><p><strong>Ian Rankin </strong><em>(@Beathhigh)</em></p><p>I work from home and work on my own. Twitter connects me to the outside world, and makes it feel as though I'm in a huge, airy office full of funny, well-informed people. It gives me&nbsp;instant news, clever jokes, views, and reactions. Fans of my books can contact me, and I can let them know what I'm up to.</p><p>Twitter is also my diary. I can scroll back through my tweets and recall what I was up to on any particular day. I keep in touch with friends, make new ones, renew old acquaintances, and sometimes am even gifted ideas for stories. All from my office chair, in 140 characters (which also makes it a fantastic daily exercise in editing and concision).</p><p><em>Ian Rankin is an author and the creator of the Rebus crime novels  </em></p><p><strong>Tracey Thorn </strong><em>(@tracey_thorn) </em></p><p>Twitter is where I go for&nbsp;jokes and sympathy. It's hard to be humorous in song lyrics. When you write a song, you want it to be listened to over and over again, and funny lyrics very soon become extremely irritating. So Twitter is an outlet for the frivolous, the irreverent, the throwaway comment. It's also a good place to share arcane bits of information.</p><p>It's not so good for expressing serious opinions. Twitter is at its most annoying when everyone gets up on their high horse about something. But it appeals to the economist in me. It imposes rules and sets limits, which I like. Use fewer words. Use shorter words. Get to the point. And try to be funny.</p><p><em>Tracey Thorn is one half of the band Everything But the Girl </em></p><p><strong>Jemima Khan</strong><em> (@JemimaGoldsmith) </em></p><p>I dipped a toe in. It seemed like a place that gave monomaniacs a tannoy: so little space to say so little, Facebook for an older wastrel. I loitered, tweetless. I acquired 15 patient followers. I felt forced onto the stage with a mic and no speech.</p><p>That was a year ago. Now, I'm a promiscuous twitterer. I use Twitter for up-to-the minute news, for aphorisms, jokes and links to obscure and interesting articles. I use it for charity as well as inanity. I use it to reply to Glenda Slaggs. I use it as a very resourceful directory. I use it as a friend to whom I can say \"that's bollocks\" when there's no one else around. Twitter never sleeps. It has revolutionised the way I procrastinate.</p><p><em>Jemima Khan is a writer and campaigner</em></p><p><strong>Victoria Coren </strong><em>(@VictoriaCoren)</em></p><p>I use Twitter in its most basic function: as an antidote to loneliness. I don't think you're supposed to admit that, if you're on TV sometimes and have a lot of followers. But if I claimed I use it purely to promote my work, or practise the art of the polished one-line joke, I'd be lying. I use it just as the most cynical anti-Twitter ranter imagines: to see who's eating toast or who's got a cold, and to feel part of a community. No shame in that. It's fun. If you fancy watching an election debate with 20,000 people, doing it this way saves a lot of trips to Tesco. The connections are brief but real. They're a bonus to life, not an alternative. We're all passing through this valley; why not smile at fellow travellers on the way?</p><p><em>Victoria Coren is an author, poker player and Observer columnist </em></p><p><strong>Ory Okolloh </strong><em>(@kenyanpundit)</em></p><p>I don't have time to catch up on the various blogs, newspapers, TV stations, etc that I'd like to track, so I use Twitter quite a bit as a news curator of sorts – and love the way I can regularly stumble on something I ordinarily wouldn't. I also find it a good source of \"cocktail hour\" material that makes me sound smarter than I am. A surprise use: I have found it to be a fantastic way to network and make connections in person, especially when I travel. I tweet in the same way I used to blog: sharing thoughts mainly about Kenya, Africa and tech. Finally, I confess I use it a lot to procrastinate and escape my always overwhelming inbox.</p><p><em>Ory Okolloh is Google's Africa policy manager, and the co-founder of crisis-mapping site Ushahidi.com and political site Mzalendo.com </em></p><p>• This article was amended on 13 February 2011 to correct the number of twitter users watching the election debate.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/2/12/1297524399112/Twitter-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/13/twitter-looks-chaotic-dont-be-afraid","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2011/feb/13/twitter-looks-chaotic-dont-be-afraid","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"World carbon dioxide emissions data by country: China speeds ahead of the rest","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-31T07:30:00Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2","fields":{"body":"<p>World carbon dioxide emissions are one way of measuring a country's economic growth too.</p><p>And the latest figures - published by the respected <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8\">Energy Information Administration</a> - show CO2 emissions from energy consumption - the vast majority of Carbon Dioxide produced.</p><p>A reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions is not only the goal of environmentalists but also of pretty much every government in the world. <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/essential_background/kyoto_protocol/items/1678.php\">Currently 192 countries have adopted the Kyoto protocol</a>. One fo the aims is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% of the 1990 levels by 2012 collectively for<a href=\"http://unfccc.int/essential_background/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/items/5524.php\">countries starred on this list</a>.</p><p>The map, above (<a href=\" http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2011/02/10/CarbonWeb.pdf\">you can get it as a PDF file here</a>) is produced by Guardian graphic artists <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/markmccormick\">Mark McCormick</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paulscruton\">Paul Scruton</a>. It shows a world where established economies have large - but declining - carbon emissions. While the new economic giants are growing rapidly. This newly-released data is from 2009 - the latest available.</p><p>On pure emissions alone, the key points are:</p><blockquote><p>• China emits more CO2 than the US and Canada put together - up by 171% since the year 2000<br />• The US has had declining CO2 for two years running, the last time the US had declining CO2 for 3 years running was in the 1980s<br />• The UK is down one place to tenth on the list, 8% on the year. The country is now behind Iran, South Korea, Japan and Germany<br />• India is now the world's third biggest emitter of CO2 - pushing Russia into fourth place<br />• The biggest decrease from 2008-2009 is Ukraine - down 28%. The biggest increase is the Cook Islands - up 66.7%</p></blockquote><p><strong></strong></p><p>But that is only one way to look at the data - and it doesn't take account of how many people live in each country. If you look at per capita emissions, a different picture emerges where:</p><blockquote><p>• Some of the world's smallest countries and islands emit the most per person - the highest being Gibraltar with 152 tonnes per person<br />• The US is still number one in terms of per capita emissions among the big economies - with 18 tonnes emitted per person<br />• China, by contrast, emits under six tonnes per person, India only 1.38<br />• For comparison, the whole world emits 4.49 tonnes per person</p></blockquote><p>There are other sources of emissions data too, if you want to compare - albeit not as up-to-date:</p><blockquote><p>• The <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/ghg_data/ghg_data_unfccc/items/4146.php\">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</a> gathers the data on world carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This is only available up to 2008.<br />• the International Energy Agency (IEA) has <a href=\"http://www.iea.org/co2highlights/\">global carbon emissions data up to 2008</a></p></blockquote><p>But what can we say about this data and how close we are to the collective targets in the Kyoto agreement?</p><p>The Kyoto protocol target emission does not include, but this EIA data does. You can't tell this from the <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/docs/IPMNotes.html#ind\">notes on the data</a>, but the EIA confirmed to us this was the case.</p><p>We can determine what the so called 'bunker fuels' are from the <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=5&amp;pid=66&amp;aid=13\">data here</a>.</p><p>But only looking at carbon dioxide emissions doesn't give us the total for all greenhouse gases.</p><p>So we'll have to wait until the UNFCCC publishes the results of global greenhouse gasses collated data before we can draw any firm conclusions about meeting the Kyoto agreements.</p><p>The <a href=\"#data\">full data is below, going right back to 1980</a>.

world will grow by 25% in the next two decades, according to <a href=\"http://pewforum.org/The-Future-of-the-Global-Muslim-Population.aspx\">new research by the US-based Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life</a>.</p><p>This is the second time that Pew have studied global Muslim populations before - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/oct/08/muslim-population-islam-religion\">we wrote about it last year</a>.</p><p>The data is very detailed - it shows population by country, and

interactive visualisation of there own here too.<br /></a></p><p>The key findings of the Pew research are:</p><blockquote><p>• If current trends continue, Muslims will make up 26.4% of the world's total projected population of 8.3bn in 2030, up from 23.4% of the estimated 2010 world population of 6.9bn<br />• From 1990 to 2010, the global Muslim population increased at an average annual rate of 2.2%, compared with the projected rate of 1.5% for the period from 2010 to 2030<br />• 79 countries will have a million or more Muslim inhabitants in 2030, up from 72 countries today<br />• In the US the population projections show the number of Muslims more than doubling over the next two decades, rising from 2.6m in 2010 to 6.2m in 2030<br />• In Europe, the Muslim share of the population is expected to grow by nearly one-third over the next 20 years, rising from 6% of the region's inhabitants in 2010 to 8% in 2030<br />• The UK's Muslim population is set to rise from 2.9m now to 5.6m in 2030 - up from 2% of the UK population to 4.6%</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"#data\">The full data is below</a>.
