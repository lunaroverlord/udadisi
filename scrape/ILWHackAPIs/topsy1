Some come on foot. Others with their few possessions piled on to rented trucks. Their destination is the camps at Kakuma. Set in the flat, barren plains of north-western Kenya, this is an unlikely location for refugee camps. Yet families from as far afield as Darfur in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia arrive here.<br /></p> <p>“They come to Kakuma because it is secure – life can get better for them,” says Dominic Gachanja of the Lutheran World Federation, which administers the camps. “They have grown into a small town,” he adds. The camps house 170,000 refugees, most of them fleeing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/15/south-sudan-first-anniversary-civil-war\">fighting in South Sudan</a>.<br /></p> <p>Kakuma is in Turkana county – one of the poorest and driest parts of Kenya where it is blisteringly hot. Providing water for the growing refugee population has been a struggle, until now. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/11/kenya-water-discovery-drought-relief\">discovery of vast underground sources of water</a>, announced in September 2013, has transformed the lives of these people. Since then, seven boreholes have been dug.</p> <p>“All have been yielding, or high-yielding,” says Gachanja. Some produce as much as 60 cubic metres of water an hour, and a new well providing 110 cubic metres is about to come into operation. “Before, water was scarce; now there is enough.”</p> <p>The Lutherans were provided with a satellite-based mapping technology developed by a French company, <a href=\"http://www.rtiexploration.com/\">Radar Technologies International</a> (RTI). This uses ground-penetrating radar to locate water in aquifers. Twenty-eight aid workers were trained to use the laptop, GPS system and maps that indicate where the best prospects for drilling are.</p> <p>The transformation has been remarkable. “In 2011, before we had this technology, we drilled 10 boreholes,” Gachanja says. “Six were dry, and the best well provided just 25 cubic metres of water an hour.”</p> <p>Life at Kakuma is hard. Last November the World Food Programme – running short of funds – <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/search?page=search&amp;docid=54aff3a99&amp;query=kakuma\">halved rations for the refugees</a>. Many people could only afford to eat once a day, while others had to beg. However, international donors responded to WFP appeals and the rations have now been restored to their previous levels.</p> <p>But at least there is sufficient water. It has meant families have enough for their own needs, and gardens have sprung up around their homes. Vegetables are grown for sale and refugees can keep chickens to feed their families. The town of Lodwar and the nearby village of Napuu have also benefited, according to a follow-up study conducted by RTI. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9d6b5675-5a72-4ebb-92fe-adb2cbd153fd\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421243166454/a3652693-22a5-43be-a839-6a75b069f8e8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"MDG : Turkana Aquifer : pastoralists migrating to Lotikipi in search of pasture and water\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkana pastoralists migrate to the Turkana aquifer at Lotikipi in search of pasture and water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RTI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One giant aquifer, fed from the mountains in neighbouring Ethiopia, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2013/sep/11/1\">estimated to be recharged at an annual rate of 3.4 billion cubic metres</a>, nearly three times the water use of New York City. When the find was made, the government, supported by Unesco, announced that <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/strategic_groundwater_reserves_found_in_northern_kenya/#.VLUSbqb7d7l\">a nationwide groundwater mapping programme would be launched</a>, to locate similar aquifers in the country. The most arid counties would be targeted first, to relieve the acute scarcity of water that many people face.</p> <p>Since then the programme has gone strangely quiet. According to Abou Amani of Unesco, planning has been under way behind the scenes. A budget is in place, of 1.5bn Kenyan shillings (£10.9m). “We are looking for funding from the stakeholders,” says Amani.</p> <p>Chrispin Juma, the interim director of water resources in the Kenyan government, confirmed that planning was under way, but said the plans were “restricted” and referred inquiries to the ministry.</p> <p>Getting a clear indication of just why the search for water appears to have been put on hold, when so many Kenyans face scarcity, is difficult to fathom. No one doubts that the giant aquifers in Turkana exist, nor that others could be found if similar surveys are conducted.</p> <p>Professor Norbert Akech Opiyo, of the University of Nairobi, attended a <a href=\"http://www.mku.ac.ke/index.php/mku-latest-news/295-lodwar-to-host-international-water-summit\">water summit in Turkana</a> late last year. “We are all perplexed by the lack of progress,” he said. “People are still doing further studies, although the finds have been proven.”</p> <p>He thinks the reorganisation of government brought about by the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11106558\">introduction of a new Kenyan constitution</a> in 2010 has left considerable uncertainty. “Nobody is quite sure who does what.”</p> <p>Others have more conspiratorial explanations for the inertia, ranging from government budgets being misspent to the suggestion that key officials have little concern for the plight of poor people in remote, rural communities, far from the capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1d375b40-a60f-4ba4-8c70-445d834c6ff0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421243447588/80b82b10-9c77-4f1c-b23c-9b7252c8a3fe-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"MDG : Turkana Aquifer : \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local herders lead livestock to the Napuu water trough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RTI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The environmental and wildlife campaigner Dr Paula Kahumbu believes that, in time, the discoveries will transform Kenyans’ perception of their country. “We see ourselves as water-poor, but this is not the case.”</p> <p>She believes that Turkana could be a net food exporter, if the underground aquifers are properly exploited. Wildlife could also benefit. “Now there is competition between wild animals and domestic livestock. If we could generate revenue from our water we could set aside larger areas for wildlife,” she says.</p> <p>Kahumbu accepts that the new constitution has increased uncertainty, and that there is a need for a new community land act, which will define just who owns the water beneath their soil. “But this is such a huge opportunity. It shouldn’t be on the back burner – we should have seen a faster rollout.”</p> <p>• Correction: In a previous version we stated that people in Kakuma had been reduced to one meal a day after rations had been halved in November. In fact rations were restored to their full previous levels in January.<br /></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/15/kenya-water-turkana-aquifer-kakuma","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/15/kenya-water-turkana-aquifer-kakuma","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Kenya's tech entrepreneurs shun Konza 'silicon savannah'","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-05T14:23:05Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah","fields":{"body":"<p>Kenya’s plan to catapult itself into an elite club of technology hubs by splashing out $14.5bn (£9.3bn) on a city dubbed a “silicon savannah” will not solve fundamental financing problems facing the country’s burgeoning tech industry, say people working in the sector.</p> <p>Leading figures say <a href=\"http://www.konzacity.go.ke/\">Konza Techno City</a>, which the Kenyan government plans to complete by 2019, will fail to attract top talent because <a href=\"http://community.ihub.co.ke/blogs/10624\">it is too far [37 miles] from Nairobi</a>. Funds allocated for Konza would be better spent giving commercial lenders incentives to invest in new startups, they say.</p> <p>Chris Asego, co-founder of Eneza Education, an SMS-based teaching service, says he supports the idea of Konza, noting it could spawn innovation if planned and built well. But he is acutely aware of the need to spur more investors to put money into companies like his.</p> <p>“Our company doesn’t have a single Kenyan investor,” he said, adding that they had one African investor so far but were keen to find more local funding. “You realise when you go to Nairobi that most of the technological hubs are in one location – we have <a href=\"http://www.ihub.co.ke/\">iHub</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.nailab.co.ke/\">Nailab</a>, the <a href=\"http://mlab.co.ke/\">m:lab</a>, then you drive 100 metres from that building and you get other labs close by. Most of these hubs are supported by people who are not even Kenyans.”<br /></p> <p>Kenya’s information and communication technology (ICT) sector <a href=\"http://www.humanipo.com/news/46203/ict-contribution-to-kenyas-gdp-now-at-12-1/\">contributed about 12% to gross domestic product last year</a>, showing steady growth from 2006 when it made up 9% of the economy. The Konza Technopolis Development Authority (KTDA) says that by 2020 the city will create 100,000 jobs and bring in $1bn a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Konza city\">  <iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/58618218\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>But east Africa’s booming tech sector, which is anchored in Nairobi, would benefit more from private-sector partnerships and better ICT training and education programmes, says Josiah Mugambi, executive director of iHub. “I support the idea behind [Konza city], but I’m just not sure that it’s what’s needed right now. Many [in Kenya’s tech community] are sceptical about [Konza city]. Density is important but growing those companies that would eventually fill – or better still, would be able to build – such a city I think is more critical.”</p> <p>Kenya’s national development plan, known as Vision 2030, includes <a href=\"http://www.vision2030.go.ke/index.php/pillars/project/Economic/227\">a target to transform Konza into a bustling city</a> with 200,000 people working in business outsourcing in the next 20 years, with the larger goal of becoming a world class destination for tech business, education and research. </p> <p>“Konza will serve as a hub for the east African technology industries, attracting leaders from the region and beyond. Konza is not meant to compete for Nairobi business, but will complement growth. This is similar to many countries globally where there are satellite cities to decongest the capital cities,” says Catherine Adeya-Weya, chief executive of KTDA.</p> <p></p> <p>But not all Kenyan tech entrepreneurs think Konza is a bad move. Ken Mwenda, managing director at <a href=\"http://www.emobilis.ac.ke/\">eMobilis Mobile Technology Academy</a>, says: “You need to start somewhere and [Konza] is that somewhere. There have been many other disjointed government efforts and initiatives but the scale of this project means that one would have to try hard not to notice that Kenya is seriously committed to its tech industry.”</p> <p>Kenya, which has long been seen as a leader in mobile technology, has 32.2m mobile subscribers giving it a 79.2% mobile penetration rate, according to <a href=\"http://ca.go.ke/images/downloads/STATISTICS/Q4SectorStatisticsReport2014-2013FINAL.pdf\">the most recent quarterly report</a> (pdf) from Kenya’s communications authority. Many of the country’s projects focus on developing products that reach Kenya’s poorest through SMS services available on basic mobile phones.</p> <p><a href=\"http://tpjackson.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/konza-step-too-far/\">Kenya-based journalist Tom Jackson says in a blog post</a>: “There are concerns that Kenya might be getting ahead of itself in building Konza before its ICT capabilities are up to scratch. Konza may be a brave attempt at revolutionising the sector, but many feel that it should not be the first step on the road to a booming tech sector. Local interest in investment in Konza was low.”</p> <p>But multilateral organisations such as the World Bank are keen to pump funding into developing countries’ tech sectors, with Kenya touted as a model for others to follow. Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etq45ovrJEw\">said</a>: “What we’re seeing in Kenya is what we need to see in every part of the developing world. We also need to find ways of building business environments that will allow the development of small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs, and we know that jobs are really the way that we’re going to end poverty.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 15 January to clarify that while Enza Education is looking for more local investment, it does support Konza Techno City.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/05/kenya-technology-entrepreneurs-konza-silicon-savannah","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Fintech: financial technology startups to watch","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-02T06:00:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/fintech-startups-sustainable-financial-technology","fields":{"body":"<p>The world of financial technology (or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/may/13/fintech-financial-technology-startups\" title=\"\">fintech</a>) is hot. Growing faster than almost any other segment of the tech industry, global investment in the sector <a href=\"http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/global-fin-tech-investment-accenture\" title=\"\">reached nearly $3bn last year</a>. As well as bumper profits for investors, fintech innovations hold out hope for major social returns too. We look at innovative ideas in areas where opportunity for impact is ripe.</p><h2>Banking the unbanked</h2><p>Africa is home to the largest unbanked population on the planet. Four in five adult Africans do not use formal banking services. In Ethiopia, the rate is even lower, with as many as 90% of people unbanked.</p><p>Addis Ababa-based financial technology firm <a href=\"http://kifiya.com/\" title=\"\">Kifiya</a> is working to change that. Established in 2010, the start-up has worked with the government to set up a unified billing system called Lehulu. The system automatically collates electricity, water and landline phone charges into one single bill. Householders in Addis Ababa can pay their primary utility bills altogether in one of 31 centres that Kifiya operates across the capital city.</p><p>Kifiya also offers a branchless banking service enabling unbanked customers to conduct basic transactions. The system, which is accessed via a registered card or biometric data, relies on itinerant agents visiting communities with a specially tailored internet-enabled hardware device. A Little World's <a href=\"http://www.alittleworld.com/htmls/zero/platform.html\" title=\"\">Zero platform</a> and <a href=\"http://www.finopaytech.com/\" title=\"\">FINO PayTech</a> offer similar branchless banking services in rural India.</p><h2>Mobile payments</h2><p>Mobile phone-based paying is where a lot of the action is at these days. Mobile phone ownership is high in countries such as Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania, where Vodafone's national subsidiaries operate the hugely successful <a href=\"http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/about/about-us/money_transfer.html\" title=\"\">M-Pesa mobile payments service</a>. <a href=\"http://www.wizzit.co.za/\" title=\"\">Wizzit</a> in South Africa and <a href=\"http://www.globe.com.ph/gcash\" title=\"\">GCash</a> in the Philippines demonstrate how fast the mobile money market is developing.</p><p>Mobile payments are sparking associated innovations too. Take the <a href=\"http://m-ledger.com/\" title=\"\">M-ledger app</a>, for example. The brainchild of two amateur programmers from Kenya, the app scans SMS messages sent by M-Pesa to confirm transfers and then collates these on an onscreen dashboard. The service enables M-Pesa users to manage their payments more fully, checking them by date, amount and recipient.</p><p>Payment problems aren't just a developing world phenomenon, 23% of US transactions by value are made in cash. Some use cash because of concerns about digital security and online fraud. Others simply can't afford the charges associated with banks and credit cards. Alternatively, they may well lack the documentation or credit history necessary to open a bank account.</p><p>California-based <a href=\"http://www.paynearme.com/en\" title=\"\">PayNearMe</a> enables consumers to pay their rent remotely, make purchases online and make other transactions that have typically become electronic. Equipped with a PayNearMe Card or PaySlip, cash users simply need to enter one of the 17,000 participating 7-Eleven, Family Dollar and ACE Cash Express stores and make their payment.</p><p>Using a proprietary embedded barcode technology, the cash is transferred automatically to the biller's account. The approach avoids the need for costly and complex money orders, as well as reducing the labour costs and fraud risks associated with collecting cash on-site.</p><h2>Disability and financial services</h2><p>Lack of banking infrastructure prevents many from accessing banking services, but it's not the only barrier. Disability can act as an obstacle to financial inclusion too.</p><p>Blindness is the most obvious case in point. Blind or partially sighted customers face difficulties reading the screens on cash machines. Back in 2012, UK bank Barclays responded by equipping more than 3,500 of its ATMs with <a href=\"https://www.yourbank.barclays.co.uk/t5/Your-ideas-brought-to-life/Audio-cash-machines-Now-we-re-talking/ba-p/8\" title=\"\">audio instructions</a>, which individuals with sight difficulties can listen to via a set of headphones. The bank also issues high visibility bankcards to facilitate their use at ATMs and with chip and pin devices.</p><p>In rural regions of India, the barriers are more educational than physical. Many are either entirely illiterate or unable to read Hindi or English, the country's primary administrative languages. Chennai-based <a href=\"http://www.vortexindia.co.in/\" title=\"\">Vortex Engineering</a> has designed an ATM that seeks to overcome these problems by using fingerprint authentication and multi-language screens in regional languages. The system is widely used by the State Bank of India.</p><p>To increase its suitability to rural conditions even further, Vortex's Gramteller Duo cashpoint is also designed to be energy efficient (requiring less than 100 watts) and heat tolerant (operating in temperature up to 50C). Vortex has a second design – the Ecoteller – that can be powered by solar energy.</p><h2>Aggregating aids</h2><p>Online trading platforms have made us all (potential) stockbrokers now. That said, we still need to do the laborious work of identifying the right stocks to buy. For sustainability-minded private investors, the challenge is more taxing still as the relevant data is often hard to find or tricky to decipher.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.motifinvesting.com/\" title=\"\">Motif Investing</a> runs a low-cost trading platform that promises to take the hassle out of stock selection. The California firm has compiled over 100 ready-made, professionally built portfolios (or 'motifs) linked around specific themes or ideas.</p><p>Most are fairly conventional. If you want to know what stocks will benefit from trends in private equity or the boom in online gaming then Motif offers a list to pick from. But sustainability gets a look in too. Among the options on offer are portfolios linked around the smart grid, water shortage, 'fossil free' and income inequality. The latest monthly return on Motif's <a href=\"https://www.motifinvesting.com/motifs/socially-responsible#/overview\" title=\"\">socially responsible</a> portfolio is 4.3% - half a percentage point above the company's <a href=\"https://www.motifinvesting.com/motifs/seven-deadly-sins#/overview\" title=\"\">Seven Deadly Sins</a> selection.</p><p>Technology is helping pool donor cash, not just investor finance. <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/yimby\" title=\"\">Yimby</a> provides an illustrative example. The brainchild of UK employee-giving advocate JustGiving, the service provides a platform for communities to crowdfund for local projects. Over 700 projects have so far been funded through Yimby, which charges a 5% fee for successful projects.</p><p><em>The finance hub is funded by EY.

The smart slum is still a peripheral idea, but we can speculate on the likely impact of <a href=\"http://www.ovum.com/slums-must-form-part-of-the-smart-city-movement/\">extending this ‘smartness’</a> to slums and make two competing claims. Firstly, that development professionals should be wary of smart slums repeating some of the negative impacts of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development\">ICT4D</a>; and secondly, that a push for smart slums could be appropriated for social justice.</p> <p>The idea of the smart city is a vision of a networked urbanism. The promise is that environmental monitoring and feedback from <a href=\"http://www.libelium.com/top_50_iot_sensor_applications_ranking/#show_infographic\">embedded sensors</a> everywhere will simultaneously deliver greener and more productive cities. The idea has been most fully materialised in brand new cities like <a href=\"http://www.songdo.com/songdo-international-business-district/the-city/master-plan.aspx\">Songdo</a> in South Korea but is <a href=\"http://www.connectedurbandevelopment.org/\">spreading to established urban centres</a> like San Francisco, Amsterdam and Madrid.</p> <p>The smart city itself is by no means a new idea. In previous decades it had labels like cybernetic or connected city, but it has been given a new lease of life by the flowering of small, cheap and adaptable sensors that draw on smartphone technologies and DIY electronics (think <a href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/\">Arduino</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theinternetofthings.eu/\">Internet of Things</a>). For people working in development this comes with an attractive new feature; the smart city of today is seen as participatory. Feedback and monitoring includes the active participation of citizens who install smart metrics and sensors (such as the Arduino-based <a href=\"http://www.smartcitizen.me/pages/sck\">Smart Citizen Kit</a>, which measures temperature, humidity, noise, CO2 and NO2 levels), contribute data, and become part of a kind of sensor citizenship. The smart slum also makes sense as a way to bridge the infrastructure gap; by adding programmable intelligence to services that are extended in to slums (such as sensors that <a href=\"http://www.libelium.com/smart_water_wsn_pipe_leakages/\">report the water flow in pipes</a> and send alerts if water use is outside of the expected normal range), they can be managed in a way that is responsive and well-adapted to the ever-shifting environments of informal settlements. <br /></p> <p>The idea of smart slums shares a great deal with the way slum mapping has adopted new technologies and participatory processes. A decade or so ago, a coalition of NGOs and women’s networks <a href=\"http://eau.sagepub.com/content/14/2/225.short\">mapped hundreds of Pune’s slum settlements</a>, with the aim of bringing poor communities into the official mechanisms of city planning, so that they would get a better share of resources. More recently, the <a href=\"http://www.mapkibera.org/\">Map Kibera</a> project has used the participatory technologies of GPS and <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.500/-0.100\">OpenStreetMap</a> to enable residents of Kenya’s biggest slum to make a digital map of their streets and alleyways. Map Kibera is meant as a platform for empowerment; giving residents a way to monitor and report on their own experiences of government initiatives. <br /></p> <p>But smart slums could still repeat the <a href=\"http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/25561/\">problematic cycle of first generation ICT4D</a> if the technologies are dropped into communities without an effort to build the capacity of poorer citizens to use them. Many funding evaluation reports and academic studies show how ineffective the tech-led approach can be, and how it <a href=\"http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1107/1027\">can reinforce existing divides</a>. Moreover, the whole idea of monitoring, like mapping, should be approached with caution. Mapping and measurement were the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYL4pVUW7Lg\">original mechanisms of colonial control</a> and projects that simply add visibility without agency risk reinforcing the status quo. It may also be that sensors and smartness paradoxically limit citizenship rather than extending it, if citizens just participate by generating data and real resource decisions are made elsewhere. This is a dystopian version of smart slums as a way to subdue and control. <br /></p> <p>So how could smart slums be done differently? One approach is being tested through bottom-up citizen science. The approach of these projects (like our own <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CitSciKS\">Kosovo Science for Change</a>) draws on critical pedagogies like that of 1960s educator <a href=\"http://www.freire.org/paulo-freire/\">Paulo Freire</a>, for whom learning was the co-operative activity of understanding how our lived experience is constructed, and how to make a difference in the world. These projects involve citizens in using embedded sensor technology to answer their own questions about their environments. The approach would be familiar to development professionals as participatory community development but with added elements of <a href=\"http://www.raisinggeeks.com/blog/maker-movement/\">maker culture</a> – fablabs and hackerspaces – and empirical methods. <br /></p> <p>If applied in the context of smart slums, these methods could be part<br />of a new politics of infrastructure. As every part of traffic, water,<br />energy and waste systems become direct generators of data they raise new questions of governance. Now that we can see what’s going on and have the computational ability to influence it, who gets to decide how it’s<br />managed?

Exploiting ethnic and political tensions, it and its affiliates have stepped up recruitment along the Kenyan coast and continued to cement their presence in Nairobi and parts of the Somali border. <a href=\"http://www.issafrica.org/uploads/Paper265.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Many new recruits are Kenyan nationals.</a><br />So what drives people to join the Somalia-born Islamist extremist group? What can be done to prevent them doing so? The possible solutions shed light on what the role of development actors might be in countering violent extremism in Kenya and around the world.</p> <p><br />The reasons why people globally sign up to violent and extremist movements are complex, and Kenyan recruitment to al-Shabaab is no exception. Skewed governance, a heavy-handed police response – including raids, corralling and targeting of ethnic minorities – and corruption can and do play a part. A sense of historical injustice exists in zones of the country that have had little investment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/africa/horn-of-africa/kenya/b102-kenya-al-shabaab-closer-to-home.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Political neglect and feelings of ethnic and religious discrimination,</a> of Somalis and Muslims in particular, are rife along the coast and in the north-east. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/16/kenya-war-zone-alshabaab-islamist-militants-massacre\">Such sentiments are now stoked by Kenya’s military presence in Somalia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report/100412/gunned-down-in-mombasa-the-clerics-that-have-died\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Government’s clampdown on radical Islamic mosques.</a></p> <p>Economic factors are influential, but only when relative; when people perceive they are worse off than those around them. Poverty alone is rarely enough to push an individual towards al-Shabaab.<br /></p> <p><br />Conversely, Kenyans are also ‘pulled’ into radical Islam by their friends and peers and by a sense of belonging. <a href=\"http://www.issafrica.org/uploads/Paper265.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In a survey</a> of Kenyan al-Shabaab recruits carried out by the Institute of Security Studies, in 39% of cases friends played the most active part in recruitment and 87% reported feeling part of a group. Religious ideology is, of course, paramount, often serving to translate a local radical agenda into a universal rallying cause. In the same survey, 87% of Kenyan recruits admitted to joining for religious reasons, and many of them had been approached by a Muslim figure of some importance.<br /></p> <p><br />It is clear that drivers of radicalisation are often, in fact, development challenges as well – and there are ways to combat them. Police repression and corruption can be tackled through security sector reform. Increased civil society and government dialogue can help create middle ground between polarising forces and the space to air grievances without resorting to violence.<br /></p> <p><br />Government communications could likewise bolster a faltering social contract. Tolerant Islamic institutions with a strong voice might offer a counter-narrative to that put forward by al-Shabaab – and, preferably, a rejection of the latter’s ideology. Lastly, economic adversity is particularly amenable to improvements in job creation and vocational education.</p> <p><br />None of it will be easy: countering violent extremism generally takes place in a fraught and highly sensitive environment. The political and social divisions on which radical Islam draws run deep and may stand in the way of a rapprochement between opposing sides. Attempts to overhaul the relationship of the Kenyan police with citizens in an understandably security conscious country could run into opposition within the security establishment. It goes without saying that anything seen as Western ‘meddling’ in Muslim affairs would have unintended, and largely negative, consequences.<br /></p> <p><br />The particular nature of countering violent extremism interventions also requires a departure from the development norm, meaning that donors and implementing organisations may need to get used to a revised modus operandi. Programming needs to be based on a thorough grasp of politics, religion and society and to take into account the tensions that exist across all these areas. Development actors must accept a higher level of risk and be willing to partner with unconventional individuals and/or outfits.<br /></p> <p><br />Above all, initiatives need to be quick to react, to be flexible to success or failure, to be patient, and to target the right parts of the population and country. All of these should be reflected in results frameworks.</p> <p><br />Kenya is neither Nigeria nor Syria, and al-Shabaab is not equivalent to Boko Haram or the Islamic State. Drivers of radicalisation, and the response to them, vary country by country, and generally within countries as well. But similarities between them offer up lessons for how best to counter violent extremism.<br /><a href=\"http://blog.usaid.gov/2014/05/why-free-media-matters/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tolo TV, for example, was supported by USAID</a> to become an influential moderate voice in Afghanistan, whilst in West Africa informal associations of young people (known as fadas) have proved effective at channelling grievances and easing government engagement with the public arena.<br /></p> <p><br />For Kenya to prevent more Mandera-style attacks and get to grips with its domestic terror threat will require sustained, responsive and equitable development. Well-researched, realistic and adaptive development programming to counter violent extremism will have an important role to play in preventing al-Shabaab from establishing a full-blown regional insurgency.</p> <p><strong>Content managed and produced by Adam Smith International</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/adam-smith-international-partner-zone/2015/jan/16/overcoming-al-shabaab-in-kenya","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/adam-smith-international-partner-zone/2015/jan/16/overcoming-al-shabaab-in-kenya","sectionName":"Adam Smith International partner zone"},{"webTitle":"Kenya's tech visionaries lead the way","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-15T07:01:01Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2013/sep/15/kenya-technology-visionaries","fields":{"body":"<p>It is mid-morning in <a href=\"http://www.ihub.co.ke/\" title=\"http://www.ihub.co.ke/\">Nairobi's iHub</a>, a community space for techies and a kids' hackathon – where children as young as 10 are learning some of the basics of coding – is in full swing. The hangar-like space boasts table football, a coffee bar and an ambience that is more Seattle than African savannah.</p><p>Amid the eager people huddled over laptops and tablets is the towering figure of Erik Hersman, with his bald head and reddish beard. Known to most Kenyans online as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whiteafrican\" title=\"https://twitter.com/whiteafrican\">@WhiteAfrican</a>, the American, who grew up in East Africa, has become one of the most effective evangelists for the technological future of his adopted country.</p><p>The co-founder of both the iHub and <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a>, software, which has been used from Haiti to New Zealand to crowd-source information and map crises, wants to challenge the notion of Africa being a single entity blighted by wars and famine.</p><p>\"In the US I still get asked if they (Africans) have computers and mobile phones,\" he says.</p><p>When it comes to phones and Kenya, they certainly do. Six years ago the leading local telecom firm, <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\" title=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\">Safaricom</a>, noticed that its customers were sending mobile phone airtime to each other in lieu of cash. They decided to formalise this, calling it M-Pesa, from the Swahili for \"cash\", and enable subscribers to deposit money into a mobile account that they could then send to others or pay for things. Simple and text based, it worked on the most basic phones.</p><p>Today, Safaricom has almost as many subscribers as Kenya has adults and M-Pesa is used for everything from paying electricity bills and school fees to sending money to relatives upcountry. Cash equivalent to nearly one-third of Kenya's GDP [US$37.2bn in 2012] washed through the money-transfer service last year.</p><p>That success has given Kenya a global reputation as an outlier in the mobile money sector, while the impact of Ushahidi means that Nairobi is now looked to for software innovation.</p><p>This has been Africa's \"mobile decade\"; there are 74 mobile phones for every 100 Kenyans and, of those who access the internet, 99% do it via a mobile device.</p><p>The challenge, says Hersman, will be ensuring that \"five or 10 years from now Nairobi is Africa's tech hub\", ahead of the more populous Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city, or South Africa's wealthier Cape Town. There are signs everywhere that this is happening. Along the corridor in the same building as the iHub is a new office for the <a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/\" title=\"http://www.gsma.com/\">GSMA, the global telecoms trade association</a>.</p><p>Its  executive director, Anne Bouverot, says \"the rapid pace of mobile adoption has delivered an explosion of innovation and huge economic benefits\" and has pumped £20bn into the sub-Saharan African economy. She believes the mobile industry could also fuel the creation of nearly 15 million new jobs by 2020.</p><p>Much of that innovation is likely to happen within a few blocks of the iHub, an area now dubbed the \"silicon savannah\". Down Nairobi's busy Ngong Road two more tech hubs have been set up: <a href=\"http://www.88mph.ac/\" title=\"http://www.88mph.ac/\">\"88mph\", a seed fund and incubator</a>, and Innovation 4 Africa, a similar venture that shares the same space. A venture capital outfit, looking to invest in startups, called the Savannah Fund, in which Hersman is a partner, has opened above a fashionable bar on the same road.</p><p>And it's not just the locals who are interested in Nairobi. From the balcony of the iHub you can see an impressive new tower block that has sprung up to house the IBM Innovation Centre, the firm's first research lab in Africa. Fellow tech giants Intel, Nokia, Google and Microsoft are already in the city.</p><p>Sceptics have begun to ask where are the other success stories to rival M-Pesa but <a href=\"http://www.globalshapers.org/shapers/phares-kariuki\" title=\"http://www.globalshapers.org/shapers/phares-kariuki\">Phares Kariuki</a>, who left the world of banking to mentor entrepreneurs, says they are looking in the wrong place.</p><p>\"In Kenya everyone's opening a mobile venture trying to solve a problem that nobody has,\" says Kariuki.</p><p>Rather than smartphone apps for the small base of affluent consumers, the boom is happening in software that enables companies to do business.</p><p>These ventures are boring by comparison but are part of the reason why Kenya's export of technology-related services exploded from £11m in 2002 to £240m by 2010. Current estimates put that figure at more than £300m.</p><p>There is still a danger that the hype might suffocate innovation. While the Kenyan government deserves credit for delivering the undersea broadband cables that have helped internet access to treble since 2009, the tech boom has been largely a private enterprise.</p><p>The authorities are pinning their strategy on a site 40 miles outside Nairobi called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konza_Technology_City\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konza_Technology_City\">Konza Techno City</a>,  which boosters claim will turn the scrubland into a futuristic business district.

President Uhuru Kenyatta recently tapped two generals from the military to replace the heads of the intelligence agency and the immigration department.</p><p>Some 18,000 police recruits have been added to the security forces while Kenya is betting on technology to help improve its ability to monitor the activities of extremists.</p><p>The main telephone firm, Safaricom, famous for its pioneering work with M-Pesa money transfer technology, has been contracted to roll out a £103m ($170m) security and surveillance system.</p><p>Efforts to get justice for the victims continue in Kenyan courts, where four men have been charged with facilitating the attacks at the mall. Four suspected associates of the attackers – Hussein Hassan Mustafa, Mohammed Ahmed Abdi, Liban Abdullah Omar and Adan Mohammed Abdikadir – are due back in court on September 23.</p><p>The five-story Westgate mall is undergoing reconstruction although the area around it, which once buzzed with activity, with hundreds of taxis dropping and picking customers and peddlers selling everything from pet rabbits to sunglasses, is now largely quiet.</p><p>In Somalia, al-Shabaab have been on the back foot in recent times with a combined UN-funded mission of regional troops pushing them out of major population centres. The group's leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/05/al-shabaab-leader-godane-killed-us-airstrike-somalia\" title=\"\">Ahmed Godane, was killed in a US drone strike</a> on September 1.</p><p>Still, some have warned that al-Shabaab retains the ambition to carry out further attacks and one of the biggest worries is that the Westgate siege could be easily replicated by lightly resourced extremists.</p><p>A report by New York police concluded that the mall massacre \"clearly illustrates that armed assaults by terrorists are a simple, effective and easy to copy tactic\" and called for a rethink of policing systems to prevent such attacks.</p><p>Security forces around the world including agents from Britain and Israel have spent time in Kenya studying the Westgate assault. Kenyan police claim that they are now better prepared to thwart the Shabaab.</p><p>\"Our officers are currently on high alert to stop anything before it happens,\" the country's police chief, David Kimaiyo, told the Guardian. \"We rely on intelligence and our aim is to stop them before they carry out their plans.\"</p><p>Such assurances cut little ice with small-scale traders such as Sarah Njambi, a 28-year-old mother of one who says business at the Maasai market has virtually dried out.</p><p>\"I don't know where all the American and British tourists went. The government needs to do more to bring them back. We are really suffering. Now, we mainly get business from a few resident mzungus [white people] but they are not good customers because they know the prices. The green mzungus from abroad were great because they would pay much more.

drought insurance scheme shelters herders from financial storm | Daniel Howden","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-04T10:20:35Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2014/apr/04/kenya-drought-insurance-scheme","fields":{"body":"<p>It was almost inevitable that the day chosen to make the first drought insurance payments in Wajir, in the arid north-east of Kenya, would be the same day the rains came.</p><p>Herders who lost sheep, cattle and camels in the scorching first quarter of the year sheltered from the storm in an airless hall waiting for the cheques from an innovative new scheme that seeks to break the drought-and-bust cycle blighting pastoralists across the Horn of Africa.</p><p>No one among the weathered ranks of Somali herders thought a day of rain was a sign of easier seasons to come. \"Drought is always going to come,\" said the county governor, Ahmed Abdullahi Mohamad. \"If you have rains for two years you know that in the third year they will fail. The question is how we build the systems to deal with drought.\"</p><p>This is a question that has hung over Andrew Mude, a Kenyan economist, for the past six years. Working with the <a href=\"http://www.ilri.org\" title=\"\">International Livestock Research Institute</a> (ILRI) in the capital, Nairobi, he has brought to bear satellite technology and 30 years of data on drought and herd losses in quest of a solution.</p><p>It is impossible to monitor, accurately, the deaths of animals in herds that range across some of the most remote and inhospitable terrain on Earth, so Mude elected to concentrate on what could be measured – the vegetation. Freely available satellite images show the condition of pasture, or forage, in sufficient detail to calculate the extent of drought. His index-based livestock insurance works by protecting the vegetation, not the animals. When a drought is calculated to have exceeded a certain trigger level (15% in Wajir) the insurer pays out.</p><p>Designing a smart product is one thing, persuading people whose livelihood has remained largely unchanged for decades – if not centuries – is another. Few of the Kenyan-Somalis whose animals range across the semi-arid expanse around Wajir have any experience of insurance; only a handful of them are car or motorbike owners, or would insure their home or its contents. \"People must learn that the insurance will pay off,\" Mude said. \"We must generate trust and, as with any business, early adopters are a minority.\"</p><p>Like so many of his peers, Ahmed Mohamed, 21, a herder, has been slowly rebuilding his numbers after the last serious drought in 2011, where he lost two-thirds of his 30 goats and sheep. This year he has lost three of his animals. It was enough to persuade him to try something new. He insured five of the herd for 2,000 Kenyan shilings (£14) and has received most of it back with an indemnity of £13 after a comparatively mild failure of the rains.</p><p>One of his father's friends, Abdi Aden Bule, 65, hopes the insurance can prevent another disaster like the one he suffered during the severe drought three years ago. From being a \"wealthy man\" with 50 head of cattle, 200 sheep and goats and 10 camels, he was left with two camels, 10 cows and 30 goats.</p><p>\"The drought doesn't say when it's coming but comes,\" he said. \"But there's not any other source of wealth here, we are not farmers and we have no arable land. At least if you have animals you will not go hungry.\"</p><p>The ILRI's other major challenge has been to persuade insurance companies to partner with them. That was until he found Hassan Bashir, the chief executive of Takaful insurance, and the son of a herder from Wajir.

But the idea is equally applicable to other sectors – such as farming – and recent research into volunteer farmer trainers (VFTs) shows how lessons from community health worker schemes have informed the effectiveness of using farmers as agents of change.</p><p>The research into VFTs has been based on their use in the <a href=\"http://www.heifer.org/eadd/index.html\" title=\"\">East Africa Dairy Development (EADD)</a> project, a collaboration launched in 2008 between Heifer International, the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), Technoserve, the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), and African Breeders Services (ABS). The project's first phase aimed to double the incomes of 179,000 dairy farmers in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.</p><p>Volunteer farmer trainers are an integral part of the EADD, designed to augment the over-stretched formal extension system.</p><p>\"In Uganda for example, we have an estimated 4 million smallholder farmers served by 4,000 technical extension workers,\" says William Matovu, Heifer's country director.</p><p>\"So one extension worker is serving a thousand smallholder farmers. The only way we can support the system is by ensuring we have robust communities with farmer trainers.\"</p><p>Volunteer farmer trainers are initially trained in feed and feeding systems on an intensive, two-day course, and they then train fellow farmers in their immediate community, usually other members of a dairy group. The training includes the growing of livestock feed crops and feed conservation techniques such as silage making, hay baling, and management of crop residues.</p><p>Trainers use demonstration plots on their own land, but on average, each volunteer farmer trainer also reaches five villages outside of their own, travelling mostly on foot and covering up to 4 miles a day.</p><p>Between 2009 and 2012, the volume of milk sold by farmers involved in the EADD increased by 102%, and in June this year, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-013-9463-5\" title=\"\">an in-depth study into the VFT programme</a> was published, analysing the motivations of its participants.</p><p>This understanding is important because research by organisations including the World Health Organisation has identified high rates of attrition as one of the key challenges in community health worker programmes. Recommendations made by WHO on <a href=\"http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/12/11-087825/en/\" title=\"\">how to mitigate this</a> include ensuring a robust selection system, some kind of incentive, ongoing training, and a system of recognition.</p><p>This thinking has been embedded in the VFT scheme. Recruitment of volunteer farmers, for example, is a community-based process based on criteria presented by both EADD and the community itself.</p><p>\"The community makes the decision with our input,\" says Steven Franzel, principal agricultural economist at ICRAF and co-author of the report.</p><p>\"They have to be resident in the community, be dairy farmers, and interested in helping others. Literacy is often one of the requirements, depending on how the community feels.\"</p><p>Perhaps the most important finding of the VFT study was that while income generation wasn't the greatest factor in motivating farmers to sign up (other motivations included altruism, social factors and access to training) it did become a key factor in retention. Farmer trainers have found they can earn income from selling planting materials  or providing training services – for a fee – to people from outside their immediate community.</p><p>This benefit may be contributing to the relatively low levels of VFT attrition.</p><p>\"We've found 80% of trainers have been retained,\" says Matovu. \"The strategy for retaining them has been based on financial incentive mechanisms and preparing them as entrepreneurs for knowledge and information&nbsp;sharing and technological transfer within&nbsp;communities.\"</p><p>The EADD showed that there are limitations to community-based training.</p><p>\"It doesn't work everywhere in every circumstance,\" says Franzel. \"One example is low population areas, where people don't get around enough and don't have transport. The second is with relatively high-risk complex technology. We deal with feed technologies, where the costs of making a mistake are relatively low.\"</p><p>The key message from the VFT study is that volunteer trainer systems can work, but to be sustainable they need to be carefully structured to give something back to the trainers. Entrepreneurial opportunities are a motivator, and so is social recognition and exposure, which can be achieved through certification and even branded T-shirts and caps.</p><p>Given the importance of smallholder farming in the developing world, the potential of farmer trainers is something we cannot afford to ignore, says Franzel.</p><p>\"It's been way underexploited. Funds for public extension have seen huge cuts over the years, partly because they weren't performing well, so we see this as a model that both empowers local communities and can be very effective.\"</p><p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/18/agriculture-africa-youth-unemployment-montpellier-report\" title=\"\">How to inspire a generation of farming entrepreneurs</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/16/fake-seeds-uganda\" title=\"\">Fake seeds are keeping Uganda's farmers poor</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/31/growing-coca-heroin-peru-thailand\" title=\"\">Growing drugs in Peru: finding profitable alternatives for coca farmers</a></p><p><strong>Join the community of global development professionals and experts. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\" title=\"\"><strong>Become a GDPN member</strong></a><strong> to get more stories like this direct to your inbox</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/05/kenya-uganda-rwanda-dairy-farming-training","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/aug/05/kenya-uganda-rwanda-dairy-farming-training","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"Technology-based mobile health takes off in developing countries","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-22T06:00:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/technology-mobile-health-developing-countries","fields":{"body":"<p>Soon opticians – and even their assistants – will be able to check people's vision using just a mobile phone, and it won't matter if they're not sure what they're seeing because the phone will know what to look for. Space-age future? Far from it. The eye-miracle phone is already here. In fact, it's being used in the world's poorest countries.</p><p>\"Smartphones have been getting better and better, and the fortuitous coincidence is that their optical elements are so small, in fact smaller than a pupil\", explains Dr Iain Livingstone, a paediatric ophthalmologist at <a href=\"http://www.peekvision.org/\" title=\"\">Peekvision</a>, the UK-based organisation behind the technology. \"With a few tweaks, we can put that to our advantage.\"</p><p>Peekvision's technology utilises an ordinary smartphone, which can be used in place of the expensive and complicated ophthalmoscopes that have been a mainstay of eye exams for decades. This is how it works: an optician or even a minimally trained healthcare worker points the adjusted smartphone into the patient's eye. The phone automatically focuses on what it's supposed to look for – say, a cataract – and captures the image, allowing the healthcare worker to send it on to more qualified experts by email or text message. </p><p>\"That circumvents the training an optician needs in order to operate an ophthalmoscope and understand its results\", says Livingstone. \"Anybody can conduct the eye exam.\"</p><p>With blindness being preventable in 80% of cases, there's an obvious need for eye exams, especially in the developing world. Peekvision's mobile phone has already been introduced in Kenya (and Scotland) and found to reliably identify and photograph not just cataracts but severe diabetes and macular degeneration as well. All three are leading causes of blindness. In fact, Peekvision – which is supported by the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Medical Research Council and several other institutions – is just one of many new startups and non-profits trying to merge high-tech and healthcare in developing countries. </p><p>Researchers at Harvard and MIT, for example, <a href=\"http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-08-30/news/27610987_1_chronic-diseases-detection-smart-phones\" title=\"\">have developed a technology</a> that allows medical assessments to be encoded onto smart-phones, links with ultrasound and x-ray machines, and sends the information to a central database. <a href=\"http://medicmobile.org/\" title=\"\">Medic Mobile</a>, started in a Stanford dorm room several years ago, allows healthcare workers to monitor patients far from clinics using a mobile application. Indeed mobile health (mHealth, in today's jargon) is growing rapidly, with PWC <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pwc.in%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Ftelecom%2Fgsma-pwc_mhealth_report.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3wH5VtJ0mZerleK5PrMMDE_02BQ\" title=\"\">predicting a $23bn</a> (pdf) market by 2013, up from $500m in 2010.</p><p>Here's the challenge: even though developing countries, with their less extensive healthcare infrastructure, would benefit the most from mobile health, they're only predicted to account for a small share of the market, in Africa's case 5% by 2017, according to PWC. And even though their smartphone penetration rates are expected to climb from today's <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgsmaintelligence.com%2Ffiles%2Fanalysis%2F%3Ffile%3D130828-scaling-mobile.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEFhMa0CVse5O46GlfIDzPa5fjDrQ\" title=\"\">average of 8%</a> (pdf), emerging economies won't be a massive smartphone market anytime soon. <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-06/cmaj-mhd061113.php\" title=\"\">Writing in the Canadian Medical Association Journal</a> last year, Dr Ivan Mendez of the University of Saskatchewan notes that undependable signal strength poses another challenge to smartphone-driven healthcare in developing countries.</p><p>But, says Tom Walker, CEO of Lionsgate Technologies, his company's business plan doesn't rest on selling lots of healthtech-equipped smartphones in developing countries. On the contrary, its strategy is to simultaneously tap into mobile health in both wealthy and emerging markets. The Vancouver-based company has developed smartphone applications where the phone screen acts as a monitor, while a sensor is connected to the audioport.</p><p>\"The phone can be used as a diagnostic tool for the developing world and a self-diagnostic tool in the developed world\", explains Walker. \"There's no reason that a low-cost blood-pressure tool can't sell well in, for example, the north American market.\"</p><p>In Lionsgate's business model, sales in the developed world will essentially underwrite activities in emerging markets. The company's applications for the developing world focus on healthcare workers using smartphones equipped with the technology to diagnose common diseases and medical problems such as pneumonia and preeclampsia. In wealthy countries, by contrast, it will give patients suffering from chronic conditions the option of managing some parts of their illnesses on their own. For example, the same application that's used to diagnose pneumonia in the developing world can be used by patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases in the United States, allowing them to make regular readings using simply the specially equipped smartphone. That's a potentially huge saving in healthcare costs. Given that chronic illnesses <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fchronicdisease%2Fpdf%2F2009-power-of-prevention.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdLaw26xUp0Kdn9Xk1-iJFjEeVDA\" title=\"\">account for 75%</a> of healthcare spending in the United States, for example, the market could clearly take a lucrative turn for LionsGate and companies like it. Indeed, two-year-old Lionsgate expects to be profitable by 2016.</p><p>To be sure, Americans and Brits won't be conducting their own blood oxygen readings en masse any time soon. But for perhaps the first time ever, they may soon be using the same healthcare solutions as their fellow patients in the developing world.</p><p><em>The role of business in development hub is funded by Business Call to Action.

Professor Judy Wakhungu, appointed minister of environment, water and natural resources in April, described the find as extremely significant. \"It is not too deep and ought not to be not too expensive to develop,\" she added.</p><p>Wakhungu said Kenya plans to use the technology to map the entire country: \"We are excited to be able to provide a national map of the country's water resources.\"</p><p>The barren semi-desert Turkana region is home to about 700,000 people. Most live off their herds of camels, goats and sheep. Temperatures rarely fall below 30C and water is scarce. \"Many people have to live on around 10 litres of water a day,\" said Brian McSorley, Oxfam's water expert in Nairobi. \"This is half the minimum daily requirement.\"</p><p>The aquifers could change the lives of people in the region. One, close to the main town of Lodwar, is said to have a proven reserve of 10 billion cubic metres of fresh water. The other, the Lotikipi basin, further north, towards the Sudanese border, is even larger, holding at least 200 billion cubic metres of water.</p><p>These aquifers are being recharged from the surrounding plains and hills, an area of 21,000 sq km, The study indicates it is being replenished at a rate of 1.2 billion cubic metres a year – more than enough to supply the entire county.</p><p>The UN scientific and cultural organisation, Unesco, backed a France-based company, Radar Technologies, founded by Alain Gachet, which began the search for the water in November. Gachet, who cut his teeth as an exploration geologist in the oil industry, developed the Watex technology to interpret radar and oil exploration data in order to explore for water.</p><p>\"We processed imagery from the pace shuttle,\" Gachet said. \"This allowed us to build up a detailed surface map. Then we interpreted radar imagery from the Japanese space agency and deep seismic data from the oil industry. With this approach, we were able to peel back the surface of the earth like an onion.\"</p><p>Among his first customers was the UN refugee agency. At the height of the Darfur crisis, the technology helped supply the refugee camps that sprang up in the desolate regions of eastern Chad, as people streamed across the border to escape the war.</p><p>The technology produces detailed maps indicating where water has accumulated deep beneath the surface. Test wells are then drilled to validate the findings. This has been done in Turkana and water was found less than 50 metres from the surface. As drilling progressed to a depth of 330 metres, three layers of the aquifer were discovered.</p><p>\"They are like a series of interconnected pancakes,\" said Casey Walther, a water expert who was a consultant with Unesco on the project, and now works with Gachet. \"Water flows between the layers.\"</p><p>McSorley said when he heard of the study he checked the technical possibility of using radar imaging with Oxfam's experts in the UK. \"The concept is not revolutionary, but the science is good,\" he added.</p><p>But getting the water to the scattered people of Turkana will be no easy matter. This is among the most remote and lawless regions of Kenya. There are sporadic raids from neighbouring Uganda, Sudan and Ethiopia. Drought and disputes over livestock have plagued the area for generations. The Turkana, Samburu and Pokot people have traditionally engaged in cattle raids, but in recent years these have increased in intensity, leaving many dead.</p><p>Oxfam gave a cautious welcome to the finds. McSorley believes the real test will be whether the infrastructure will be installed to allow the water to reach local people. He has been working at the giant Dadaab refugee camp in north-eastern Kenya for years. This lies close to another giant aquifer, but getting access to the water is not easy.</p><p>\"Groundwater resources here are not an issue but many of the surrounding communities still lack a borehole or the pumps to access it,\" he said. \"Those that do cannot always afford the fuel to operate the generator to power the pump or have the cash to service and maintain the equipment.\"</p><p>Turkana lies just south of the Ilemi triangle, a disputed border region, whose exact boundaries have never been agreed upon by neighbouring states. Quarrels over where the border runs began during the colonial period and continue to this day.</p><p>Attempting to police this remote region has been expensive. In the 1920s, British officials in Kenya and Sudan attempted to pass responsibility to one another to escape bearing the cost of the operation. The result was a dotted border running between the countries, leaving plenty of room for disputes.</p><p>Angela Docherty, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.newways.org.uk/about-us/Where-we-work.aspx\" title=\"\">New Ways</a>, one of the few charities working in the Ilemi triangle, says poverty breeds these skirmishes. \"All conflicts relate to scarcity of resources. Everyone is trying to survive.\"</p><p>Concern has increased in recent years, as oil finds have crept closer to the disputed border. The UK-based Tullow Oil company has been drilling in the area and found signs of oil in the Lokichar basin, south of Lodwar. The reserves are not yet proven, but if the region has oil and water, international attention is certain to be focused on the area.</p><p>Asked whether the combination of poorly defined borders and these important resources could raise difficulties for Kenya. Wakhungu told the Guardian that all the country's borders have issues with transboundary water. \"We manage these very carefully, but I can't worry about the diplomacy. My brief is to look at the water resources.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/11/kenya-water-discovery-drought-relief","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/sep/11/kenya-water-discovery-drought-relief","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Shaking off the energy crisis: how far can kinetic deliver on its promises?","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-30T10:00:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/30/energy-kinetic-renewables-kenya","fields":{"body":"<p>When the sun sets in Kenya, tens of millions of people set about the daily challenge of lighting their homes.

Shaken for 12 minutes, it can yield an hour of power.</p><p>Children trialling the shaker in western Kenya have responded positively to trials, according to Kheterpal, learning about it in school and using the energy at home to create light for reading, school work and charging mobile phones. A crowdfunding campaign is now in place to raise £50,000 to reach an initial 1,000 children. Central to this will be optimising the shaker design and materials, and seeking manufacturing and distribution partners.</p><p>\"I hope to encourage maximum take-up by developing an assembly kit, so children can build their own shaker,\" explains Kheterpal. \"In the long-term, I'd like to reach children learning about kinetic and renewable energy in Africa, India and Brazil.\"</p><p>While Kheterpal and her team seek to bring a creative, educational solution to a very real development need, they will face some steep challenges to bring the initiative to scale. Gaining sufficient investment will be fundamental, as will defining exactly how the project could be sustained for the long-term in a way that responds effectively to the needs of users and protects the environment. Affordability will be critical, and moreover, will people embrace the idea of producing energy themselves?</p><p>\"The shaker has promise for low energy applications such as low power lights and limited charging of mobile phones,\" says Ioannis Kymissis, associate professor of electrical engineering at New York's Columbia University.</p><p>Anne Wheldon, renewable energy expert and Ashden adviser says:\" When tackling a pressing development need, it's vital to engage with people on the ground to understand what they want.</p><p>\"Shaking a musical instrument may be fun and engaging initially, but its success will ultimately be determined by whether children want to use it for the long-term. It must also be simple and cost-effective to distribute and repair, and commercially viable for the manufacturer to offer warranties.\"</p><p>She said investors and grant-makers would look at how a kinetic energy harvesting solution performs compared to an equivalent competitor solution. \"With solar innovations now starting to reach scale, any initiative seeking to harness energy from human activity would need to perform at least as well in order to attract serious funding.\"</p><p>The shaker is one of many kinetic products emerging to solve the energy crisis. A product design firm Unchartered Play raised $92,200 (£54,328) in March 2014 to manufacture and distribute the <a href=\"http://www.sporttechie.com/2013/07/01/energy-harnessing-soccer-ball-provides-electricity-for-off-grid-communities/\" title=\"\">Soccet</a>, a football that converts kinetic energy into electricity via a pendulum-like mechanism, powering an LED light for three hours after 30 minutes of play.</p><p>\"Various kinetic energy projects have been introduced in Africa over time, but none of these has taken off at scale,\" says Brenda Martin of the World Future Council. \"Aspiration for energy security in Africa generally continues to be for a conventional, 'flick of a switch' supply. However, if small-scale innovations boost the local economy, use good quality components, change children's quality of life and are affordable, they can play a role in promoting energy access.\"</p><p>The Kenyan schools visited by Kheterpal taught pupils about renewable energy but lacked a way to demonstrate it. Providing pupils with shaker assembly kits could help them to put theory into practice, their teachers concurred. And this could also inspire confidence in the benefits of other renewable technologies, according to Wim Jonker Klunne, senior renewable energy researcher at the CSIR.</p><p>\"The percussion shaker may prove of more interest from an educational perspective,\" says Klunne. \"It's great to help children understand how energy is generated, and show them that small amounts of energy can bring big improvements to life.\"</p><p>As work continues to deliver a permanent, affordable electricity supply for all in Africa, kinetic energy solutions can provide a sustainable alternative to kerosene lamps for low energy needs. A few extra hours of LED-powered light saves people money, reduces their exposure to smoky fumes and provides valuable time to work, study or innovate. Above all, innovations like the percussion shaker can be used to bring renewable energy to life for the next generation of Africans, shining a light on the possibilities for a clean, secure energy future.</p><p><strong>Read more stories like this: </strong></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/quiz/2014/jun/05/renewable-energy-what-do-you-know\" title=\"\">Quiz: what do you know about renewable energy?</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/05/chile-renewable-energy-solar-power\" title=\"\">Chile's solar market is leading the way in South America</a></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/05/chile-renewable-energy-solar-power\" title=\"\">Who will fund the renewable solution to the energy crisis?</a></p><p><strong>Join the community of global development professionals and experts. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\" title=\"\"><strong>Become a GDPN member</strong></a><strong> to get more stories like this direct to your inbox</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/30/energy-kinetic-renewables-kenya","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/30/energy-kinetic-renewables-kenya","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"Kenya at 50: much to celebrate – and to worry about | Anthony Muheria","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-12T10:15:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2013/dec/12/kenya-50-celebrate-worry-about-independence","fields":{"body":"<p>In 1963, Kenya won independence from the UK after a long, drawn-out guerrilla war, dotted with intermittent negotiations with the then colonial leaders.

That’s why I know we need to talk about it | Domtila Chesang","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-06T11:52:47Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2015/feb/06/i-witnessed-fgm-cut-kenya","fields":{"body":"<p>When I was young, I thought that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/06/un-zero-tolerance-fgm-female-genital-mutilation\">female genital mutilation</a> or Tum, as we called the ceremony, was no different from the other practices and occasions girls were expected to attend.</p> <p>At that time I didn’t know that the majority of other tribes in Kenya don’t practise FGM, let alone all the other people outside my country who did not follow the practice. In fact, I loved the ceremony, the dancing, the singing the celebration – and eating lots of meat.</p> <p>FGM is carried out in two stages: the first is the removal of the clitoris, which is done within seconds. Around five in the morning, immediately after the girls have been taken to the river to take a cold shower (meant to make them numb), they come to sit on stones that are arranged in line in an open field, with everyone closely watching.</p> <p>At the entrance to the field, two men stand with spears crossing overhead, which the girls run under as they take their place in the field. During my childhood, as many as 30 girls sometimes took part. Most of the time you would see a smile on the faces of the girls after this first stage. It didn’t scare me then.</p> <p>The second stage comes immediately after, but the difference is that only the women who have already undergone this stage themselves are permitted to take part. Therefore the younger girls and the men have no clue what’s going on. And this is one of the reasons that FGM continues; no one knows the details. If men understood what exactly took place, they wouldn’t let their daughters go through it.</p> <p>The young girls have no idea what is coming in the second stage – the mothers remember, but believe they have no choice. The powerful men have not said stop and so it simply continues. It is on no one’s political agenda.</p> <p>One morning I was curious to find out. I sneaked into the nearby bush where it was happening, and wasn’t noticed until I had witnessed everything that I needed to know and leaves had been spread on the ground for the girls to lie on their backs. No matter how many girls are having it done, it is always carried out by one circumciser, who uses one knife to cut them all one after the other.</p> <p>In this case my cousin was the first on the line. Six other women pinned her down, holding her head, hands, legs, with one sitting on her chest, overpowering her completely, with more than 10 other women watching while singing. The cutter, with her homemade curved knife, was bending over her.</p> <p>When all my cousin’s genitals were out, there was nothing left but red, bare flesh, I realised something was terribly wrong. My cousin lay naked and screaming on the ground. She was to stay in a secluded place for a month with her legs tied together to help close up the wound, leaving a tiny hole and achieving a new shape altogether. All this for the sake of a rite of passage and transition from childhood to adulthood. Failure to undergo FGM renders you unmarriable because you are seen as a child, no matter your age. You will be an outcast to the community, shown no respect and be locked out of certain activities in the community.</p> <p>FGM and anything related to it is never discussed at home or anywhere else: it is regarded as a taboo subject.</p> <p>After watching my cousin’s cutting, I ran home, scared and sick. I asked my mum that evening why it was happening but she was not allowed to discuss it. Women therefore suffer silently through the pain, trauma, bleeding, during sexual intercourse, complications during childbirth.</p> <p>The community deals with FGM-related complications by creating scapegoats and superstitions. For instance, if a girl bleeds heavily after the cut, it is believed that she has been bewitched or has had a sexual affair with a man the previous night.</p> <p>If a woman has prolonged labour, which is very common, as the hole left after FGM is too small for the baby to pass through, and the cervix cannot expand due to the scar tissue, then it is believed that this woman was unfaithful to her husband.</p> <p>The practice of FGM continues today because there is very little awareness-raising in the communities. It remains unchallenged so it goes on.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://mobile.nation.co.ke/counties/Drive-against-FGM-in-top-gear/-/1950480/2567038/-/format/xhtml/-/q5jto6/-/index.html\">poster campaign competition</a> in my home town sponsored by the Guardian was an eye-opener for both men and women, illiterate and literate. It started a conversation. The young girls who took part in the poster competition were given a chance to speak up for themselves. I am from a society which believes that girls are a source of wealth, the bride price that they fetch after the cut is a ticket to marriage.</p> <p>The stigma needs to be fought, girls and women need to be empowered, the whole community need to be sensitised on the effects of FGM. The media needs to create awareness by talking openly about FGM. If we can continue to team up with the journalists, bring together local radio stations to discuss it, and train journalists on how to talk openly about FGM, I believe we have a chance of bringing the practice to an end.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/06/i-witnessed-fgm-cut-kenya","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/06/i-witnessed-fgm-cut-kenya","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"How has Kenya changed since independence? – get the data","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-12T07:00:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/datablog/2013/dec/12/kenya-how-changed-independence-data","fields":{"body":"<p>As Kenya marks 50 years of independence from Great Britain on Thursday, politicians, commentators and citizens are reflecting on how the country has changed – and looking ahead to what the next-half century has in store.</p><p>Commemorative stamps have been printed, more than 60,000 people are expected at a concert in Nairobi on Thursday, and the anniversary has kicked off a lively discussion <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KenyaAt50&amp;src=hash\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a>, with messages of celebration intermingled with concern for the country's future.

However, no set of statistics can fully capture the changes the country and its citizens have experienced. Let us know in the thread below what you think is missing.</p><h2>Population</h2><p>Kenya's population has more than quadrupled since 1963, growing from more than 8.1m to more than 43m people. Today, Kenya has the sixth highest population in sub-Saharan Africa, behind Tanzania, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Nigeria.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424800363'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386786410136/Picture_297.png' alt='Life expectancy' width='416' height='324' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Life expectancy has risen from 48 years in 1963 to 60 in 2011, above the 56-year average for sub-Saharan Africa. But life expectancy in Kenya today is the same as it was in the mid-1980s, having dropped to a low of 52.8 years in 2002 before rising again.</p><h2>Economy</h2><p>Kenya is one of Africa's \"lion economies\", according to business commentators who continue to gape at the high levels of economic growth on the continent. East Africa's largest economy, Kenya has a set of ambitious targets in its bid to become a middle-income country by 2030.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424800364'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386784649522/Picture_291.png' alt='gni capita kenya' width='426' height='309' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Note: Atlas method, current US$</figcaption></figure><p>In 1963, Kenya's gross national income (GNI) per capita stood at about $100. By 2012, that figure was estimated at $850. Economies reach the World Bank's lower middle-income category when their GNI per capita surpasses $1,036.</p><h2>Poverty</h2><p>Poverty levels remain high in Kenya. The country is unlikely to meet the millennium development goal (MDG) to halve extreme poverty by 2015. The most recent data suggests roughly 45% of the population lives on less than $1.25 a day, and more than 65% on less than $2.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424800365'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386785309677/Picture_295.png' alt='poverty kenya' width='417' height='321' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Note: poverty headcount ratio at $1.25/day (PPP)</figcaption></figure><p>While progress has been made since 2000, when an estimated 52% of people lived on less than $1.25 a day, more people live in poverty in Kenya today than in the early 1990s.</p><h2>Health</h2><p>Kenya will also struggle to meet many health-related MDGs, despite progress in a number of areas. Child mortality rates, for example, have dropped significantly since independence. In 1963, about 175 children under five were dying per 1,000 live births; by 2011, that figure had fallen to less than 73. The proportion of people living with HIV, meanwhile, has fallen from a high of 10% in the late 1990s to 6% in 2012.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424800366'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386784512612/Picture_289.png' alt='child mortality kenya' width='415' height='324' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><br />Government spending on health remains low, at less than 6% of national expenditures in 2011, compared with 11% in neighbouring Tanzania. There are still fewer than 20 doctors per 100,000 people in Kenya, though this is significantly higher than in the 1960s, when that number was closer to eight.</p><h2>Mobile phones</h2><p>Kenya is now seen as almost synonymous with African technology and innovation. Stories about the growth of mobile phone use – and related innovations such as M-Pesa, which allows people to transfer money using a mobile phone – have played a large part in this.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424800367'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386784689731/Picture_292.png' alt='mobile phones' width='411' height='321' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In 2012, there were more than 71 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 Kenyans – significantly more than in neighbouring Tanzania, where the figure is 57, and sub-Saharan Africa, where the average is 53. In the context of the past half-century, however, mobile phone use is still a new phenomenon.</p><h2>What do you think?</h2><p>No five charts could ever capture the changes and dynamics of a country over 50 years.

But this month, the country <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN0HA1DT20140915\">reintroduced capital gains tax</a> (CGT) on companies and individuals, 30 years after abandoning it.<br /></p> <p>It is not the only good news to have come out of Kenya recently. Last October, the government announced <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net/2014/10/29/exciting-times-kenya/\">plans to retire many corporate tax holidays</a>, in a bid to reduce bureaucratic red tape. The move will broaden the tax base and generate more resources to fund essential services, especially for people living in poverty.</p> <p>Despite the predictable warnings of big companies and wealthy individuals, the return of CGT and the rolling back of tax incentives are good news for the vast majority of Kenyans, who rely on public services. If those services – from midwives and ambulances to roads and policing – are to be better funded, then tax is the answer. It is cheaper than government borrowing, and more reliable and less conditional than aid.</p> <p>The new CGT will be levied on profits made from the sale of property and shares. Kenya suspended CGT in 1985, when the Nairobi stock exchange was started, and it has been very difficult to bring back, even though the exchange has more than 2tn Kenyan shillings (£14bn) in market capitalisation.</p> <p>Ministers have finally kept their nerve with CGT because they want to boost revenues in order to spend more – and even <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2014/pr14518.htm\">the IMF has encouraged them to raise tax</a> to pay for greater government spending. They may also have been comforted by the fact that neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda have much higher tax rates on capital gains. Officials have reportedly estimated that CGT in Kenya – at a rate of 5% – will raise about $85m (£56m) a year.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Return-of-Kenya-capital-gains-tax-was-overdue/-/2560/2443472/-/mem3gq/-/index.html\">Kenya’s CGT has had a painful birth</a>. Like other reforms that would more fairly share the tax burden, it became difficult to get it through parliament and may be hard to implement, even now it has become law. Some parliamentarians are too easily convinced about the supposed adverse macroeconomic effects of reforms aimed at powerful institutions like <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-11-26/kenyan-exchange-sees-tax-change-curbing-foreign-investment\">the stock exchange</a> or booming industries such as the real-estate sector.</p> <p>By contrast, proposals to increase the tax burden on poor people pass through parliament in record time. After all, the poor are not as organised or as obviously powerful as the elite. Nothing exemplifies this more than <a href=\"https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/blog/onesource/indirect-tax/kenya-basic-goods-subject-to-16-vat/\">the speedy enactment of VAT in 2013</a>, on the one hand, and the long struggle to reintroduce CGT, on the other.</p> <p>VAT is a tax on consumption. It is considered regressive because everyone pays the same amount of tax on a product, regardless of their income. This would not be a problem if VAT was levied only on luxury products like helicopters (which it is not in Kenya). But when levied on essentials like milk and bread, it threatens to put those out of poor people’s reach.</p> <p>Kenyan civil society has had some influence and, in 2013, the <a href=\"http://eatgn.org/\">East Africa Tax and Governance Network</a>, a Christian Aid partner, played a critical role in amending the 2013 VAT Act, to <a href=\"http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000094211/treasury-yields-to-pressure-pulls-fresh-milk-from-vat-bracket\">reverse the milk and bread price hikes</a>.</p> <p>The network continues to campaign for additional tax bands on personal income as an alternative to VAT – and more progressive taxation is clearly needed. The UN has consistently ranked Kenya as one of the <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/files/DPDCPKEN2_UNDAF.pdf\">most unequal states</a> (pdf). On the ground, this is evident in the luxury flats and high-end vehicle dealerships popping up all over Nairobi, in stark contrast to news of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/30/kenya-drought-food-starvation\">drought in hunger-ravaged northern Kenya</a>.</p> <p>One of the obstacles to more progressive taxation is that it is difficult to distinguish between <a href=\"http://mobile.nation.co.ke/news/Kenyans-Wealth-Families-Politicians/-/1950946/2215578/-/format/xhtml/-/krwmhtz/-/index.html\">rich people and politicians</a>. They are mostly one and the same – search who the richest Kenyans are and the list will consist of former cabinet ministers and presidents. Any minister would hesitate to go against the interests of such a formidable group, as CGT is bound to do.</p> <p>With the introduction of the new tax, ordinary Kenyans must hope that the frantic tax-planning efforts by some, such as selling their prime assets, will not render <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Tax/International-Tax/Alert--Kenya-reintroduces-capital-gains-tax\">CGT</a> ineffective and deter further efforts towards fairness in Kenya’s tax system.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/23/kenya-capital-gains-tax-boost-spending-poor","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/jan/23/kenya-capital-gains-tax-boost-spending-poor","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"The foodie traveller … Searching for the perfect barbecue in Nairobi, Kenya","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-01T06:59:06Z","sectionId":"travel","id":"travel/2015/feb/01/foodie-traveller-barbecue-meat-nairobi-kenya","fields":{"body":"<p><em>Nyama choma</em>, “grilled meat” in Kiswahili, is barbecue stripped down to its raw elements.

Inside the vehicle, bumping across the plain, were 91 people travelling from their old home, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/mar/24/dadaab-refugee-camps-living-in-crisis\">Dadaab refugee camp</a> in northern Kenya, to an even older one: the port city of Kismayo in southern Somalia, from where they had fled war and famine nearly four years ago.<br /></p> <p>The bus was the first in a pilot project run by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, facilitating what is called “spontaneous, voluntary returns” of refugees to Somalia. Four more buses have since departed for Somalia, returning home a total of 602 people. A sixth was postponed due to security concerns. <br /></p> <p>The controversial aspect is that Somalia is still at war, food shortages are widespread, and access for humanitarians is difficult along roads blocked by fighting and checkpoints established by the insurgent group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab\">al-Shabaab</a>.<br /></p> <p>The same month as the returns began, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Somalia, Philippe Lazzarini, <a href=\"http://mobile.nation.co.ke/news/UN-seeks-863m-dollars-for-Somalia-aid/-/1950946/2556402/-/format/xhtml/-/d0kqm0z/-/index.html\">appealed for nearly $900m in 2015</a>, warning: “For the first time since the 2011 famine, the number of people in need of life-saving assistance has increased. Over a million Somalis are unable to meet their basic food requirements. A further 2.1 million people are on the verge of acute food insecurity, bringing the total number of people in need of humanitarian assistance to 3.2 million.”<br /></p> <p>Kenya has waged a long campaign to encourage the refugees to return, even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/16/kenyan-troops-somalia-kidnappings\">invading Somalia in 2011</a> in part to create a safe area where the refugees could be settled.

UN officials have said they expect it still to exist in 10 years’ time. Though the numbers going back are tiny, the return agenda is shaping both policy and individual refugee decisions.</p> <p>Donors have been quick to encourage returns and trim budgets in Dadaab. Last year, NGOs leapt to pitch for programmes supporting returns while cutting other activities in the camp. And when, at the end of last year, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/01/syrian-refugees-food-crisis-un-world-programme\">World Food Programme (WFP) ran short of money globally</a> and asked rich governments for help, Syria, South Sudan and Central African Republic were prioritised while the Kenya operation was among those that took a hit.<br /></p> <p>In November and December, the WFP was forced to halve food rations – normally about 3kg of dry sorghum and maize a person weekly. A group of vulnerable women left their babies at the gates of a Dadaab food warehouse in protest. Despite a vigorous WFP campaign explaining otherwise, to the refugees it was all part of the same conspiracy: to force them back to Somalia. “1.5kg a week? A person cannot stay here,” said Mohammed, a long-term resident of Ifo camp who came as a child in 1992 and whose five children were all born here and have never left.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e33819fc2f43c307b6a37da07099326a8bd69a7c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/13/1421162697505/4d79a36c-e8bb-4f55-becb-8189c1873558-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Somalis fleeing war and famine in 2011 to seek refuge in Dadaab.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Somalis fleeing war and famine in 2011 to seek refuge in Dadaab.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Refugees are supposed to be offered one of three durable solutions to their displacement: return to their country of origin, integration into their country of asylum, or resettlement to a third country. Kenya, however, is unwilling to grant the refugees citizenship, even seeking to impose a new security bill this month with a clause limiting the amount of time refugees can stay. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/16/campaign-refugee-resettlement-europe\">resettlement slots to the US and Europe have all but dried up</a>, falling from thousands a year in the 90s, to a few hundred now.<br /></p> <p>Feeding people whom the world has confined to camps is an obligation under international law, but as donors tire of protracted refugee situations such as Dadaab, budgets begin to fall.

She was not impressed. “No schools, no hospitals, no security,” she reported back to her constituents. Nonetheless, more people are signing up for the return package, which includes three months of rations and a cash grant of $150 (£99) a person. For Mohammed, raised in the camp, Somalia is a foreign country, and a scary one at that. “I fear that place,” he said. “But if the food stops, there is no reason to stay in the camp.”<br /></p> <p>From one perspective, the picture of those buses bouncing across the no man’s land could be a good news story.

The flower business is a lucrative one, worth more than €10bn (£7.7bn) worldwide every year, and Kenya is one of the world’s largest exporters of cut stems. So it was a crushing blow when <a href=\"http://www.smartkenya.co.uk/kenya-misses-eu-deadline-on-exports/\">Europe imposed tariffs on Kenya’s cut flowers</a> in October last year, potentially making their blooms significantly more expensive than those grown on European soil. Rather than risk losing trade to other suppliers, Kenyan flower companies absorbed the duties. In the three months they were in place, the Kenya Flower Council estimates that its exporters racked up costs of about €3m (£2.3m).</p> <p>Kenya was being punished for failing to sign a new trade agreement. As the cut flower industry started to feel the pain, Nairobi snapped and signed on the dotted line. The <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/kenyaNews/idAFL1N0U80B620141224\">EU removed the duties on Christmas Day</a>, meaning Kenya’s flower exporters have a clean run up to Valentine’s Day. Lodewijk Briet, the EU’s ambassador to Kenya, said in a statement that the EU had “fast-tracked” approval of the deal and called it a “Christmas gift for Kenyan exporters”.</p> <p>While the flower industry is breathing a sigh of relief, many observers fear that the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) signed by the east African countries will be damaging in the long term. The EPA forces African countries to open 80% of their markets to European imports. In exchange, African states receive customs-free access to the European market.</p> <p>The deal, however, is skewed by other arrangements already in place. Liz May, head of policy at <a href=\"http://www.traidcraft.co.uk/\">Traidcraft</a>, explains: “There’s really nothing in it for east Africa.” She says most east African countries already have duty-free and quota-free access to the EU under the Everything But Arms agreement, so they have nothing to gain. “It’s putting Kenya in a situation of forcing its partners to sign up to something they were not in favour of.”</p> <p>Worried that their domestic markets would be flooded with European goods, many African countries resisted the EPA. May says: “EU imports could compete with domestic industries [such as] dairy, agriculture; those products from Europe could be subsidised in different ways at the European end.”</p> <p>There are major concerns that this agreement would, in fact, stand in the way of development. Andrew Mold, the UN’s economic analyst for east Africa, has said: “<a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/sections/development-policy/eu-africa-free-trade-agreement-destroys-development-policy-says-merkel\">African countries cannot compete with an economy like Germany’s</a>. As a result, free trade and EU imports endanger existing industries, and future industries do not even materialise because they are exposed to competition from the EU.”</p> <p>This is not the only situation when Europe appears to be undoing development work with a trade deal, says May. “There are lots of examples of incoherence between the European Commission’s development policy and its trade policies.” She cites the example of the Namibian beef industry. “During the course of the negotiations [for an EPA], the EU have given in aid all kinds of support to the Namibian beef sector to enable it to develop and thrive.” When Namibia refused to sign, the <a href=\"http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category/features/88636\">EU threatened to end its duty-free access to Europe</a>, effectively closing those markets to the country’s beef exports.</p> <p>Proponents say EPAs strengthen African markets and give them an opportunity to catch up with Europe. What’s more, under World Trade Organisation rules, the EU was obliged to broker a new trade agreement with east Africa and was running out of time to do so. Negotiations over the EPA had been going on for more than 10 years and there is a suggestion that the imposition of duties came out of frustration with the lack of progress. Sylvie Mamias, secretary- general of the international flower trade association, the <a href=\"http://www.unionfleurs.org/php/index.php\">Union Fleurs</a>, says: “I know from direct contact with the negotiators it was never the intention of the EU to have to impose duties. It was fair in the sense that they were in a negotiating process. The game was clear for everyone. There was a clear deadline.”</p> <p>Keller, the German MEP, says there were, however, other options; such as renegotiating the EPA, or implementing an actual partnership agreement. “EPAs are not partnership agreements. They are free-trade deals and therefore they go completely against the development logic that had been prevailing in our relationship with those countries.”</p> <p><strong>Read more like this:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/14/fall-price-milk-dairy-farmers-out-business\">Fall in price of milk ‘could force dairy farmers out of business’</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/13/small-miners-jewellery-supply-chain\">Can consumer power make space for small miners in the jewellery supply chain?</a></li> <li><strong>Brought to you by the Fairtrade Foundation: </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/fairtrade-partner-zone/2014/nov/28/south-south-trade-is-creating-a-new-path-for-fairtrade-in-south-africa\">South-south trade is creating a new path for Fairtrade in South Africa</a></li> </ul> <p><em>The </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/supply-chain\"><em>supply chain hub</em></a><em> is sponsored by the Fairtrade Foundation.

The $1.8bn construction project, which is 90% complete, will start limited power generation in June.<br /></p> <p>The downstream impact of the dam is hotly contested. Some hydrologists have predicted that Ethiopia’s <a href=\"http://www.oaklandinstitute.org/sites/oaklandinstitute.org/files/OI_Brief_Ignoring_Abuse_Ethiopia_0.pdf\">expansion of water-intensive sugar and cotton plantations on the Omo river</a>, which the Gibe 111 dam allows, could reduce flow to Lake Turkana by up to 70%.

A spokeswoman said: “The dam will provide a regular flow of water to Lake Turkana, which gives the possibility of providing a water supply throughout the year, whereas the lake is currently short of water in the dry season. The regular flow of water will also improve the aquatic life of Lake Turkana, providing a better livelihood for people living round the lake.<br /></p> <p>“The project … is instrumental in forging regional integration – the Gibe III dam will have a role in the realisation of close economic cooperation between Ethiopia, Kenya and the countries beyond.

We pass a huge barn where the ostrich hens brood their eggs for 42 days – twice the length of incubating chicken eggs. They lay 20-25 eggs a month over a six-month period. We don't disturb them, but examine two eggs on display – one is empty for tourists to buy, the other weighing about 1.5kg could make a very large omelette.</p><p>Ostriches with mottled plumage stride around large pens. These youngsters are ready for the Nairobi market. Any bird more than eight months old would be too tough – though they can be used for breeding or for making feather dusters, wallets and bags.</p><p>After a year males, females and youngsters become distinct. The males turn black, the young are mottled and so are the females – but bigger. The ostriches don't roam free in the fields snacking around, in case lions have the same idea. No, they are in grass runs. In one, a black cock ostrich is turning from pink to red. He has the same idea as a female who advances towards him, feathers spread open and shimmering. Inexplicably he walks off in the opposite direction.</p><p><a href=\"http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/ostrich/\" title=\"\">Ostriches can run at 65km/h</a> and for speed are second only to the cheetah. However, their brains weigh only around 40g. This could account for them burying their heads in the sand, leaving the rest of their body exposed when lions or other predators are looking for lunch.</p><p>One area of the farm is given over to growing sweetcorn. The crop is huge: each sturdy stalk carries a huge corncob. The produce feeds the staff, who also grind some up with grass seed and feed it to the ostriches each morning.</p><p>The special excitement for us is ostrich riding and (for some of us) ostrich cutlets for lunch. One huge male ostrich already saddled – but not bridled – runs round in circles in an open-air&nbsp;arena. His huge pink legs end in just two powerful though somewhat spooky toes.</p><p>We learn this is the only ostrich farm in Kenya, but it does have Somali ostriches too. These are smaller and have blue skin as opposed to the Kenyan pink. A keeper goes off to rustle up a Somali ostrich for each of us to ride because none of us weighs more than 70kg. If we did, it would have been the pink one still enthusiastically circumnavigating the riding ring. Sophia, Jeremy and I (one at a time) are lifted aboard the ostrich, whose energy is held in check by two other keepers: ostriches are strong and wilful. I envisage holding on around the grey-feathered neck, but no, there is a small handle on the pommel of the fabric saddle and I hang on to that.</p><p>Curiously, the usually omnivorous Sophia cannot bear to eat someone she now knows socially. Jeremy has no such hang-ups and scours the menu for the largest ostrich steak he can find. Fortunately for my credit card, whole legs are not on offer. But the waiter tells us there is not one ostrich dish. I wonder if they have turned over a new leaf, but then he explains: \"Next time, order in advance, then we'll slaughter one for you.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em> regularly publishes a </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/letter-from\" title=\"\">Letter from</a><em> one of its readers from around the world.

The catch, of course, is that it wears out. Thanks to its bulky nature and combination of different materials, which makes recycling tricky, it adds huge volumes to landfills. <a href=\"https://carpetrecovery.org/\">Carpet America Recovery Effort</a> (Care) estimates that <a href=\"https://carpetrecovery.org/newsblog/newsletters/care-quarterly-newsletter-march-2005/\">5bn tonnes of carpet</a> – almost 1 tonne per person on the globe – ends up in landfill each year.

For the past several months, carpets have found a highly unconventional second life as bikes. Jenny McIver and her husband Rich – New Zealanders who have recently returned home after several years in New York City – run <a href=\"http://www.wishbonedesign.com/\">Wishbone Design</a>, a product design company. Together they have developed a technology that allows them to turn carpets into rigid tubular shapes and so form children’s bikes. Not just that: the Wishbone Bike Recycled Edition can be expanded as the child grows, saving additional space in landfill.</p> <p>“The nylon carpet fibres are shaved from the backing,” explains McIver. “Then both the nylon fibre and polypropylene backing are separately recycled via a proprietary process, which shreds, cleans and heats the raw material into liquid form. We add glass fibre for strength and rigidity.”<br /></p> <p>The result is engineered resin pellets that can be injection-moulded into strong organic forms. “But we don’t stop there,” says McIver. “This is the first bicycle ever to be made using gas-assisted injection moulding, which allows us to create complex, single-piece tubular forms that achieve very high strength and rigidity.”</p> <p>The couple spent almost three years developing the technology and design, introducing the mass-produced bike last year – the world’s first bike made entirely from post-consumer recycled material. In concrete terms, that means nylon from used carpet – two kilos of it per bike. Customers particularly love the design aesthetic and the adjustable frame, says McIver, which fits children from 12 months to six years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/16/berlin-duo-supermarket-no-packaging-food-waste\">Berlin duo launch a supermarket with no packaging</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Wishbone Bike Recycled Edition may be the most glamorous end for a worn-out floor covering, but it is not the only way to recycle a carpet. Particularly in the US, carpet recycling is advancing quickly. Thanks to Care, a partnership between the government and private companies, <a href=\"http://carpetrecoveryeffort.blogspot.co.uk/2013_08_01_archive.html\">30% of used carpet now returns to the market as carpet fibre, backings, new carpet, cushions and engineered resins</a>, a common component in durable goods. Care reports that in 2012, the latest year surveyed, 1.6m tonnes of carpet was diverted from American landfills and recycled, the highest figure ever.</p> <p>In the Netherlands, meanwhile, carpet giant <a href=\"http://www.desso.com/\">Desso</a> has a different approach to diverting carpet from landfill. Partnering with Dutch drinking-water companies, Desso has developed a pioneering technology that extracts chalk from water that can then be used as a stabiliser in Desso’s carpet tile backing. Desso’s <a href=\"http://www.desso.co.uk/news-events/news-overview/2014/11/cradle-to-cradler-carpet-company-desso-launches-new-circular-economy-material-stream-of-up-to-20000-tonnes-of-chalk-from-local-water-companies/\">EcoBase backing</a> now contains on average 50% recycled content and can be recycled in Desso’s own production. A cradle-to-cradle carpet, as it were.</p> <p>“The backing that is more commonly used is made from oil-residue material, but that material isn’t easily recyclable due to an inconsistent material composition,” says Anette Timmer, Desso’s communications director. “When disassembling carpet tiles as we do within our plant, it’s key to regain the pure material streams, which makes it more economically viable for use in the new life cycle.”</p> <p>The problem is that recycling carpet costs money. Care warns would-be recyclers that they can’t just leave their rugs outside for collection. Transporting carpet is expensive and so is the complicated procedure of separating its components. If Desso carpet and Wishbone bikes are to become commonplace, consumers have to be ready to pay to have their carpet transported away, even when it’s much easier to put it in the bin. At the same time, while recycling rates have now reached an impressive <a href=\"http://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/highest-recycling-rates-in-austria\">63% in Austria, 62% in Germany and 58% in Belgium, the EU average remains at 39%</a>. If members states are to reach the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/framework/\">50% recycling target by 2020</a>, they’d do well to facilitate easier salvaging of the bulky carpet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/05/house-video-cassettes-jeans-toothbrushes-waste-brighton-circular-economy\">The house made from 4,000 video cassettes and two tonnes of jeans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For her part, Jenny McIver believes there are plenty of second carpet lives waiting to be discovered.

The women marched from the high court to Uhuru Park with T-shirts that said: “Enforced and coerced sterilisation of women living with HIV”.</p> <p>Lawyer Allan Maleche <a href=\"http://kelinkenya.org/news\">said his five clients</a> were sterilised in health facilities in Nairobi county through a procedure known as bilateral tubal ligation. The various circumstances allegedly included: threats to withhold food portions and baby formula milk; inducement with the promise to pay medical and maternity fees; lack of provision of essential information to enable the women to make informed decisions; lack of provision of choices of other forms of family planning methods for the women.</p> <p>Maleche said that one of the women was given two discount vouchers to reduce the cost of delivering her baby in hospital: one was for a caesarian but she did not realise the other was for tubal ligation.</p> <p>“They have been psychologically affected, they have found it difficult when their spouse has left them for another spouse who can have more children,” the lawyer said on Thursday. “There is depression because something so valuable in their lives had been taken away from them. Their spouses wanted more children.”</p> <p>MSF and Marie Stopes International did not directly carry out sterilisations, Maleche added, but allegedly referred the women to government hospitals where the operations were performed.</p> <p>The lawsuit asks the court to make declarations including “the sterilisation of these women in these circumstances violated their human and constitutional rights” and “women living with HIV have equal reproductive health rights as all women including the right to freely and voluntarily determine if, when and how often to bear children”.</p> <p>One of the group, Teresia Otieno, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30417266\">told the BBC</a>: “I went in for an operation to give birth to my first child. By the time I was leaving the operation the doctor told me I had been sterilised.”</p> <p> MSF said it had never encouraged surgical sterilisation as a preferred contraceptive method. Bilateral tube ligation was one contraceptive measure described to patients. <br /></p> <p>Dr Alexandra Vandenbulcke, MSF’s medical coordinator in Nairobi, said: “MSF takes these allegations extremely seriously and is reviewing them carefully. As a medical humanitarian aid organisation, MSF is committed to ensuring that all of our patients are fully informed about their medical options and that all of our patients provide full and informed consent prior to any medical treatment they receive.” <br /></p> <p>Faustina Fynn-Nyame, country director of Marie Stopes Kenya, said: “We are currently investigating the stories, but would be deeply concerned about any possibility that any woman had the kind of experience outlined in the report while under our care. <br /></p> <p> “If the accounts are accurate, they are wholly inconsistent with our principles of voluntarism, informed choice, and informed consent which are fundamental to our values, policies, and practices in all of the 38 countries we work in around the world. <br /></p> <p>“We will be working with government, private and NGO family planning providers in Kenya to determine the facts of these historical claims, and to reinforce our shared commitment to informed choice and informed consent.”</p> <p>In 2012, <a href=\"http://gem.or.ke/robbed-of-choice\">a landmark report entitled Robbed of Choice</a>, produced by the African Gender and Media Initiative, contained powerful testimonies from 40 Kenyan women who said they had been affected. Its author, Faith Kasiva, described the forcible and coerced sterilisation of poor, HIV-positive women as “systemic in public health facilities”.</p> <p>She <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/item/?map=hiv-positive-kenyan-women-plan-to-sue-over-sterilisation\">told TrustLaw</a>: “We live in an African cultural setting where having a child or motherhood is glorified in a way that probably it’s not in other societies. A lot of these women, because they cannot give birth, they have been chased away from their homesteads. Others have been disinherited.”</p> <p>The report quoted Selina, a 23-year-old woman, who said she was admitted to the Kenyatta national hospital in 2000 with tuberculosis and pre-term labour pains. She told how she underwent a caesarean section and, in the process, was sterilised after her husband signed the consent forms without her knowledge.</p> <p>Her husband sent her away and married another woman because he “could not live with a woman who cannot give birth”, she was quoted as saying. “The sterilisation ruined my life.”</p> <p>The women’s campaign received a boost in 2012 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/30/namibia-hiv-women-sterilised-without-consent\">when a court in Namibia ruled</a> that state hospitals illegally sterilised three HIV-positive women.

All eyes are on the dusty church floor, silent and respectful. When Muthee, chairman of Double K, began his speech, wearing a dark suit and a warm smile despite the intense heat, his companions could easily anticipate the story he would tell. Like a broken record, his story is familiar to many farmers in Nanyuki, on the emerald green foothills of Mount Kenya in the central part of the country.</p><p>It often starts with poor soil conditions or bad seeds, devastating pests and diseases, and extreme weather. If the farmers produce a yield worth selling, issues might arise about transport, particularly where road conditions are poor. Lack of available markets or buyers on the other end is also problematic. The story ends with severe debts owed to banks, suppliers of necessities like fertilisers, and even to the schools that the village children must leave when their parents cannot pay the tuition fees.</p><p>\"The farmers had started losing hope,\" says Muthee, whose story features all of the above. Today, however, a visit from the Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture (SFSA) has caused a stir. SFSA has previously conducted a soil test on Double K land to help farmers better understand which fertiliser to use, so the organisation is liked and trusted by the farmers.</p><p>SFSA has given hope to farmers such as those in the Double K group. Its aims – to work with smallholder farmers to solve their farming problems and improve their livelihoods – are achieved primarily through the development of technology and education. It also forms partnerships with local smallholder farming groups and suppliers to achieve these goals.</p><p>One such supplier is Sunrise Agrovet, a shop in Nanyuki so colourful that, despite the clouds of dust kicked up by the traffic, you can see it from far away. Inside, Lucy Kabatha is sorting through packets of fertiliser. \"They love this one,\" she says, holding out a small packet. \"Everyone can afford it.\" The letters NPK are scattered here and there across boxes and bags. NPK stands for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, the main chemical components of fertiliser. Kabatha believes that through the development of technology, \"farmers can improve themselves, they can educate their kids, they can be [financially] stable, no matter what.\"</p><p>Research shows that the average distance between Kenyan farmers and their nearest fertiliser seller halved between 1997 and 2007, making fertiliser much more accessible. Crops often take longer than average to grow in high-altitude regions such as Nanyuki, so fertilisers that reduce the time taken from planting the seed to harvesting the crop are a blessing.</p><p>The boys at Thome secondary school are learning to solve the kind of problems faced by farmers. The school was founded by Samuel Mweri, who houses and educates destitute children. The boys attend standard classes as well as being taught how to manage the small farm, or shamba, that surrounds the school. They grow vegetables for their own consumption and keep animals. \"They are very smart,\" says Mweri, who is planning to have the greenhouse roof repaired after strong winds blew it apart. The crops inside the greenhouse, immaculate and well watered, are a testament to the children's farming skills as well as to people such as Mweri who dedicate their time and resources to development projects.</p><p>For many farmers, however, farming fruit and vegetables purely for sustenance does not offer a secure future, and selling their produce is the only option. Some choose to sell on the streets, which can involve long and expensive journeys to the nearest town. Others, such as Moses Mugambi, sell to exporters. Mugambi, chairman of the Lenana self-help group, a local farmer's collective, grows fine beans using natural fertiliser from farm animal manure, which he sells to Kenya Horticultural Exporters (KHE). Not only is using animal manure more cost-effective, but selling to exporters, who generally come to collect the produce themselves, means no travel costs are incurred, so Mugambi's farm is relatively efficient. The problems, however, do not end with the exporters.</p><p>KHE has to deal with stringent regulations imposed on exported goods. For example, beans have to meet certain specifications before they are packed by exporting companies to determine whether they are suitable for sale.</p><p>UK supermarkets typically have the most severe specifications, which result in up to 40% of produce being thrown away at the packing houses. It might fail to meet the required length – often by only a small margin – or be the \"wrong\" angle, weight or texture. In a country where the World Bank estimates 46% of the population lives below the poverty line, one could be forgiven for thinking that such wasteful and damaging policies might be on their way out, but sadly this is not the case.</p><p><strong>Hungry baboons</strong></p><p>Dean Summerton, general manager at KHE, has found a clever use for the excess produce. On the other side of the packing house and surrounding farmland lives a troop of baboons. Initially the baboons had caused problems, attempting to take produce from KHE land, and it was thought they would have to be killed. Instead, rejected produce is dumped on a plot of land near the farm. The baboons congregate there and, being satisfied with their feed, do not disturb the KHE farmers or packing house.</p><p>\"The future of Kenya is not about the big commercial farms,\" says Summerton, adding that, if they work together, smallholder farmers could produce more yield than commercial farmers. SFSA has 12 registered farmers' groups and is hoping to facilitate communications between them.</p><p>On the long road between Nanyuki and Nairobi, a crowd is kicking up dust on the roadside. The people are here to collect relief food, water, and medicine. As we drive on, it is hard not to think about Moses Mugambi, his 1990 Comic Relief T-shirt strikingly white against the black soil of his newly harvested maize plantation. A&nbsp;procession of NGOs has passed through Kenya in recent decades, but the country needs assistance that will encourage productivity, not dependency. How long until someone acts to end the absurdity of feeding a&nbsp;country that is hungry to feed itself?</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/journalismcompetition/kenya-farmers-save-livelihoods","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/journalismcompetition/kenya-farmers-save-livelihoods","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"Al-Shabaab militants kill 36 Christian quarry workers in Kenya","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-02T12:51:47Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2014/dec/02/kenya-quarry-massacre-leaves-36-dead-says-red-cross","fields":{"body":"<p>Militants from the Somalia-based al-Shabaab terror group have killed 36 mainly Christian quarry workers, intensifying security fears in much of Kenya’s north.</p> <p>Witnesses said the attackers surrounded the camp in a remote district near the Somali border shortly after midnight on Tuesday, roused the sleeping workers and ordered those who could not prove they were Muslims to lie on the ground before spraying them with bullets.<br /></p> <p>It was the second such massacre in recent weeks.

This extension of the conversation beyond the experts is a seismic shift that has registered across the creative industries from media – where the readers become the creators – to theatre, where the audience become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/jul/29/tech-talk-bertie-watkins-colab-theatre\">part of the production</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4b61ac76-bbcf-4748-b558-10d3bf85d284\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/31/1414754593869/171a52c2-9c13-4e4b-a739-0cead7f65622-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dick Penny\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dick Penny: ‘there is a library of culture that is readily available to young people.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Malyon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/2014/feb/18/interview-dick-penny-watershed-bristol\">Dick Penny</a>, director of Watershed, a cross-artform venue and producer based in Bristol, says: “technology allows people to choose between a more traditional, passive experience and a more active, participatory interaction … it’s amazing how regimented we have become in our cultural habits. Take theatre for example: you buy your ticket, have a drink, find your seat, sit, the lights go down, you know it’s time to be silent. Companies such as [immersive theatre pioneers] <a href=\"http://punchdrunk.com/\">Punchdrunk</a> have turned those conceits on their head. Rather than devaluing the traditional approach, it just shows there is another way of doing it.”</p> <h2>Opportunities and threats</h2> <p>Another significant change is the freeing up of the means of production. It has never been easier to at least attempt to make your creative dreams come true. Shrinking costs have created a wealth of opportunity, but sometimes it’s hard to convey that sense of excitement to those at the top of traditional media industries. One constant thread throughout my own career as a journalist has been the sometimes thankless task of educating print hacks about the possibilities of digital.</p> <p>Where you see an opportunity, your superiors all too often see a threat. The idea that the audience has gained control of the conversation, or at least has the opportunity to influence it through comments and clicks, is anathema to traditional editors convinced of the superiority of their own curatorial decisions. “But, we’re the experts,” they splutter, while projects such as <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Witness</a> empower thousands of users to document real world events in real-time, seamlessly blending the newspaper experience with the digital experience. This is storytelling in the modern age: immersive, engaging and immediate.</p> <p>The digital audience is more fickle: we have multiple subscriptions to magazines and newspapers; we leave a spray of comments on different websites. But that just means titles have to work harder on getting and keeping readers, with subscriber benefits, content extras and a sense of added value. What’s fascinating is the speed at which digital media insurgents such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/vicenews\">Vice</a> – which began as a provocative pop culture magazine and is now famed for its youth-focused video output with more than 150m monthly users – are becoming part of the media establishment. Vice was named media company of the year at the 2014 British Media Awards, with the judges citing its ability to “disprove the myth that digital content needs to be short-form or throwaway to be successful.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMtz1xobvn4\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMtz1xobvn4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>This year’s teaser trailer for Vice news</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Creating a broader context</h2> <p>As the YouTube generation matures, their hunger for hard news is proving just as healthy as that of their pre-internet parents. The only thing to have changed is the method of delivery and the ability of the audience to join the debate. As Vice’s co-founder Shane Smith <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/02/vice-media-shane-smith-north-korea\">told The Guardian</a>: “Young people, who are the majority of our audience, are angry, disenfranchised and they don’t like or trust mainstream media outlets. They’re leaving TV in droves, but music and news are the two things that Generation Y in every country are excited about and interested in.”</p> <p>It’s worth noting that technology has improved access to culture and in doing so, created a broader context. In terms of music – the industry perhaps most transformed by technology – this means that the opportunity for music junkies to indulge their obsessions has never been greater. “When I was growing up, all that was available to me was the local record shop or the odd radio show,” says Penny. “My son has just started university and his attitude to culture is completely different. He has grown up with access to any music he chooses and has an encyclopaedic knowledge. If he finds a band he likes, he will trace all their influences and listen to all those bands too. There is a library of culture that is readily available to young people, which my generation just didn’t have.”</p> <p>But with this sense of cultural enrichment and depth comes a feeling of information overload and the need to filter out the noise. It’s this that has triggered the rise of the online curator, propelling bloggers and vloggers such as beauty queen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/zoella280390?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB\">Zoella</a>, 24, to internet stardom. With her first book, Girl Online, due out in November and an audience estimated to be 26 times that of the circulation of British Vogue, Zoella is a key example of what the advertising world call a “crowdsourced people’s champion” – one who earns hundreds of thousands of pounds a year and is paid by brands such as Unilever to connect with the ever-elusive 18-30 demographic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrOAVLICvhw\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CrOAVLICvhw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>YouTube vlogger Zoella reveals her everyday makeup routine</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Lessons for the arts</h2> <p>What can cultural organisations and mainstream media learn from these youthful tastemakers? Their rise is attributed to technological advances that enable interaction and accessibility – the increased importance of trust among digitally savvy consumers and the intimate connection that exists between vlogger and viewer. Ways that institutions can look to replicate that is through live-streaming events, behind-the-scenes video blogs and “masterclass” clips from big names associated with the venue or company.</p> <p>So has technology changed cultural taste? It’s clear that the way we consume, create and think about culture is constantly evolving, as it has throughout history. New forms of media always spark some moral and intellectual panics. The printing press, newspapers, paperbacks and television were all once denounced as threats to consumers’ brainpower and moral fibre. </p> <p>It’s not technology shaping taste, but the human desire to connect, share and evaluate culture. Technology provides the tools but it is still society that shapes taste.</p> <p>S<em>erena Kutchinsky (</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SKutchinsky\"><em>@SKutchinsky</em></a><em>) is digital editor of </em><a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/\"><em>Prospect Magazine</em></a><em> and will be taking part in a session at <a href=\"http://www.sagegateshead.com/tour-dates/bbc-radio-3-free-thinking-festival-of-ideas\">BBC Radio 3’s Free Thinking Festival</a>, which takes place from 31 October to 2 November</em></p> <h2>More like this</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/2014/feb/18/interview-dick-penny-watershed-bristol\">Arts head: Dick Penny, managing director, Watershed</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/oct/14/youtube-arts-tips-experts-webchat\">YouTube for the arts: expert tips</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/oct/03/post-web-technology-museums-virtual-reality\">Post-web tech: what comes next for museums?</a></p> <p><strong>Join our community of arts, culture and creative professionals by signing up free to the </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/culture-professionals/register/\"><strong>Guardian Culture Pros Network</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/2014/oct/31/-sp-technology-cultural-taste-youtube-vloggers-vice","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture-professionals-network/2014/oct/31/-sp-technology-cultural-taste-youtube-vloggers-vice","sectionName":"Culture professionals network"},{"webTitle":"Win an iPad mini  ","webPublicationDate":"2013-04-07T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/competition/2013/apr/08/whsmith-ipadmini-competition","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/competition/2013/apr/08/whsmith-ipadmini-competition","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/competition/2013/apr/08/whsmith-ipadmini-competition","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Technology to entertain in style","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-27T14:46:03Z","sectionId":"duracell-power-me","id":"duracell-power-me/2014/oct/27/technology-to-entertain-in-style","fields":{"body":"<p>The technology revolution has transformed our lives. Nowadays, we work while we commute, watch Breaking Bad on our phones, and smartphones have turned us all into photographers. But while improved technology has made life simpler – it hasn’t made deciding what sort of gadgets to invest in an easy decision. <br />With a bewildering array of options available, the science behind these products can sometimes blind consumers as to when it’s worth spending big, or whether to go for a bargain.<br />One very canny shopper is Ella Williamson, a gadget guru, writer and TV presenter who specialises in technology, and tries out pretty much every new gadget going. “In general terms, when it comes to technology you get what you pay for. But this applies not only in terms of quality but also functionality. When you are choosing a product, you need to think carefully about what you want, and what precisely you will be using it for. Invest in the features that are important to you,” she says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14db2e7eb83afae0e23f023d331ff9a26014bd2f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/2/1412269775552/d4dc1a86-33e7-4715-a827-d6d45bfdef87-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"Apple iPad on dock\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">iPads (from £249) are a great top-end tablet ideal for streaming.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Williamson cites tablets as a good example of this. “Tablets have really rocked everybody’s world, but if you want a family tablet that the kids are mostly going to use for playing games, then you don’t really need anything more sophisticated than the Tesco hudl, (£119). </p> <p>“But if you’re going to be using it more, or streaming it with other devices, than iPads (from £249) are great.”</p> <p>Williamson takes a similar view when it comes to home entertainment. “Really it’s all about matching content to the material. If you are seriously into films or gaming, then it’s worth spending on an ultra-HD telly, so you can stream your Netflix on to it, and reap that benefit.</p> <p>“And gaming consoles are just brilliant. They have come on so much from the stereotype of a teenage boy sitting in the dark playing an aggressive war game by himself. Something like the Xbox One is amazing – you can watch Orange is the New Black on Blu-ray, use Kinect for control-less gaming, surf the Internet or exercise. Xbox costs about £349.99, and I think its well worth investing in for its multi-functionality.” <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9acf2c6e0d4ab89ca42734dab1951d668cab72e7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/2/1412269999224/36b2656f-ce85-43e9-8519-8d269006861c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Xbox one with controllers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At £349.99 the Xbox One isn’t cheap, but it’s a worthwhile investment.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are some areas where Williamson does think it’s worth making a saving. “With HDMI, it is the tech at the end of the cable that does the hard data transfer work, for instance if you want to plug your iPhone into your telly. But I don’t think you need to spend a lot – I would recommend the John Lewis High Speed HDMI Cable, (3D Compatible, 2m). It’s £24.95. You could easily spend £100 on cables, but I just don’t think you need to.”<br />But when it comes to protecting your gadgets – Williamson thinks it wise to fork out. “There is a debate about paid-for versus free anti-virus software. Personally, I think it is worth paying for. Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2014 has been very highly reviewed – the great thing is it is all streamlined, so you get anti spam, anti virus, firewall and anti-spyware – combined in what they call a suite. Now of course you could get that all for free separately, but it would be so much more of a hassle. At around £14 for single use, going up to £49.99 for multi-users, I think it is well worth it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d77d73ff2919ad8c367eec275ada9e4b3015d6bb\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/3/1412328228855/a80ca4b1-8737-4464-aa99-30610c51e8c8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"John Lewis HDMI cables\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The John Lewis High Speed HDMI Cable (£24.95) is quality.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But most of all, Williamson reminds us that technology should be fun as well as useful. “There are some great things coming out. The 3Doodler 3D-printing pen is a fabulous introduction to 3D printing, which has a huge buzz about it. And I love MiP, the gesture-controlled robot you can guide around with your hand. You can make him dance, and if you have two you can even make them fight. He’s battery powered, and I would always recommend using a good quality battery like Duracell, so you’re not always having to replenish your supply. You can have hours of fun with it – and it’s a real talking point. And at £99.99, he’s a great example of how robotics have come down in price – making them accessible to ordinary consumers.”</p> <h2><strong>If you buy one thing</strong><br /></h2> <p>Now smartphones come with high resolution cameras as standard, taking pictures has never been easier, but if you want to make sure you do them justice when showing them to family and friends, invest in a battery-powered PocketCinema DLP V150W Pico Projector with Wi-Fi (from £275). Williamson says: “These are great because you can do your own show of wedding photos, or holiday pics. Rather than huddling round a laptop or smartphone you can project stills or films on to a wall. <br />They are highly portable as well, so they’re also invaluable in the workplace.” The projector can also stream videos, web pages, or documents so sharing the fun is even easier.<br /></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/duracell-power-me/2014/oct/27/technology-to-entertain-in-style","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/duracell-power-me/2014/oct/27/technology-to-entertain-in-style","sectionName":"Duracell Power Me"},{"webTitle":"Fights break out in Kenyan parliament over controversial anti-terrorism laws","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-18T17:50:27Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2014/dec/18/fights-kenya-parliament-anti-terrorism-laws","fields":{"body":"<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/dec/18/kenya-parliament-scuffles-anti-terror-bill-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/44apm\"                                data-video-id=\"2212483\"                data-video-name=\"Kenyan MPs scuffle in parliament over anti-terror bill - video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/12/18/1418923451785/crop_KP-57024_640.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-453695552\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/12/18/1418923449197/crop_KP-57024_1200.jpeg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/12/18/141218KenyaScuffles_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/12/18/141218KenyaScuffles_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/12/18/141218KenyaScuffles_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/12/18/141218KenyaScuffles.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/12/18/141218KenyaScuffles_small.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Scuffles break out in Kenya’s parliament in Nairobi</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fistfights and scuffles broke out in the Kenyan parliament on Thursday as members approved sweeping anti-terrorism laws that rights activists warn pose a draconian threat to civil liberties and freedom of speech.</p> <p>The parliamentary speaker, Justin Muturi, was pelted with books, documents and other objects by opposition MPs as emotions ran high over the bill, while on the streets of Nairobi police fired warning shots and eight demonstrators were reportedly arrested.</p> <p>The president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has claimed that the legislation is needed to tighten national security and combat Islamist militants responsible for last year’s Westgate shopping mall siege and more recent massacres. But critics say the government is exploiting fear of terrorism as a pretext for cracking down on dissent in civil society and the media. They argue that existing laws are sufficient and the true scourge is corruption within the police.</p> <p>“It’s not an anti-terror bill, it’s an anti-media, anti-activist, anti-citizens bill,” said <a href=\"http://www.bonifacemwangi.com\">Boniface Mwangi</a>, an activist and photographer who fears he will be a target. “They can arrest me without evidence or a warrant. We are going back to the days of dictatorship.”</p> <p>The stakes are high in east Africa’s biggest economy. Kenya is widely seen as a beacon of freedom and democracy but could be tempted to emulate regional models such as Ethiopia, Rwanda, Sudan and Uganda, where civil liberties have arguably been sacrificed in the name of security. Ethiopia has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/-sp-ethiopia-30-years-famine-human-rights\">little political freedom and imprisons more journalists than almost any country in Africa</a>; it has also suffered far fewer terrorist attacks than Kenya despite fighting alongside it in Somalia.</p> <p>Kenyatta’s government has been under pressure since last year’s attack by the extremist group al-Shabaab <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/westgate-mall-attacks-kenya-terror\">on the Westgate mall in Nairobi</a>, in which 67 people were killed. Earlier this month the interior minister and police chief were fired after al-Shabaab murdered 64 people in two attacks in the north-eastern Mandera region.</p> <p>The bill includes proposals extending the time police can hold terror suspects from the current 90 days to nearly a year, increasing sentences, and giving investigators more powers to tap phones. Landlords would be compelled to provide information about their tenants. Journalists could face up to three years behind bars if their reports “undermine investigations or security operations relating to terrorism,” or if they publish images of terror victims without permission from the police.</p> <p>Kenyatta, whose charges at the international criminal court were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/05/crimes-humanity-charges-kenya-president-dropped-uhuru-kenyatta\">recently dropped</a>, has said: “There is nothing to fear about the bill unless you have been engaging in criminal activities.”</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://mobile.nation.co.ke/blogs/We-must-not-go-back-to-era-of-oppression/-/1949942/2550500/-/format/xhtml/-/l8nawr/-/index.html\">an editorial in the Daily Nation newspaper contended</a>: “The very real and present dangers must not be used as an excuse to roll back the gains of a free and democratic society.”</p> <p>Many fear a return to the climate under president Daniel Arap Moi, who ruled from 1978 to 2002, when opposition parties were banned and dissenters silenced and jailed. Ababu Namwamba, an opposition MP, described the bill as a “return to the past … that we thought had been buried in the dustbin of history.”</p> <p>More recently Kenya has been seen as a crucial democratic bulwark in east Africa, with a vibrant media, a hub of international agencies and civil society organisations and a flourishing internet sector. Yet this week alone the government announced it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/16/kenya-ngo-crackdown-al-shabaab\">shutting down more than 500 non-government organisations</a> and influential blogger Robert Alai was charged with undermining the presidency after a tweet in which <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-30522356\">he called Kenyatta an “adolescent president”</a>.</p> <p>Matters reached a head in parliament on Thursday where MPs traded blows before TV cameras. Opposition members shouted, sang and shredded copies of the bill, warning that Kenya was becoming a police state. Government supporters hit and tore the clothes of an opposition senator in the public gallery. Amid the chaos the legislation eventually passed, with journalists barred from the vote and TV feeds discontinued.</p> <p>Campaigners said it defied the popular will. <a href=\"http://jmif.net/stories/story-of-ndungi-githuku\">Ndungi Githuku</a>, an artist and activist, said: “It is a draconian law that the majority of Kenyans are against. It means we are going back to the dark days when you could be arrested at any time and the police think you are a threat to national security. You cannot express yourself freely. You cannot sing a song that is a ‘threat’ to them. It’s like 1986 when people were thrown into torture chambers.”</p> <p>The threat of al-Shabaab should not be used as an excuse, he said. “I’ve got friends who died at Westgate but we really feel terrorism is being used as a ploy to control people. If we are able to tighten the loopholes of corruption we will have fewer people sneaking over the border or bribing cops.”</p> <p>The laws were also condemned by Abdullahi Boru, a Kenya analyst and researcher for Amnesty International. He said: “It speaks to the paranoia of the government when they can’t control the narrative. It’s not the media’s fault if the police are corrupt. The elephant in the room is Kenya’s lack of a plan regarding Somalia.</p> <p>“Kenya and Kenyatta are trying to model themselves on Rwanda, Uganda and Ethiopia, but all these three regimes are a function of the way they came to power. These are governments that were formed in the bush and are principally military governments. Kenyans need to be cognisant of that. There are better ways of fighting terrorism than rolling back the freedoms of the past 20 years.”</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/18/fights-kenya-parliament-anti-terrorism-laws","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/18/fights-kenya-parliament-anti-terrorism-laws","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"British athletes with altitude look to follow in Mo Farah’s footsteps","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-05T18:10:39Z","sectionId":"sport","id":"sport/2014/dec/05/british-athletes-altitude-mo-farah-kenya","fields":{"body":"<p>Shortly after a flaming dawn in Kenya’s Rift Valley, a bare-chested man is being stabbed in the ear in the name of scientific research. A family of curious, emaciated sheep plod by, straining to get a closer look. Charlie Grice doesn’t flinch as his blood is drained and stored. He knows the real pain lies ahead. For the next half-hour, Grice – one of Britain’s brightest 1500m hopes – and a dozen other elite athletes tackle a series of brutal hill repetitions: three minutes flat out, one minute easy; two minutes flat out, one minute easy; one minute flat out, one minute easy – all repeated three times.</p> <p>It may not sound that hard but the rocky, crimson-coloured road from the valley floor to Iten is so unrelentingly steep that even a 4x4 drive splutters and coughs while keeping up with the athletes, whose lungs struggle to grasp oxygen at 8,000ft. Towards the end of the session, every rep ends with heads on knees. Grice is not so lucky. He has to stand while Gareth Turner, the camp‑based physiologist, rushes out of a car and jabs another spring-loaded lancet in his ear. Grice’s blood samples will be assessed for their lactate levels to see how hard he was working. But his hangdog appearance tells you all you need to know. He is spent.</p> <p>As the group finishes, Turner turns to the cross-country runner Katie Brough and asks how she is feeling. In between hoarse gasps, she just about musters a response. “This is worse than childbirth – and you can quote me on that.”</p> <p>These athletes are involved in the first wave of Project Pinnacle, a new research partnership between British Athletics and the English Institute of Sport, which seeks to advance the understanding of altitude training. The aim is simple: create more British medallists at major championships. As Barry Fudge, the head of endurance at British Athletics, points out, Mo Farah’s golden achievements over the past three years are an obvious lodestar.</p> <p>“Mo’s success is down to a combination of a lot of factors, but altitude training is fundamental to what he does,” he says. “It was also a vehicle for him to understand what he had to do to be successful. Mo started comprehensive altitude training in 2010, and every year we have evolved it and changed it slightly to the point where we think we have cracked it.</p> <p>“But with other athletes we don’t want to take four years. We want to go: ‘Right, that’s what we do.’ That’s what the science is missing, the ability to predict what’s going to happen.”</p> <p>The benefits of altitude training have been known for decades: the lack of oxygen in the air forces the body to increase its red blood cell count, so when athletes return to sea level they usually find performance is improved for a short period. Typically, the more time you spend at altitude, the more you benefit.</p> <p>But Fudge and his team want to know more. So they are focusing on three research projects: assessing the optimal time to compete after altitude exposure; identifying if training intensity when tapering for a major event has a priming effect on performance; and analysing if you can predict in advance how long an athlete will take to adapt to altitude.</p> <p>Most athletes do not concern themselves with such cutting-edge science. For them, Kenya is about a simple and stark routine: eat, run, rest, repeat. No one questions whether it works. They see the evidence with their own eyes. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/09/david-rudisha-world-record-olympic-800m\">David Rudisha, the world 800m record holder</a>, trains in Iten. So do <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2014/sep/29/dennis-kimetto-breaks-the-world-marathon-record-in-berlin\">Dennis Kimetto, the world marathon record holder</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/13/mo-farah-eighth-london-marathon-wilson-kipsang-british-record\">Wilson Kipsang, the winner of this years’s London</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/02/wilson-kipsang-mary-keitany-win-new-york-marathon-kenya\">New York marathons</a>.</p> <p>Every time they visit, the British team base themselves at the High Altitude Training Centre. Outside there is a sign that says it is the “University of Champions”. It is no idle boast. But while its food is decent and the roads and trails around Iten are perfect for running, pretty much everything else is no-frills. Everyone does their own washing in sinks or buckets. The electricity in the camp is solar powered, so after two days of rain the hot water turns lukewarm. The bedrooms fit two single beds and not much else. There is no pharmacy in Iten so the British Athletics physio room doubles up as a one-stop chemist, with everything from Dioralyte sachets to Deep Heat.</p> <p>There are frequent power cuts, too. Sometimes they occur when athletes are on the treadmills and they find themselves flying off at high speed – a sight that is vaguely comic, as long as it happens to someone else. As Andrew Osagie, the 800m world indoor bronze medallist, puts it: “Coming from the western world the facilities are really basic but when you look around Iten you appreciate we are lucky.”</p> <p>Osagie, like everyone else, keeps coming back to Kenya because he knows that the simple programme – typically running twice a day as well as doing core, stretching, and strength and conditioning – works.</p> <p>Fudge says: “Our altitude camps run from November through to summer, and what we tend to see is athletes that go in November and again in January are massively ahead of where they would have been if they didn’t go. If you are a young 1500m runner and you start in Kenya in November at 6.30min mile-pace and you find it really hard because of the altitude, by the time you go again in January that 6.30 is easy.”</p> <p>The 800m runner Alison Leonard puts it more poetically. “It’s much harder to breathe out here,” she says. “But some of the hills have shrunk since I got here.”</p> <p>Training in Kenya is not all about altitude: it’s also about mental fortitude. When your pulse flies into the stratosphere on what is supposed to be an easy run, you have to retrain the brain to what is possible, which can be particularly hard when you are going at least a minute a mile slower than back home. It is even harder in the rare cases when an athletes’ body does not adapt to training at altitude.</p> <p>Hannah England, the 2011 world championship silver medallist in the 1500m, says: “The problem is that I’m one of those athletes you might call a non-responder. There is no escaping from simple genetics – out here it is whether you’re able to produce your own natural hormones and extra red blood cells. My body does not really respond to being at altitude. Most people’s bodies say: ‘Right, I’m here let’s throw red blood cells out like no tomorrow,’ but mine’s: ‘No.’ It just doesn’t do it.</p> <p>“But I still keep coming back because I get very fit off it. I might get sick, my heart rate will go through the roof – hitting 190 beats per minute – and the breathing is very laboured. But there are aspects I enjoy – the group atmosphere and my time in the gym.”</p> <p>England – along with Osagie – is among the senior members of the British camp. Farah would usually be here, but he has been given six weeks off by his coach, Alberto Salazar, after flogging his body over the past three years. Also there are promising youngsters, such as Grice, who are here to absorb the benefits of altitude training as early as possible and to learn from the established runners.</p> <p>It is, says Fudge, a key part of British Athletics’ strategy. “Not only do they get the aerobic conditioning and the fancy bits we talk about, but also four weeks with experienced professional athletes. That’s great for helping them understanding what they have to do to reach the top of the sport. You could be there having breakfast with Mo Farah for the next four weeks, understanding how he lives his life, what he does and how he trains.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Farah graphic\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1417788085514/Mo-Farrah.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Kyle Langford, the youngest athlete on the trip at 18, quickly vouches for Fudge. “It’s the perfect lifestyle for me,” he says. “I couldn’t really ask for anything more – training and making new bonds.”</p> <p>Langford, whose trip is funded because he is on the British Athletics futures programme, ran his first track race at 15 and he has got his 800m time down from 2min 02sec to 1:47 despite very little training. When Rudisha ran the fourth-fastest 600m in history in Birmingham in August, Langford was seventh – just over two seconds back. He is very much on the fast track to the top.</p> <p>Some less successful athletes have had to pay their own way. The 23‑year‑old Ben Coldray, a decent-but-no-more 1500m runner, financed the £1,500 trip through a mixture of babysitting, modelling, and being a Butler in the Buff, which involves dancing for hen parties for £40 an hour.</p> <p>In Kenya, however, he spends most of his time fending off Grice’s surges rather than tipsy ladies. It is Grice who leads the British athletes up the steep mountain and under the “Welcome to Iten – home of champions” sign at the end of their morning run, having averaged 5min 30sec a mile pace on the hard intervals.</p> <p>No sooner have the British athletes gathered their breath than it is lost again when they see Rudisha gliding down the mountain. Initially, he is not spotted. Then someone shouts “Rudisha” and there are loud cheers and pointed fingers. As he waves back, some boys start chasing after him. It vaguely resembles a scene from Rocky.</p> <p>It is supremely graceful sight – a perfect example of amazing genetics, hard work and altitude training. Fudge says: “I spent three or four years in Kenya doing my PhD, looking at genetics and training, and my feeling is that the Kenyans – and I include Mo in this as well – are sprinters with engines. Their engines come from multiple years at altitude and training and getting that aerobic adaption.</p> <p>“Mo is a 1500m runner who has got a fantastic engine, has multiple years of developing it. Rudisha is a 400m runner with an engine and lots of aerobic adaption and so on. That’s what altitude gives them.”</p> <p>Having lived with the Kenyans, could more British athletes start beating them? Fudge certainly hopes so. “The ones who are close to medalling, when they spend more time at altitude the benefits they get are humongous,” he says. It is not a word you will find in scientific journals but that’s OK. The man behind British Athletics’ endurance programme is far more concerned with what happens on the track.</p> <p><em>The British Athletics Endurance Programme is supported by London Marathon, English Institute of Sport, National Lottery, Nike and Polar</em></p> <h2>Runs, rehab and rice</h2> <p><strong>Andrew Osagie, the world indoor 800m bronze medallist, explains a typical day in camp</strong></p> <p><strong>8am</strong> Wake up. Some are up earlier but I’ve always been someone who goes to bed around midnight. I’ll grab a light breakfast straight away.</p> <p><strong>8.30am </strong>The athletes go to the team physiologist, Gareth Turner, for a flexibility test and also to fill in a questionnaire to assess how they are feeling. If someone is tired or irritable their training for the day will be eased back.</p> <p><strong>9am </strong>Most go for a run that can last anything from 45-90 minutes but I have been nursing an injury so I will do 50 minutes on the cross trainer and bike.</p> <p><strong>11.30am </strong>Rehab and drills. I will often have a circuit session that not only elevates my heart rate but works on strengthening my achilles tendon. Afterwards I will see the physio to make sure everything is in the right place.</p> <p><strong>12.30pm </strong>Lunch. The food here is organic, grown locally and pretty good. I grew up eating quite an African diet because my dad is from Nigeria, so I’m used to lots of rice and things like curried goat. For some of the other guys it was a bit of a shock.</p> <p><strong>1.30pm </strong>Chill time. Most people have a nap, either 30 minutes or 90 minutes but I don’t really sleep during the day. Instead I’ll speak to people at home, play some table tennis or the QuizUp app, or simply rest.</p> <p><strong>4pm </strong>Most will use the late afternoon to do a weights or core session. Some of the younger lads end the session with a bench-press challenge – it has nothing to do with helping them run faster, they’re just doing it for bragging rights.</p> <p><strong>5pm </strong>Some athletes will go for their second run of the day in the late afternoon. Usually it’s nothing too strenuous.</p> <p><strong>7pm </strong>Dinner.</p> <p><strong>8pm </strong>Play time. Sometimes we’ll watch television – you can watch more Premier League football in Kenya than in the UK – but just as often we’ll play on games consoles. My coach Craig Winrow brought his old Game Cube out so every one, boys and girls, have been playing Mario Kart.</p> <p><strong>Midnight </strong>Bed</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/05/british-athletes-altitude-mo-farah-kenya","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2014/dec/05/british-athletes-altitude-mo-farah-kenya","sectionName":"Sport"},{"webTitle":"Nairobi's 'miniskirt' march exposes sexual violence in Kenya","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-18T07:00:03Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2014/nov/18/nairobis-miniskirt-march-exposes-sexual-violence-in-kenya","fields":{"body":"<p>At the busy intersection of Accra Road and Tom Mboya Street in downtown Nairobi, a cacophony of voices clamour to be heard. Buses and vans vie for space on the roadside, and touts solicit passengers to ply their routes. Nearly everyone is on the move. </p> <p>Shortly after 12pm on 17 November, one noise superseded all the rest – that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/17/kenya-mydressmychoice-protest-woman-stripped\">more than 200 women</a>, plus a few men, marching, blowing whistles, chanting and yelling for their constitutional right to be protected from sexual violence, and to wear a miniskirt.</p> <p>Ten days ago, according to <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/oped/blogs/dot9/arunga/-/2274444/2520182/-/wfd820/-/index.html\">Kenyan media reports</a>, a woman wearing a red dress was stripped by a mob of men at this spot. They accused her of being inappropriately dressed. According to a driver and co-driver of a minibus who recall the assault, two men began it but others quickly joined in – “for fun”, the co-driver, Robert Ndungata, said. Driver Juguna Maina said he and others tried to stop them, but failed. “You can’t control the mob,” he said. </p> <p>A passer-by captured the attack on his mobile phone, and the video was posted on YouTube. It was one of a number of such incidents to play out on social media in recent months, but none had captured the public’s attention to such an extent. Twitter was ablaze with hashtags, some advocating for women to cover up rather than be #scantilydressed, others arguing #MyDressMyChoice. It quickly escalated into a debate about women’s rights. </p> <p>A link to the video was posted to a Facebook group, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/KilimaniMumsNairobi/\">Kilimani Mums Nairobi</a>, part of an online support network for mothers. On 12 November, a group of 10 Kilimani mums, connected only by social media, met for the first time. They decided it was their duty “to deliver a message to the touts who who stripped our sister that it is wrong and a woman has the right to dress the way she sees fit”, Kilimani mum Ruth Knaust wrote to members of the Facebook group. From this seed, the #MyDressMyChoice march was born. </p> <p>Sexual violence is widespread in Kenya. A 2010 <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unicef.org%2Fesaro%2FVAC_in_Kenya.pdf&amp;ei=XjpvVI6QLIfkavf7gZAF&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxlc5lWoJyY2rrviHjsBl9StFqCQ&amp;sig2=jJ872BlbpI75KLUvz5lyFA&amp;bvm=bv.80185997,d.d2s\">national survey</a> (pdf) indicated that 32% of girls experienced sexual violence before becoming adults. Being stripped in public is nothing new in Kenya, says Christopher Kirwa, who turned out to support the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MyDressMyChoice&amp;src=tyah\">#MyDressMyChoice</a> movement. In the early 1990s, there was a lot of stripping, he says. The difference now is that it is more visible and there is more awareness of it, due largely to social media.</p> <p>Kirwa, who owns an experimental marketing agency, was shocked when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertalai\">Robert Alai</a>, an influential Kenyan blogger, tweeted in support of forcibly undressing women. “There’s more to it than lack of education. On social media, there are ladies supporting what happened. The educated masses that are supporting it tells me we have a bigger problem,” he said.</p> <p>“Kenya is becoming more free, more liberal, more modernised, and there are people who are against that,” said Yvonne Kerre, the owner of a chain of clothing stores, Miss Kerre Fashions, that is thriving thanks to women becoming more expressive.<br />Some churches in Nairobi have spoken out against wearing short skirts, both at church and outside. Minibus touts in downtown Nairobi speak of an invisible line across the city, dividing where it’s acceptable to be seen in a short skirt, and where it’s not. The general consensus is that one inch above the knee is the limit. It’s clear that there is a strong, conservative core. </p> <p>Two women, a bus conductor and an inspector, working on the Embassava bus stand where the stripping incident allegedly happened, believe that any skirt above the knee is morally reprehensible, and that the woman in red, who was stripped here, was the one in the wrong. “If she’s raped, it’s her fault,” says Naomi Mang’era, the inspector, of any women who wear “micro-mini skirts”. “Our country should be like Uganda – short skirts should be banned,” says a male bus tout. The two women agree.</p> <p>“One has to locate this in the general discrimination against women, widespread stereotypes and chauvinistic tendencies of our society,” says Amnesty’s east Africa researcher, Japhet Biegon. There has been progress, he says; in 2006, Kenya enacted the Sexual Offences Act, which defined what sexual offences were. Before that it was a moral issue, the legal system skewed in favour of perpetrators. </p> <p>The Milimani Mums are calling for police to operate mobile units so that women can report cases from the safety of their own homes. Lilian Manegene, one of the protest’s co-organisers, says there are laws in place to protect women, but they are not enforceable because the victims are afraid of going to a police station. Currently, victims must report cases in person at police stations. </p> <p>Kenya’s truth, justice and reconciliation commission took this recommendation one step further, advocating a one-stop centre for victims of sexual violence to receive medical care and counselling, give evidence, and deal with police, under one roof in a place where they feel safe. </p> <p>The only voice absent from the noisy proceedings on 17 November was that of the woman in red whose stripping sparked it all. “The lady in red is sitting somewhere,” shouted Manegene, addressing the crowd. “We are living in fear.”</p> <p>“We hope by the end of this she’ll be bold enough to come out,” a bystander remarked. </p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/18/nairobis-miniskirt-march-exposes-sexual-violence-in-kenya","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2014/nov/18/nairobis-miniskirt-march-exposes-sexual-violence-in-kenya","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"The distraction economy: how technology downgraded attention","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-15T07:30:02Z","sectionId":"media-network","id":"media-network/media-network-blog/2014/dec/15/distraction-economy-technology-downgraded-attention-facebook-tinder","fields":{"body":"<p>After thinking about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/mar/07/second-screen-tv-battle-living-room\">second screens</a>, behavioural targeting and the success of <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/\">Buzzfeed</a>, marketers are at last coming to terms with the attention economy: the battle for monetising ephemeral interests. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gotinder.com/\">Tinder</a> may be leading the race, monopolising users for 15 minutes per day, but what are we doing the rest of the time?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/research-studies/the-new-multi-screen-world-study.html\">Google</a> reckons that we spend 4.4 hours of our daily leisure time in front of screens. Computers are mostly used for productivity and search, smartphones for connectivity, and tablets for entertainment. Multi-screening is, however, the new norm, with as many as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/tv-multitasking_n_3040012.html\">77% of consumers watching TV while on other devices</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks\">TED talks</a> are threatening to replace books and lectures, turning learning into “edutainment” and celebrating performance and storytelling over factual accuracy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix\">Netflix</a> invites us to spend more time selecting a movie than actually watching it and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a> provides an infinite cascade of videos to procrastinate in style.</p> <p>The 341 songs on my main <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/spotify\">Spotify</a> playlist should take 24 hours to play, but I can usually go through them in one, while answering no fewer than 20 emails per hour. This excludes my social media time, which I leave for when I’m stuck in traffic, or riding my bike. And, unlike most people, I find text messaging and WhatsApp too distracting. Some nations have been far more affected; in <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4137782.stm\">South Korea a man died after reportedly playing a 50-hour video game marathon</a>.</p> <h2>Crisis of attentiveness</h2> <p>Unsurprisingly, there is a crisis of attentiveness. When information is bountiful, attention is limited and precious. Unlike our evolutionary ancestors, who were probably rewarded for absorbing as much of their sensory surroundings as they possibly could, what’s adaptive today is the ability to ignore our distracting environments. Indeed, in times of information overload and non-stop media bombardment, distraction is destruction and the only recipe for focus is discipline and self-control.</p> <p>A one-time theoretical physicist, <a href=\"http://firstmonday.org/article/view/519/440\">Michael Goldhaber</a>, defined the attention economy as a “system that revolves primarily around paying, receiving and seeking what is most intrinsically limited and not replaceable by anything else, namely the attention of other human beings”. However, it seems more appropriate to describe our era as the distraction economy. Indeed the real war revolves around interrupting consumers’ focus and concentration, even for a few seconds. An integral part of this economy is measurement, since digital media allows us to quantify attention via clicks, likes, views and tags, allegedly improving our ability to understand and influence consumers. But if attention is the new currency of the digital economy, what are consumers getting in return?</p> <h2>What’s the value for consumers?</h2> <p>Not much. In fact, attention is valuable precisely because it is consumed by information overload, producing a vicious circle: we bombard you with content so that your attention becomes more valuable, which in turn justifies yet more content bombardment. “Attention here becomes the scarce quantity which is ‘consumed’ by that which is abundant, that is, information,” says <a href=\"http://www.culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/viewArticle/465\">Tiziana Terranova</a> in an insightful essay on this subject. The result is a degradation of attention that causes ADHD-like behaviours, such as impulsivity and boredom. These symptoms are best evidenced during digital withdrawal: those 20 minutes on the tube, or the six hours of downtime while flying over an ocean.</p> <p>As early as 1971 <a href=\"http://blog.adrianebsary.com/do-you-think-we-are-in-an-attention-economy-answered/\">Herbert Simon</a> observed that “what information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it”. Thus instead of reaping the benefits of the digital revolution we are intellectually deprived by our inability to filter out sensory junk in order to translate information into knowledge. As a result, we are collectively wiser, in that we can retrieve all the wisdom of the world in a few minutes, but individually more ignorant, because we lack the time, self-control, or curiosity to do it.</p> <p>There are also psychological consequences of the distraction economy. Although it is too soon to observe any significant effects from technology on our brains, it is plausible to imagine that long-term effects will occur. As Nicholas Carr noted in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Shallows-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/1441750002\">The Shallows: What the internet is doing to our brains</a>, repeated exposure to online media demands a cognitive change from deeper intellectual processing, such as focused and critical thinking, to fast autopilot processes, such as skimming and scanning, shifting neural activity from the hippocampus (the area of the brain involved in deep thinking) to the prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain engaged in rapid, subconscious transactions). In other words, we are trading speed for accuracy and prioritise impulsive decision-making over deliberate judgment. In the words of <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/\">Carr</a>: “The internet is an interruption system. It seizes our attention only to scramble it”.</p> <p>Some scientists take a fatalistic outlook on this, lamenting our inability to assess the long-term damage the attention economy will have on our minds. <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/56793/index1.html\">Professor David Meyer</a>, a leading multitasking scholar, compares the damage to the glory days of the tobacco industry: “People aren’t aware what’s happening to their mental processes in the same way that people years ago couldn’t look into their lungs and see the residual deposits.” Although this may be an overstatement, it is clear that our typical patterns of focus have changed dramatically in the past 15 years. To borrow the words of tech writer <a href=\"http://lindastone.net/qa/continuous-partial-attention/\">Linda Stone</a>, we are living in an age of “continuous partial attention”.</p> <p>Thank you for giving me yours.</p> <p><em>Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic is a professor of business psychology at University College London and vice-president of research and innovation at Hogan Assessment Systems.

Over the last decade, the growing size of the remittances market has attracted new kinds of players and payment models. Since 2009 the global average cost of sending remittances of $200 has been <a href=\"http://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">reduced from 10% to 7.9%</a>, saving migrants an estimated $54 billion. Moreover, analysis suggests that two individuals with access to any digital payment product could pay as little as 3.4% on average. <br /></p> <p>Technology plays an important role in two key aspects of remittance services: the consumer side (payment instruments) and the transaction side (payment infrastructure). Technological innovations on both sides are equally important to improving the efficiency and safety of these transfers.<br /></p> <p>Six key trends in applying technology to remittance transfers can be observed:<br /></p> <h2>1.<strong> Expanding existing payment system infrastructures for remittances</strong> </h2> <p>Card payments schemes and automated clearing houses (ACHs) are widespread and reliable in the payments space and typically have established standards, policies, and procedures. When two systems are directly connected in both sending and receiving countries (as is the case with <a href=\"http://www.directoamexico.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Directo-a-Mexico</a>), remittances can leverage such systems, incorporating additional rules for foreign exchange conversions and clearing and settlement, with the advantage of being open to a large number of participants. However, the total amounts transferred through these channels remain lower than cash-to-cash transfers.</p> <h2>2. Combining existing payment infrastructure and instruments </h2> <p>In many countries the existing payment systems’ infrastructure can be leveraged to create less expensive innovative products and services. Some banks and financial institutions that have presence in both sending and receiving countries have created new card-based products (e.g. dual cards) through which migrants’ families can withdraw remittances at ATMs or use for payments. Making use of the existing card infrastructure, this approach is more efficient, safer and cheaper than cash. However, not all regulators allow dual cards.<br /></p> <h2>3. Connecting international remittance services and payment instruments for domestic transactions </h2> <p>Electronic payment products are increasingly replacing cash in domestic transactions and, in some cases these products are used to deliver remittances to the beneficiary. E-money is an example of this. E-money issuers can be banks or non-banks depending on a country’s regulatory arrangements. These remittance products are based on contracts between international money transfer operators (MTOs) and payment service providers. <br /></p> <h2>4. New players fill gaps in existing payment infrastructures </h2> <p>In the last few years, new companies have started operating in the remittances market, enhancing the potential of the existing networks and creating bridges across countries. Some of the most notable examples are companies which provide white-label, cross-border payment services by enabling financial institutions to retain ownership of the customer and provide them with transparent and efficient cross-border payment products. Other companies have allowed interoperability among ACHs, the internet and mobile money, thereby creating a hub that allows services originally designed for domestic payments to also be used for international remittance transfers.</p> <h2>5. New players are leveraging existing banking and payment infrastructures</h2> <p> An increasing number of providers are offering online services, providing senders different options to pay for the transaction (from their bank accounts, with either a wire transfer or direct debit, or by debit or credit card). The sender can also choose different ways for the money to be delivered, for example to the beneficiary’s bank account or in cash at an agent in the receiving country.<br /></p> <h2>6. Existing businesses for other services enter money transfer businesses</h2> <p>This trend is not new in remittance businesses. Import companies and retail stores sometimes establish remittance companies. More recently, companies with an online presence are leveraging their own clientele and existing payment infrastructures to provide remittance services. For example, a company which provides foreign exchange information online is offering money transfer services. In this service, upon the customer’s instruction, the customer’s account is debited and the recipient’s bank account is credited. </p> <p>Despite the innovations outlined above, barriers continue to prevent technology from yielding greater impact on the remittances landscape. For a variety of reasons, the majority of remittances are still sent and/or received in cash. Both senders and/or receivers may lack access to non-cash payment instruments or even a bank or other transactional account. Whatever the technology, a number of intermediaries may still be necessary for transactions to be cleared and settled across borders – especially when two or more currencies are involved. Finally, overly stringent regulation may act as an obstacle to new solutions, while discordant cross-border regulations may pose an additional challenge.</p> <p><br />An efficient payment system, a proper regulatory framework, and enabling and competitive market conditions underpin new technology and innovations for remittance services. In addition, providing more people with access to transaction accounts would reduce use of cash in remittance transactions. While the landscape is unlikely to be completely revolutionised overnight, current progress should propel significant changes within the next decade.<br /></p> <p><em>Isaku Endo is a senior payment systems and remittances specialist and Marco Nicolì is a payment systems and remittances specialist with the World Bank Group.

A <a href=\"http://www.accenture.com/us-en/Pages/insight-accenture-seamless-retail-survey-2014-infographic.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent survey</a> by consulting firm Accenture showed that 74% of people in the US would travel to a store and make a purchase if they were offered real-time information on the availability of the product. It’s something already taking shape in Europe; according to a recent research report from eBay, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network-partner-zone-ebay/omni-channel-retailers-connected-consumers\">The omni-channel opportunity</a>, roughly one-third of UK and German consumers used multiple channels during recent purchases.</p> <p>Growing customer demand for real-time inventory visibility (up-to-the-minute data on what is in stock), convenience and a connected in-store experience presents a major technology challenge for retailers. This push for innovation is putting the industry at the forefront of experimentation with digital technology.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/marketing-agencies-association-partner-zone/ibeacons-shopping-2014\">Beacons</a> – which behave like an indoor GPS system to track, guide and serve personalised offers to shoppers in-store via their smartphones – are beginning to enter the mainstream. <a href=\"http://www.tesco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tesco</a> and <a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Waitrose</a> trialled beacon technology earlier this year, and <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Lewis</a>, which has invested £100,000 in a startup which specialises in micro-location technology, <a href=\"http://localz.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Localz</a>, is planning to use the tech in-store in the coming months. </p> <p>To keep people on the high street, stores are also focusing on offering engaging experiences. Sarah Leccacorvi, client service director at <a href=\"http://www.arcww.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arc</a>, a shopper marketing agency, says: “E-commerce is so sophisticated that getting footfall into bricks-and-mortar [stores] is going to be even tougher, so those engaging experiences are the ones to watch.”</p> <p>eBay, which has a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network-partner-zone-ebay/ebay-argos-click-and-collect\">click-and-collect partnership with Argos</a> in the UK, recently invested in <a href=\"http://blog.ebay.com/ebay-inc-and-westfield-partner-with-rebecca-minkoff-sony-and-toms-for-digital-storefronts/\" rel=\"nofollow\">digital storefronts</a> in a shopping mall in the US where consumers can buy items via a “smart window”. The online marketplace has also developed touchscreen “smart mirrors” for fitting rooms. They are being tested in US fashion store <a href=\"http://shop.nordstrom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nordstrom</a> in the run up to Christmas. The mirrors can recognise items in the fitting room and give recommendations. Jonathan Gabbai, head of international mobile product at eBay, says: “The ability for a retailer to increasingly bring more online technology to the physical world is going to drastically improve consumer engagement.” </p> <p>The advance of augmented reality in stores will be helped by the arrival of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/23/google-glass-on-sale-in-the-uk-for-1000\">Google Glass</a> on the market. Some retailers, including US store <a href=\"http://www1.bloomingdales.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloomingdales</a>, have tested virtual reality dressing rooms where customers can “try on” computer-generated outfits. Tech companies such as <a href=\"http://ibmsmartershopping.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IBM</a> and <a href=\"http://www.accenture.com/us-en/technology/technology-labs/Pages/index.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Accenture Technology Labs</a> have developed augmented reality apps which give customers reviews and offers on the products as they browse in-store, as well as allowing them to connect socially. <br /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/17/10-things-to-know-about-biometrics\">Biometrics technology</a>, which enables facial recognition, is another area of exploration. Tesco announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/03/privacy-tesco-scan-customers-faces\">plans last year to roll out facial recognition tech</a> to distinguish the age and gender of customers on digital advertising screens at its petrol stations. Biometric tech could in the future allow store to recognise individual customers as they enter and offer them a personalised service informed by their purchase history. </p> <p>However, retailers need to be wary of the intrusive nature of some of the tech available to them. “Personalised messaging has the potential to be a bit creepy,” warns Rick Murray, managing director, digital retail lead at Accenture. “Retailers have to make sure they get it right. People are prepared to share information about themselves if they know what they are getting in return.”</p> <p>Over the next decade, payment, which has evolved from plastic to contactless and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jul/05/contactless-payments-wristband-connects-to-bank-account\">wearable technology</a>, is forecast to be the most revolutionary change. “In a 10-year timescale we can expect almost all payments to be done digitally, through apps, the internet or wearable devices such as wristbands,” says Murray. </p> <p>As homes become more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/marketing-agencies-association-partner-zone/2014/sep/03/connected-home-brand-agencies\">connected</a>, retailers also have the potential to reach customers at new points of purchase decision-making, such as when they are in their kitchens. Waitrose is among those trialling <a href=\"http://www.waitrose.presscentre.com/Press-Releases/Waitrose-partner-with-start-up-Hiku-to-trial-home-scanning-in-UK-industry-first-f87.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanning devices for the home</a> to allow people to scan products they are running out of, which will then be automatically added to their online shopping basket. </p> <p>Subscriptions are another potential area for growth, offering people regular supplies of products from coffee to <a href=\"https://www.manpacks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">underwear</a>. In some cases, the products, such as <a href=\"http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/ads/instant-ink/overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">connected printers</a>, can even do the ordering themselves.</p> <p>The drive for convenience has meant retailers are also thinking about new and improved delivery methods. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network-partner-zone-ebay/2014/nov/13/click-and-collect-high-street\">Click-and-collect services are booming</a>, with collection points ranging from in-store to car parks. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/26/drones-quadcopoters-farms-drilling-utilities\">Commercial drones</a>, enabling instant delivery, could even be on the horizon (literally) in the not too distant future.</p> <p>As retailers continue to acquire high quality data and the ability to serve customers anytime and anywhere, they are in effect becoming digital businesses. But they must keep innovating to best serve the new digitally-native generation, says to Stephen Millard, chief executive of retail innovation firm <a href=\"http://eccomplished.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eccomplished</a>: “The ability to interconnect smart people with smart products, combined with rich data based upon an understanding of individuals, their identities, family and social groupings, and of course location, offers up incredible opportunities for a reinvention of the industry.”</p> <h2>More like this</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/oct/21/-sp-christmas-e-commerce-expert-tips-retailers\">Christmas commerce: expert tips for retailers</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/sep/23/ecommerce-hacks-retail-tips-selling-power\">Eight e-commerce hacks to increase your online selling power</a><br />• <strong>Brought to you by eBay:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network-partner-zone-ebay/2014/nov/03/click-and-collect-boost-festive-spending\">Click-and-collect to boost Christmas spending</a></p> <p><strong><em>This advertisement feature is provided by </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.ebayinc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong><em>eBay</em></strong></a><strong><em>, sponsors of the Guardian Media Network’s </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/technology-in-retail\"><strong><em>Technology in retail</em></strong></a><strong><em> hub</em></strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network-partner-zone-ebay/2014/dec/11/technology-reinvention-retail-industry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media-network-partner-zone-ebay/2014/dec/11/technology-reinvention-retail-industry","sectionName":"eBay partner zone"},{"webTitle":"How technology is changing marketing","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-29T11:14:20Z","sectionId":"media-network","id":"media-network/media-network-blog/2014/sep/29/technology-changing-marketing-digital-media","fields":{"body":"<p>A transformation of marketing is underway as we spend more time on our mobiles, tablets and laptops. The challenge for brands is to connect with customers through all these devices in real time and create campaigns that work across social media, display advertising and e-commerce.</p> <p>The real-time conversations brands have with people as they interact with websites and mobile apps has changed the nature of marketing. The modern-day marketing department needs to combine the creative side of the discipline – using powerful narratives to tap into people’s wishes and aspirations – with the technical side of data, digital engineering and analytics. The two areas do not always sit easily together. Getting creative marketers to work alongside technical staff can be a huge challenge.</p> <p>To explore these issues, the Guardian, in association with software firm Adobe, invited a panel of five top marketers and digital chiefs to discuss the matter before an audience of about 50 marketing and digital professionals. The question they addressed was: “What does the merging of technology and marketing mean for marketers?”</p> <p>The panel examined the challenges of bringing together these two distinct worlds. Marketing is concerned with understanding people’s motivations and using these insights to create campaigns that promote brands and encourage people to buy their products. It is a creative and often intuitive process. The technology used to achieve this, however, requires skills in mathematics, statistics and computing. How can these two different areas work together effectively?</p> <p>As Guardian News and Media’s chief digital officer Tanya Cordrey told the panel: “Where marketing hasn’t changed is the creativity and the passion from brands that have really helped build loyalty and emotion.” But she added: “Those things you still need, but almost all aspects of marketing have changed very dramatically.”</p> <p>Three areas of marketing which have been transformed by digital are the speed, relevance and reach of campaigns. Mark Singleton, head of sportsbook marketing at betting brand Paddy Power, recalled an incident in the Premiership last March when Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew headbutted Hull City midfielder David Meyler in a touchline clash. Within half an hour, Paddy Power had reacted to the incident with wit and speed by booking print ads referring to the incident for the next morning’s press. The bookie offered a money-back guarantee on bets for Newcastle’s following fixture should one of its team score a header.</p> <p>“To be able to turn around a press ad at half past four in the afternoon and for it to be in the papers the next morning is fantastic, it wouldn’t have happened four or five years ago,” said Singleton. “The rise of digital means you can be incredibly fast,” he added.</p> <p>Digital marketing has also greatly increased relevancy. Messages can be targeted with a laser focus to very specific groups offering them relevant content.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the reach of campaigns has also increased greatly. With so many different ways that customers access media, whether through Facebook, YouTube, news websites, via mobile or tablet apps, a strong idea can quickly gain huge scale. “If you come up with that nugget of an idea, you’ve now got such reach that you can expand that and get tremendous coverage just from a little niche idea,” said Singleton.</p> <p>Marketers need to update their skills in order to make the most of these fast-moving, and highly relevant campaigns through digital. They need to work closely with data specialists, web developers and social media professionals. Charles Wells, chief marketing officer at charity fundraising service JustGiving, told the panel that the marketer of the future needs to combine marketing and creative skills with an understanding of real-time technology. He said his marketing team has data scientists, engineers, developers and user experience experts, who work together in small project teams to try and create growth. This is a radical change from the way traditional marketing departments work, he said.</p> <p>He thought the big task for people in marketing would be to find their own niche: “The biggest challenge for the marketer of the future isn’t how do I get skilled up, but how do I get to fit into this machine and which cog am I going to try and be?”</p> <p>Just as marketers need to become more savvy about technology, data and analytics, so the technically minded staff on the digital side have to get more creative. They are rising to this challenge, said Wells. A fifth of staff at JustGiving are data strategists whose sole job is to identify patterns from the data the service gathers from millions of charity fundraisers. “They are probably some of the most creative people in the building, they are looking for fascinating things and they are building amazing engines,” said Wells. “Some of the algorithm stuff I’ve seen over the past few months has been some of the sexiest marketing I’ve seen for a long time,” he added.</p> <p>A vital quality for marketers in the fast-changing digital environment is curiosity, rather than any specific technical knowledge, said Adobe digital marketing director John Watton.</p> <p>“It’s not about a particular tool or system, it is about being curious about other possibilities because the tools we will use in two or three years time will be totally different from the ones we were using two years ago,” he told the discussion.</p> <p>A question about the effectiveness of digital marketing was raised by audience member Steve Mullins, content director of brand-e. He felt that targeted advertising hasn’t really improved over the years and that brands are spending a lot of money on technology without necessarily reaping rewards. “Should the merger of buying and tech mean buyer beware?” he asked.</p> <p>Lisa Bridgett, sales and marketing director at upmarket online fashion retailer Net-a-Porter, answered that marketers ultimately need to rely on their natural intuition rather than on technology.</p> <p>She referred to programmatic ad buying, where computers buy and place online ads in an automated way, and said that there are few people who really understand how such technology works.</p> <p>“You can’t just say that the technology is perfect because of course it’s not. In fact, I’m sitting with my agency and really unpicking programmatic and the truth is that they don’t understand it at all. I don’t actually think that there is anyone who understands a lot of these things when you get into the world of big data.” She added: “What I do is build up an arsenal of data and then I use my intuition. Time and time again it plays out right. So you need to be dextrous in these two different worlds.”</p> <p>For brands to work effectively together in the digital world, chief marketing officers and chief information officers must work in unison. But this is hard to achieve for many organisations and the two sides can end up in conflict. Pure digital players such as Net-a-Porter that have always been digital are structured for the digital age.</p> <p>But “legacy” businesses that need to undergo a digital transformation must decide who should lead that change. Should it be the chief information officer or the chief marketing officer or perhaps someone from a different department? As Adobe’s Watton said: “There is a battle going on. I don’t know who will win that battle.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Hema Chauhan, marketing executive at agency TMW, asked whether brand teams, technologists or agencies were best placed to implement new technology systems. The panel agreed that it is usually agencies who are responsible for this. But JustGiving’s Charles Well said agencies had to stop trying to pitch technology and start offering creative ideas that can improve the organisation. “My challenge to agencies is do what you are really good at, which is to come up with amazing ideas,” he said.</p> <p>The question of how businesses should identify the marketers and technologists of the future was raised by Omaid Hiwaizi, chief strategy officer at agency Geometry Global. “Do you filter them out, grow them or hire millennials and put up with them?” he asked.</p> <p>The panel agreed that having a mix of millennials and more experienced staff was important. Paddy Power’s David Singleton said it was a struggle trying to hang on to good staff, who might go elsewhere. And Adobe’s John Watton said: “You need a balance, you need experienced people who have learned some of the pitfalls. We re-skill people on the job, we move people from traditional content roles into web content roles and spot opportunities for people to move towards more data roles.”</p> <p>Another audience member, Gregory Gillette, insight analyst at agency 1000 Heads, asked what kind of skills were needed from those looking to get into marketing.</p> <p>Net-a-Porter’s Lisa Bridgett said she was impressed by the millennial generation as they see no boundaries to what they can do. Marketers can come from many backgrounds: “I think the dexterity around the disciplines is fantastic,” she said.</p> <p>Those looking for a career in marketing must be prepared to bring together the magic of marketing and the science of technology to create powerful and relevant marketing campaigns. </p> <p>Bridgett summed up the challenge. “The real stars are the ones who can balance a passion for technology, data, fashion and creativity at the same time.”</p> <h2>Key discussion points</h2> <p>How has the explosion of digital technology changed marketing? This was the theme of the discussion panel organised by the Guardian in association with Adobe. Today’s connected consumers are using smartphones, iPads, laptops - and even glasses and watches - to access content. As a result, marketing departments need to provide compelling campaigns across these different devices and become proficient in using technology. Marketers need to work closely with IT departments and technologists. They need to understand the processes behind developing websites, handling data and running social media campaigns. The panel discussed how marketers could develop the skills to enable them to work hand in hand with technologists while retaining their creativity, flair and intuition. </p> <h2>At the table</h2> <p><strong>Robin Hough (Chair),</strong> editor, Guardian Media Network</p> <p><strong>Charles Wells,</strong> chief marketing officer, JustGiving </p> <p><strong>Tanya Cordrey,</strong> chief digital officer, Guardian News &amp; Media</p> <p><strong>John Watton,</strong> director, digital marketing EMEA, Adobe</p> <p><strong>Lisa Bridgett,</strong> director of global sales and marketing, Net-a-Porter </p> <p><strong>Mark Singleton,</strong> head of sportsbook marketing, Paddy Power </p> <h2>Credits</h2> <p><strong>Seminar report</strong> commissioned and controlled by the Guardian. <strong>Discussion </strong>hosted to a brief agreed with Adobe. <strong>Funded </strong>by Adobe.

He is working with the Kenyan government to develop a curriculum for deafblind children. Edwin is visually impaired, giving him firsthand experience of the challenges children can face.</p> <p>Edwin will be online on <strong>Wednesday from 1pm-2.30pm GMT</strong> to answer your questions about his day job and the place of disability within development. What would you like to know? Post your questions in the comment thread below.</p> <p><strong>What’s a typical day for you?</strong><br />I start my day at 6am by catching up with the news. I work with the Kenyan department for education, so it is important that I’m up to date. I arrive at work at 8:30am where my first task is to read and respond to emails. From mid-morning, I handle all meetings, with government officials, parents or teachers. After lunch, I work on reports, strategies and campaign briefs. We are currently campaigning for the government of Kenya to immunise against rubella, which causes thousands of children to be born deafblind if their mothers catch it during pregnancy.</p> <p>Before the day is out I might meet with groups such as The Kenya Parents of Deafblind People Organisation. We supported families to set up this group, which has 345 members and spearheaded a campaign for the recognition of deafblind children’s education. I am also studying for a master’s degree in development management.</p> <p><strong>What is the most challenging aspect of your job?</strong><br />Every deafblind person that we support is different and meeting their needs can is a challenge. Being deafblind is not an absolute, some people have some sight or some hearing; others have none at all. Some people are born deafblind as a result of congenital rubella or birth complications, others lose their sight and hearing as result of accident or illness. Our programmes have to cater to this huge range.</p> <p><strong>How does your visual impairment affect you at work?</strong><br />It can be difficult when partners I’m working with aren’t aware of my visual impairment so don’t present information in an accessible way. Understanding how someone interprets a written document if they can’t see it is a real skill. However, it does give me firsthand experience of the challenges disabled people can face and the support the visually impaired or deafblind children might need.</p> <p><strong>Campaigners have said disabled people are being ignored by global development targets. Do you agree?</strong><br />There are 1 billion disabled people in the world and 80% live in developing countries. Disabled people also tend to be some of the poorest and least socially mobile. They need specialist support. Yet DfID currently has no dedicated policy for people with disabilities and millennium development goals don’t mention it at all.</p> <p>But things are changing. I gave evidence in the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/news/disability-and-development-1st-ev-session/\">first international development select committee inquiry into disability</a> and we are working to secure a place for disability in the future development goals. I am hopeful for a future where all disabled people will have the opportunity to benefit from international development.</p>  <h2><strong>Q&amp;A highlights:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/30827524\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11748342\" title=\"View BlackberryBlossom’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2013/04/14/11748342/5e9da735-11cf-4283-b9dc-13fa05525313/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for BlackberryBlossom\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11748342\" title=\"View BlackberryBlossom’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">BlackberryBlossom</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/30827524\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">15 January 2014 10:59am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>What type of educational work do you provide for deaf-blind children?

How do you communicate with someone who is deafblind? It varies greatly for person to person but here are a few ways:<br />Where a child has no communication, they might be helped to learn some simple hand signs at first (for 'food’ for example)<br />They might also learn to use an 'object of reference’ to communicate. For example, if they hold out a mug this means that they want a drink<br />The people around the deafblind child can learn, though observation, to understand their body language and what they seem to want to communicate<br />Some people may be able to learn a more advanced form of sign language. In Bangladesh for example, people have been learning Bangla sign language, which is an adaption of the country’s sign language for deaf and deafblind people.<br />Those that have residual vision can learn ordinary sign language.<br />Technology also has the potential to help people communicate. For example, someone who has learned to read Braille can access the internet via a Braille keyboard<br />Recently in Kenya we have established a deafblind curriculum to help ensure that what is being taught in schools meets a certain standard and is uniform.

If they want to be doctors, traders, police officers, they can choose whichever career they want.”</p> <p>In Miendo, a group of women gathered beneath a mango tree are discussing their loan repayments with a representative from One Acre Fund (OAF), a Kenya-based NGO partly funded by the Gates Foundation that provides fertiliser, seeds and solar lights to about 200,000 farmers in Burundi, Kenya, Tanzaniaand Rwanda.</p> <p>The organisation, which also has trials in Ethiopia and Malawi, employs 823 local staff in Kenya who check in with farmers every week and collect loan repayments. Those enrolled in OAF are split into groups of about a dozen; when one farmer cannot repay a loan, others in the group have to pick up the slack or face being cut off.</p> <p>The meeting’s host, Topista Musombi, 40, says she borrowed 4,100 shillings (£30) from the organisation, which she used to buy fertiliser and an oil barrel of seeds. This has helped boost her farm’s output from about 270kg of maize last year to 810kg in this year’s harvest, she says.</p> <p>Musombi also bought solar lights, which reduced her electricity bill and came in useful during the sporadic power outages.</p> <p>“We have found that lending to farmers is most effective when we lend seed and fertiliser instead of cash.

Since 2007, 68 new desalination plants have been built across the Caribbean, which now boasts an installed capacity of 782,000 cubic metres of purified water per day, according to the <a href=\"http://www.caribda.com/\">Caribbean Desalination Association</a> (CaribDA). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"beddf77be556b665a7e91d299c5ec27dcbbfe20d\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/17/1424205312770/43219543-253f-4b80-b34d-65ad69608b1b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Desalination plant in Willemstad, Curacao\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Desalination plant in Willemstad, Curacao.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nik Wheeler/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some islands, such as St. Martin, St. Thomas and the British Virgin Islands, where UK-based water treatment firm Biwater just inaugurated a <a href=\"http://www.biwater.com/Articles/425566/Biwater/BW_Home/Media/News_articles/Seawater_Desalination_Plant.aspx\">new $43m (£28m) plant with a 10,400 cubic metres daily capacity</a>, are almost entirely dependent on the technology for their domestic water supply. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of these islands could not survive without desalination. Their overall economies would collapse</p> <footer> <cite>Paul Choules</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“A lot of these islands could not survive without desalination. Their overall economies would collapse”, says Choules, who describes the technology as a “drought-proof solution” in a world facing ever more erratic weather patterns.</p> <h2>Counting the costs of freshwater</h2> <p>Desalination isn’t without its challenges, however. By far the biggest and most obvious relates to energy consumption. Huge amounts of power are required to operate commercial-scale desalination – power that is often produced by importing expensive fossil fuels.</p> <p>With large natural gas deposits offshore, Trinidad and Tobago is a rare exception to such import dependency. The fact that the twin island country is home to the largest <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/reverse-osmosis.htm\">reverse osmosis desalination</a> plant in the Western hemisphere - Desalcott - is therefore perhaps no coincidence.</p> <p>“We’ve got industry that can afford to pay for it [desalinated water] and large water demand … but desalination in general is relatively expensive, [so] it’s more difficult for small islands that don’t have the industry”, says John Thompson, general manager of Desalcott and president of industry group <a href=\"http://www.caribda.com/\">CaribDA</a>.</p> <p>Energy typically amounts to one-third of a typical plant’s operating costs, increasing to as much as two-thirds in some cases, says Thompson. Being quick to adopt energy-efficiency innovations has therefore become a hallmark for the region’s desalination operators. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/feb/10/us-food-oil-gas-water-shortages\">US harvest threatened by water-intensive oil and gas boom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s a view echoed by Gerard Pereira, vice president of engineering at Consolidated Water, a desalination firm based in the Cayman Islands where electricity costs around $0.40 per kilowatt hour – more than four times the price in the US. “Just out of necessity, we design and build the most efficient plants in the world”, says Pereira.</p> <p>Consolidated Water was among the early adopters of <a href=\"http://www.waterworld.com/articles/iww/print/volume-12/issue-1/feature-editorial/examining-isobaric-energy-recovery-systems-at-swro-plants.html\">isobaric energy recovery devices</a>, which Pereira credits for helping recover up to 98% of the unused energy in the waste streams of desalination plants. The Grenadine islands of Petite Martinique and Curaçao, meanwhile, recently installed two solar-power desalination plants in a $2.1m project part-funded by UK development agency DFID.</p> <p>“The Caribbean has tended to be where a lot of firsts have happened”, Pereira says, pointing out that Aruba and Curaçao built the first commercial desalination plants more than 80 years ago. </p> <p>Advances in membrane and pump technologies present further ways of reducing desalination’s energy requirements, but the sense from industry experts is that many of the big energy-saving wins may already have been had. </p> <p>“There is a thermodynamic limit for desalination”, says David Maingot, regional sales manager at LG NanoH20, a manufacturer of nanocomposite membrane technology that has carried out about 20 retrofits in the Caribbean over the last three years. “We’re getting close to that, so it’s kind of limiting unless you change the actual reverse osmosis technology.”</p> <h2>Wildlife concerns</h2> <p>Alongside its dependency on expensive - not to mention carbon-intensive - power supply, environmentalists have raised concerns over the <a href=\"http://pacinst.org/publication/desal-marine-impacts/\">impacts of large-scale desalination on marine life</a>. In particular, open intakes of seawater can cause fish and other larger organisms to become trapped.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/20/turning-human-waste-into-drinking-water\">How to turn human waste into drinking water – and more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A potentially safer alternative lies in subsurface intakes from coastal aquifers, a technique that extracts seawater from beneath the seafloor or beaches.

Ideally it should constitute only “one choice out of a number of options”, he says, and not necessarily the top one either. However, while desalination may be more expensive and energy-intensive than some options, desalination remains the crucial answer to freshwater access in regions with heavy dry seasons.</p> <ul> <li><em>This is the first in a three part series on islands and water which we will be publishing over coming weeks.

Buying the land at current prices would cost her up to 500,000 shillings.</p> <p>Members hold monthly meeting – Chebet has just attended her 20th – where their contributions, referred to as shares, are put on the table. Every member has a passbook to record her savings and each is entitled to a short- or long-term loan equivalent to three times her shares, up to a maximum of 500,000 shillings.</p> <p>The group allows long-term borrowers to repay at a 1% interest rate over 36 months, while short-term borrowers are required to pay off the debt in a month at a 10% interest rate.</p> <p>Chebet wants a long-term loan to buy a 50 metre x 100 metre plot of land to diversify her activities, and hopes to secure it by June. On the land she leased with the loan she obtained in April last year, Chebet planted beans. She harvested 15 bags of 90kg, selling them at 4,200 shillings. She made a total of 63,000 shillings, with which she repaid the loan and boosted her shares.</p> <p> </p> <p> “All that is needed is the virtue of mutual trust, openness and honesty for the fellow members to guarantee me with their savings,” she says, adding that it is a relief not to have to provide collateral. If Chebet had an alternative, she would opt for a bank loan to acquire the land before prices double, but lack of assets limit her.</p> <p>Jane Towett, a fellow member, considers herself “rich” since she began rearing goats with a 50,000 shilling advance. “I bought four goats and I am selling milk. I plan to sell them once they deliver and buy a dairy cow,” says Towett, who is also a member of two similar groups.</p> <p>For Linnah Kirui, the group’s chairwoman, table banking has brought domestic harmony. “I no longer have conflicts with my husband over money,” says Kirui, who now runs a grocery store that she started with a 15,000 shilling loan. Kirui says that so far no one in the group has defaulted on a loan.</p> <p>Jennifer Kigen, the executive director of the Rongai Social Economic Women Organisation, an NGO that educates women on table banking, says unsecured loans have given women financial freedom and a way out of poverty.</p> <p>Table banking groups also provide practical remedies if a member gets into difficulty in repaying a loan. Kigen says: “In a genuine case, for instance a woman invested in planting beans and they failed, then members fundraise to clear the loan for her.

They’ll go out to play and perhaps leave the room to go to a specialist lesson, such as music, art or sport. But most of their day is spent within the same four walls.</p> <p>And so it has been for hundreds of years – children divided into groups of 25 or more, given chairs and desks, maybe a bit of carpet, a teacher and told to get on with it. The rationale being that this is how children need to be taught: ie on a chair, with somewhere to write, while they are listening, and listening… and listening. And, naturally, behaving.</p> <p>Of course, the best teachers have always sought to do more than merely instruct their pupils and have created opportunities to learn in an individual way – be it in a kinaesthetic approach (ie a hands-on way of cementing the learning process in the mind) or by talking, reading and discovering for themselves. </p> <p>However, the widespread adoption of tablets – in around 70% of schools according to recent figures – might signal a step-change in the independence of pupils and their ability to take charge of their own learning. Whether it is iPads, Chromebooks or Lenovos, such devices allow a significant degree of flexibility in how pupils explore topics and respond to learning prompts. </p> <p>They are ideal tools for problem-solving tasks, in which children can work both individually and collaboratively, and then share that work. Pupils can essentially be given a considerable amount of freedom to produce work how they want – which could be via an app that “explains everything”, making a keynote presentation, shooting a iMovie or creating an iBook to reflect on an idea and share it with their peers. </p> <p>Yet the spaces surrounding these children are rigid and inflexible, reflecting centuries of containment and control. So, if we do want children to work more independently, to be more responsible for their own learning, shouldn’t we adapt their academic environment to reflect this? Does the classroom need to be so rigid, when the tools pupils are now using to learn are inherently so flexible? </p> <p>What could such a new classroom space look like? Many children like sitting on the floor so comfortable floor space could be provided, with cushions or small stools; others like standing, so “perches” for them to cluster around and lean against with angled resting surfaces (for tablets or books); organic tables (at a child’s scale), that allow pupils to talk to each other close up; stackable chairs for those who prefer to sit; a blank screening wall to share work via mini-projectors; and easy access to the outdoors for inspiration and thinking space. A freer, more flexible environment. In other words, anything but desks in rows. The teacher is still there but hopefully not standing at the front and lecturing anymore.</p> <p>Because space transmits culture so powerfully, classrooms need to reflect what skills and values schools aim to develop in their pupils. They need to become places in which pupils want to learn, in which such learning becomes “irresistible”. </p> <p>Is there now enough momentum behind the new ways in which children learn and how they learn for there to be a real change in where they learn? The Italian teacher Loris Malaguzzi highlighted 70 years ago the importance of environment to learning, arguing that children learn first from their parents and teachers (adults), second from other children (peers) and thirdly from the space around them (environment) – yet this “third space” is often neglected in schools. Technology, though, might just provide the catalyst that allows schools to break out of a facilities straightjacket and focus on specifically designing the best possible spaces for learning to take place.</p> <p><em>Will Wareing is the deputy director of education, innovation and learning at the <a href=\"http://www.gdst.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Girls’ Day School Trust</a> (GDST).</em><br /></p> <h2>Content on this page is provided and funded by <a href=\"https://iaps.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS)</a>, supporter of the “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/series/on-the-other-side-of-the-fence-working-in-independent-schools\">Working in independent schools</a>” series.</h2>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/iaps-partner-zone/2015/feb/13/technology-teaching-reshape-classrooms","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/iaps-partner-zone/2015/feb/13/technology-teaching-reshape-classrooms","sectionName":"IAPS partner zone"},{"webTitle":"David Harewood: Kenya's eternal summer drove home climate impact","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-11T09:44:49Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2015/feb/11/david-harewood-kenya-climate-change-coalition-valentines-day-shakespeare-sonnet","fields":{"body":"<p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/24/if-obama-cameron-listen-food-everyone\">trip to northern Kenya six years ago</a> convinced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-harewood\">David Harewood</a> of the realities of climate change.</p> <p>“I can remember going to a village one day and walking through a field full of dead cattle, which had basically just starved,” says the actor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/guardianwitness-blog/gallery/2015/feb/11/guardianwitness-climate-change-valentines-day-in-pictures\">GuardianWitness: Climate change on Valentine's Day – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I walked for about five minutes through all these dead cattle.

A aeroplane from a nearby conservancy has done a flyby, and a car has been deployed, but on this sand, where roads are virtually nonexistent, it is difficult to cover the ground. Wheeler wants to have a look for himself. \"We are doing all we can with every tool we have available; on foot, by vehicle, by plane and now by para-motor,\" he says.</p><p>A quietly spoken young Kenyan, Wheeler's face becomes animated when he talks about birds– he has a sanctuary for rehabilitating birds of prey – and his jaw becomes set with uncharacteristic anger when the topic of poaching comes up, as it inevitably does. Africa's wild elephants are being killed at their fastest rate since 1979-89, the bloody decade in which their number more than halved from 1.4m to 600,000.

Speaking earlier this year at the British high commission in Nairobi, the UK minister for natural resources, Richard Benyon, said organised gangs and militias now used helicopters and gun silencers to poach. \"State of the art technology is being used to prosecute this dreadful trade,\" said Benyon.</p><p>Also speaking, Christian Turner, the high commissioner, added: \"Illegal wildlife trade is the 5th largest illicit transnational activity and the potential for profits of poaching to feed back into terrorist activity is real.\"</p><p>Earlier in July, the US pledged $10m to combat the trade during Barack Obama's visit to Tanzania.

While this is significant year politically, it is also arguably the most important year for Kenyans in terms of the way social media has influenced and enabled their political engagement.</p><p>The growth in internet penetration in Kenya over the five past years, has been so rapid it's been branded 'silicon savannah'. In the social media stakes, <a href=\"http://www.ihub.co.ke/ihubresearch/jb_VsReportpdf2013-8-29-07-38-56.pdf\" title=\"\">Kenyans are second only to South Africans</a> in Africa for the quantity of tweets they put out.</p><p>The hate speech that had been spoken on Kenya's streets and led to post-election violence in 2007 and 2008, by 2013 had migrated online, with the 18 million-strong internet population congregating in Facebook groups, behind Twitter avatars, and online at blogs and forums. The 2013 general election isn't just remembered for the televised debates (a first in Kenya) but also by Four-square check-ins, tweets and images from all over the country. And when president Kenyatta's win was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/31/kenya-court-upholds-kenyatta-victory\" title=\"\">upheld in the Supreme Court</a>, Twitter discussionsv acted as the citizen's gallery outside the courtroom.</p><h2>Political activism from a disengaged middle class</h2><p>In 2012, Boniface Mwangi and a number of graffiti artists made provocative street art exhibits that caricatured Kenyan members of parliament, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">branding them as vultures and making headlines around the world</a>. The nation took notice but didn't act or appear to be as moved as perhaps the activist may have envisioned. In June 2013, Boniface rallied Kenyans online – on Twitter, Facebook – to take to the streets in a protest against legislators who were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/12/kenyan-mps-accept-pay-cut\" title=\"\">determined to give themselves a hefty pay rise</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bonifacemwangi/status/365914247194091520\" title=\"\">#OccupyParliament</a> was born.</p><p>The result saw an unprecedented number of the Kenyan \"digerati\" and middle class protest and peacefully express their position to lawmakers. Standing in place for Kenyans from all backgrounds they were creative in their slogans and props (including the most controversially, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22522846\" title=\"\">the use of pigs</a>). It is undeniable that the #OccupyParliament demonstrations have heralded a new age of activism.</p><h2>Decrypting Westgate: terrorism in the digital age</h2><p>This year also saw tragedy in the form of the Westgate Mall attack. The Al-Qaeda linked groupm, Al Shabaab, used Twitter in a way that  in today's digital age, the terrorists are as connected – and prepared to use that connectivity – as their victims. Kenyans retweeting and responding to the militant group didn't realise they were playing into their hands by amplifying their message when traditional media wouldn't.</p><p>Kenya's traditional media came under fire, again on social media, for its ethics when portraying the crisis. A <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelzarrell/outrage-over-newspaper-images-of-kenyan-attack\">front cover of the Daily Nation sparked uproar  </a>and the newspaper's managing editor lost his job as a result..</p><p>But the overwhelming power of social media has been in its ability to unify Kenyans and spread a message of solidarity following the Westgate attack. The hashtag #WeAreOne went on to feature in political speeches telling the Kenyan-Somali community that unity would prevail.</p><p>When the embers had cooled, Kenyans took once again to Twitter to question how well the security services had responded in the crisis. Known as \"the Westgate Questions\" concerned citizens <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14TPKjLym-hulKAZhca1xIE4YldJNyiAHx92xJBDpEQ4/preview?sle=true\" title=\"\">crowdsourced questions they felt were still unanswered</a> by mainstream media and the government. The 85 questions posted in that document are a great guage for what Kenyans are thinking and feeling, and social media facilitated their curation.</p><p>But even as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KenyaAt50&amp;src=tyah&amp;f=realtime\" title=\"\">#KenyaAt50</a> continues to attract hundreds of tweets, this one from chief justice <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WMutunga/status/411086046172958720\" title=\"\">Willy Mutunga</a> stands out: \"Seeing this great expression of patriotism and nationhood I agonize over the reality that we are not yet a nation!\" On Jamhuri Day social media can act as an echo box, amplifying a few voices or key messages but Dr Mutunga's tweet alludes to the fact that the whole truth isn't always conveyed in tweets.</p><p>As Kenyans celebrates, on and offline, there is no mention of the myriad of issues looming heavy on our hearts, from the rising tax hikes on the \"basket of goods\" that the common citizen relies on, to justice for the victims of post election violence. In this climate we cannot ignore that some members of parliament are determined to muzzle the media and civil society.</p><p>Kenya is an increasingly connected country and after the events of 2013, it is evident that how politicians engage with citizens and how civil society mobilises those same citizens won't be the same again.  On a weekend that sees the country celebrate 50 years of independence it is certain that despite all things – good and bad – that have taken place in 2013, the next 50 years will be transformed by personal technology, concerned citizens and the media.</p><p><em>Mark W Kaigwa is a social media consultant.

Take cervical cancer as an example: due to pap testing, cervical cancer is rare in Canada or the US; however, <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/shining-a-light-on-developing-worlds-biggest-killer-non-communicable-diseases-12925\" title=\"\">it is the number one cause of cancer deaths in Kenyan women</a>. Prevention and screening has just not been available or accessible to most people in Kenya. Most cases are often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, which is partly due to inadequate healthcare infrastructure.</p><p>The issue is exacerbated further by a faulty national health insurance plan that doesn't allow patients to afford medical services. The health system is inadequately designed and resourced – particularly for people with cancer – with poorly equipped hospitals, a low doctor to patient ratio, and a lack of access to affordable drugs. <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/shining-a-light-on-developing-worlds-biggest-killer-non-communicable-diseases-12925\" title=\"\">These factors lead to late presentation, complications and meagre patient follow-up</a>.</p><p>Widespread lack of awareness and accurate information about cancer is another reason why screening is rare and many cancers are detected when it is too late to treat effectively. Several cultural myths exist regarding cancer, which are critical obstacles to expanded cancer control and care in Kenya, especially when it comes to early detection. One popular myth is that cancer is caused by curses from ancestors and elders. In such cases, people even believe that you can 'catch' the disease from those who have it.</p><p>Although developing countries bear 80% of the cancer burden, only about 5% of global resources devoted to cancer are found in these countries. Most cancer care services in Kenya are concentrated within a 5km radius of each other in Nairobi, making it difficult for most Kenyans to access necessary care. The public national hospital hosts most of Kenya's oncology expertise and technology. About 78% of Kenyans live in rural areas, which means that many patients requiring care may travel up to 600km to access cancer services and the wait time for treatment at Kenyatta National Hospital is extremely long.</p><h2>Action required to reduce barriers to cancer prevention and care</h2><p>Prevention efforts, both on a personal and policy level, must be scaled up for <a href=\"http://www.who.int/cancer/prevention/en/\" title=\"\">preventable cancers </a>such as cervical cancer.</p><p>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), like cancer and other chronic conditions, share common behavioural risk factors that must be reduced to facilitate disease prevention: physical inactivity, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diet. <a href=\"http://iom.edu/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Global/ControlChronicDiseases/Sess2Sp2Yonga.pdf\" title=\"\">Smoking and alcohol abuse are on the rise in Kenya, air pollution is potent in urban areas, schools do not prioritise physical activity, obesity is on the rise, and the list goes on</a>.</p><p>Reduction of these NCD risk factors is not addressed sufficiently by the ministry of health and other policymakers. Only 5% of the Kenyan budget is spent on health – instead of the recommended 15%, and <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/shining-a-light-on-developing-worlds-biggest-killer-non-communicable-diseases-12925\" title=\"\">much of the cost is on treatment rather than prevention</a>. Robust prevention policies will result not only in lives saved in the long term, but also in long-term economic gains.</p><h2>Progress is on the horizon</h2><p>In 2012, <a href=\"http:// http://www.ipcrc.net/pdfs/Kenya-National-Cancer-Control-strategy.pdf\" title=\"\">Kenya established a National Cancer Prevention and Control Act</a>, making it one of the few countries in Africa with legislation for cancer. The Act, which stipulates the establishment of a National Cancer Institute among other important advances to counter this disease in Kenya, has yet to become operational.</p><p>During a launch of 2013 breast cancer awareness and screening month, the Kenyan ministry of health called for revenue allocation for cancer control in the government budget. The presence of the first lady, Margaret Kenyatta, and other government officials at the cancer-screening launch ignited hope for high-level commitment in reducing the cancer burden. The first lady declared that she and President Uhuru Kenyatta had been screened for cancer, encouraging the public to follow suit – potentially lifting some of the public's stigmatisation of cancer.</p><p>Kenya is currently undergoing decentralisation of government functions, including healthcare, which means that there is a renewed opportunity to integrate cancer care into other regions of the country and build an overall healthier Kenya. As 47 counties of Kenya absorb the healthcare mandate, it is expected that greater community involvement will result in tailored healthcare for each region. Devolution will facilitate more straightforward avenues for advocacy on NCDs at the county-level, as the decision-makers in government will be more localised and have so far demonstrated themselves as easier to communicate with. County health policymakers are usually also native to the communities that they serve and have a more vested interest in improved health outcomes in their designated regions, than the previous national level decision-makers.</p><p>For both healthcare devolution and expanded care for cancer, there is a push to build private-public partnerships. Both public and private healthcare providers must have a seat at the policy table and work together, as multi-sectoral action will have the biggest impact within communities.

The project will cost more than $600m (53bn Kenyan shillings/£400m) and implementation will begin this year.</p><p></p><p>This is not simply a procurement issue or a small part of a larger educational strategy. It is the strategy. The budget, released this month, <a href=\"http://www.citizennews.co.ke/news/2012/local/item/11232-budget-2013-2014-speech-by-henry-rotich\" title=\"\">claims</a> that the government \"has prioritised transforming the educational system to e-teaching and e-learning\". By contrast, the budget contained only 34.7bn shillings for healthcare, and 67bn for the police. In a country with extremely limited financial resources, this is a very bold move.</p><p></p><p>In some ways, the strategy seems to reinforce the image of Kenya as Africa's digital heart. The country has embedded digital services in its <a href=\"http://www.vision2030.go.ke\" title=\"\">national development plan</a>, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/03/kalonzo-musyoka-technology-city-kenya\" title=\"\">building a technology park</a> dubbed \"<a href=\"http://newmatilda.com/2013/06/14/kenyas-silicon-savannah\" title=\"\">silicon Savannah</a>\", is a pioneer in creating digital services and software (such as the M-Pesa mobile money transfer system and the <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/about-us\" title=\"\">Ushahidi crisis reporting platform</a>), and has one of the highest internet penetration rates on the continent.</p><p></p><p>But Kenya is characterised by deep economic inequalities. In the shadow of Nairobi's gleaming skyscrapers are millions of people who live in poverty. <a href=\"http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=ke&amp;v=69\" title=\"\">About half</a> the country's 41 million people live below the national poverty line, and measures including the Gini coefficient show <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality\" title=\"\">large gaps between rich and poor</a>. More than 15 million Kenyans <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/kenya/overview_4616.html\" title=\"\">still don't have access to safe water or sanitation</a>.</p><p></p><p>Despite free primary education, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/kenya/overview_4616.html\" title=\"\">more than 1 million Kenyan children of school age aren't attending classes</a>. Having a well-educated population is without doubt a way for the country to help itself out of poverty. But is betting the farm on e-teaching and e-learning a sensible strategy? More importantly, is it an equitable or just development approach?</p><p></p><p>Many of the project's specifics have yet to emerge, but there are still some important points to be made.</p><p></p><p>First, laptops alone won't solve any of the structural and social issues – including a lack of trained teachers, intermittent power supplies and thousands of malnourished children – facing Kenya.</p><p></p><p>Irrespective of how many stories we hear about the effectiveness of laptops being <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/506466/given-tablets-but-no-teachers-ethiopian-children-teach-themselves/\" title=\"\">dropped off to villages</a> in rural Africa – the approach adopted by One Laptop per Child's Nicholas Negroponte, for instance – <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/4988289\" title=\"\">technology alone cannot provide an education</a>. Among other things, children still need functioning schools, electricity and, crucially, trained teachers – tens of thousands are required, according to the <a href=\"http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000085935&amp;story_title=Kenya-teachers-cry-foul-after-treasury-snubs-demands/\" title=\"\">Kenya National Union of Teachers</a>.</p><p></p><p>Second, information and communication technologies are an <a href=\"https://edutechdebate.org/ict-in-schools/there-are-no-technology-shortcuts-to-good-education/\" title=\"\">amplifier of capabilities, skills, and social and economic positions</a>. Supporters of education projects based on laptop distribution often point to their success in connecting the previously disconnected. But while information technologies and the communication networks that link them are fantastic tools for people with the existing knowledge, skills and social networks to take advantage of them, they are less useful to those starting from a less privileged position. It is hard to see how the programme could do anything to address inequality without tackling its deeper roots.</p><p></p><p>Third, there is a long history of people and states framing technology as a solution to economic, social, political and environmental problems. IT becomes intertwined with notions of modernity and progress. Naively, they are seen not just as a tool, but as a panacea for development. Kenya's laptop project shows us how powerful these visions can be. Why get involved in the messy business of hiring thousands of teachers, building functioning schools, creating a stable electricity supply, and ensuring that all children are well-nourished, when laptops and e-learning will thrust the country into the digital economy?</p><p></p><p>Increased access to IT undoubtedly holds much promise for some of Kenya's youth. But the worry is that the resources invested in the project could have been better spent. Policymakers in other low-income countries will undoubtedly be watching closely; we need to ask who will ultimately benefit from the project and who may get left behind.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jun/27/kenya-laptops-schools","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jun/27/kenya-laptops-schools","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"How technology rewrites literature","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-23T11:37:24Z","sectionId":"books","id":"books/2014/jun/23/technology-rewrites-literature-tom-mccarthy-internet","fields":{"body":"<p>In an interview with the Paris Review, the American poet Frederick Seidel mentions a time in the 1970s when he visited an old girlfriend at Columbia University. Seidel's girlfriend was studying for a PhD in Electrical Engineering and during his stay the poet was given five minutes to work in a secure room on the Defence Department mainframe:</p><p>\"The computer was enormous and filled the room but it had such a tiny screen. I typed out the beginning of my poem Homage to Cicero and was hooked then and there. What hooked me was the way you could instantly change the shape of the stanza, the length of the line. It was the instantly part that got me.\"</p><p>With ebooks on course to outsell printed editions in the UK by 2018 much has been written about the subject of technology in terms of readers, but it's often overlooked that new tech does more than give writers a different cut of cloth to scribble on. Writing with electronic devices has affected structure, research and editing. It has affected order and it has affected rhythm, from the tap-tap-swipe of a typewriter to the swipe-swipe-tap of tablet.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440215032'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2013/10/23/1382545163633/Blake-Morrison-002.jpg' alt='Blake Morrison' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>No excuse for sloppinesss … Blake Morrison</figcaption></figure><p>\"In the early days of word processing you'd often hear the complaint that novelists were writing too much – not shaping as they used to when they had to work on a typewriter,\" says the poet and author Blake Morrison. \"I don't think it's true. When it's so easy to cut and paste, and to create multiple drafts rather than having to type them out afresh each time, there's really no excuse for sloppiness.\"</p><p>As Morrison suggests, the order offered by computers has made indexing, saving, copying and pasting all essential parts of putting together a modern piece of fiction. Writing with word processors has given a new organisation to shaping sentences but it has also given flexibility; paragraphs can be switched, flipped and thrown out with an ease that would've been impossible when working with a typewriter. As we become increasingly inundated with little black screens this fluidity is becoming ever more central to how writers shape their work.</p><p>\"Most notes are on my phone now. It's more subtle than taking out a notebook and means you can pick apart your friends or family while they think you are sending a text,\" says Joe Dunthorne, critically acclaimed author of Submarine.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440215033'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2011/3/8/1299609186708/joe-dunthorne-002.jpg' alt='joe dunthorne' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Lazier or freer?

The idea was that, eventually, all these lines would be rehoused. But increasingly I use the search function. In seconds, I can find every simile I've ever written about an onion or every description of a particular character asleep. I'm able to pull together resources in a much more fluid way. I can't quite decide whether this has made me a lazier writer or a freer one.\"</p><p>So does the inclusion of new digital techniques mean other parts of the author's process are being left behind?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440215034'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/23/1400845891779/Zoe-Pilger-003.jpg' alt='Zoe Pilger' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Necessary mess … Zoe Pilger</figcaption></figure><p>\"I write on a laptop. I've just got a really old laptop that weighs three tonnes so I never take it out of the house. The only time I write by hand is when I take notes. It's a complete mess,\" says Zoe Pilger, author of Eat My Heart Out and art critic for The Independent. \"Writing on paper in that way allows for incoherence and messiness which is a necessary stage of the creative process.\"</p><p>While most writers still work on paper at some stage, the act of physically underlining and crossing-out sentences is paling in comparison to digital highlights and tracked changes.</p><p>In Civilisation and its Discontents, Sigmund Freud links technology with amputation, with the tools created by man replacing his organs and limbs: \"Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God,\" says Freud. \"When he puts on all his auxiliary organs he is truly magnificent, but these organs have not grown onto him and they still give him much trouble at times.\"  Freud was a heap of dust by the time Microsoft Word came along, but does his point hold for modern writers? Has anything been lopped-off from the contemporary author to make room for all the new ways of writing?  \"Following Freud's logic of technology as prosthesis, what's been amputated from the writer in order to create the newest hard- and software?\" asks Tom McCarthy, author of the Booker Prize-shortlisted C.  His answer: \"Attention.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-440215035'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/7/26/1280143595487/Tom-McCarthy-001.jpg' alt='Tom McCarthy' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Attention amputation … Tom McCarthy</figcaption></figure><p>Many writers see the internet as a squat little monster sat on their chest, constantly offering distraction. McCarthy, however, is keen to avoid overstating its impact on writers. \"You have to be wary of presuming that the advent of the internet creates some new-media 'Year Zero' for the writer. Western literature begins with an account of a signal crossing space, in the&nbsp;Oresteia: a technologically-broadcast message whose reception, repetition and interpretation lay out the condition of the whole drama that follows. The hardware changes over time, but the base situation doesn't.\"</p><p>While McCarthy suggests that the basic situation of communication remains, other writers highlight how access to the internet has affected part of that process. \"In Eat My Heart Out there's a section that takes place in a neo-burlesque club,\" says Pilger. \"But I've never been to a neo-burlesque club in my life, so I researched it by watching a lot of burlesque routines on YouTube.  Another time I wanted to fictionalise a particular set by a particular band at a festival I'd been to. Whereas before writers would have to use their memory and imagination to embellish, I just looked it up on YouTube and could watch the exact set in 2007. Technology provided me with a memory.\"</p><p>Whether it's YouTube or Twitter, the contemporary writer can pull on disparate information, absorb it and paste it in their text. And that process can go both ways. Writing with new platforms; drafting on Google Docs, emailing paragraphs or uploading chapters to Dropbox, all pull the writer's work out of their private space and places it in a cloud. While this may make writing more systematic, it can also leave it vulnerable.</p><p>\"In the early 90s, when I lived in Berlin, I had this huge old typewriter,\" says McCarthy. \"It was an ex-Stasi one. With the collapse of the East German regime, and the gutting of its offices, the paraphernalia that had maintained the giant surveillance bureaucracy was flooding the flea markets and secondhand shops; you could get these typewriters really cheap. It had great long arms: you had to throw your fingers at the keys, and it made a loud noise - rapid-fire, like a machine gun.</p><p>\"Now, of course, I write on a laptop, like everyone else. But, in a way, the situation's come full circle: far from being obsolete, the apparatuses of state surveillance are (as we know) very much operative, embedded right inside the machine, or hovering around it in its network, like an aura.\"</p><p>Fom typing on a rolling stream of white space to editing in a cloud, shifts in hardware have altered the way writers research, draft, refine and, ultimately, conceive of their work. The basic mechanism may stay the same, but new tools have led to new relations between authors and the words they use.  With the internet, the barrier between the writer and the world has become as thin as skin. It's a skin that strokes and soaks but it's also a skin that's watched and recorded. One of the main outcomes of new hardware may be that, unlike Seidel's secure five minutes with the Defence Department mainframe, the contemporary writer is no longer alone in the room.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/23/technology-rewrites-literature-tom-mccarthy-internet","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/jun/23/technology-rewrites-literature-tom-mccarthy-internet","sectionName":"Books"},{"webTitle":"Somali online news editor under arrest in Kenya","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-07T07:08:29Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/greenslade/2014/oct/07/journalist-safety-somalia","fields":{"body":"<p>A Somali journalist working for an online news network is under detention in Kenya.

Yet these farmers labour under severe handicaps: remoteness from markets; lack of storage, seed and fertilisers; and weak bargaining power with buyers. A lack of information, particularly on prices, puts smallholders at a disadvantage.</p><p><a href=\"http://mfarm.co.ke/about\" title=\"\">M-Farm</a>, a Kenyan company co-founded in 2010, seeks to redress the balance in favour of smallholder farmers by addressing what co-founder Jamila Abass calls \"asymmetry of information\" – and make money in the process.</p><p>Abass created M-Farm with Susan Oguya and Linda Kwamnoka, inspired to act by stories about the exploitation of smallholders by middlemen offering meagre prices.</p><p>\"The exploitation of farmers is not new, it has been going on for a long time. We wanted to focus on agriculture and the challenges farmers had and the possibility of bringing about change,\" said Abass, who was in London this month to attend <a href=\"http://www.africagathering.org/\" title=\"\">Africa Gathering</a>, a networking event, and to talk to supermarkets about linking them to African smallholders.</p><p>Abass, 29, one of 19 children from a poor family, left her job as a systems developer at the Kenya Medical Research Institute and joined <a href=\"http://akirachix.com/\" title=\"\">Akirachix</a>, an IT hub that brings together women and technology. The launch of M-Farm followed a €10,000 (about £8,500) investment prize.</p><p>\"The competition was meant for men, but the timing was right because the technology sector was emphasising gender equality and the empowerment of women. We were very lucky,\" she said.</p><p>The publicity helped to garner $100,000, half in grant and half in loan, from the UK charity <a href=\"http://techfortrade.org/\" title=\"\">TechforTrade</a>, which supports innovative approaches to poverty alleviation.</p><p>M-Farm provides price information to farmers. By sending an SMS, farmers can see market prices in real time for their products – cassava, groundnuts, sorghum, passion fruit – so they do not get ripped off by buyers at their farms.</p><p>The company employs 10 people in five cities – Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Kisumu and Kitale – who collect daily price information on 42 crops across Kenya. About 7,000 farmers use the service, for which M-Farm takes a tiny cut from the mobile phone provider.</p><p>M-Farm makes its money by playing the role of middleman itself. In that way, the company does not cut out intermediaries completely, but reduces the three or four layers that chip away at the smallholders' cut. M-Farm employs 18 agents who link smallholders with buyers and charges a commission of 10-15% for the service. The agent's job is to get the best price for the farmers, typically by organising them to sell collectively in groups of 20 to 120.</p><p>\"If someone sells via M-Farm, they register with us details of the produce they want to sell and we charge a commission. It's similar to eBay,\" said Abass, adding that M-Farm has increased the prices its farmers have received.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-412628553'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/6/27/1372328350366/MDG--Kenya-tech-firm-tell-006.jpg' alt='MDG : Kenya tech firm tells farmers the real price of their produce : M-Farm market place' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Screengrab of Kenyan M-Farm market place with vegetables and their price, 27 June 2013.

About 5,000 farmers are using M-Farm as a middleman. The advantage for farmers is that they can count on a reliable buyer.</p><p>\"We are having to turn down farmers who want to join our service because we can't find enough buyers,\" said Abass. \"Spreading ourselves too thinly would be really risky for us.\"</p><p>This is why M-Farm is seeking to forge relationships with UK supermarkets. Supermarkets have a reputation for driving down the prices of their UK suppliers, but Abass says they could help smallholder farmers in Kenya.</p><p>\"Farmers in the UK have the luxury to complain about Tesco,\" she said. \"But in Kenya, if Tesco wanted to buy from farmers, it would double the price Kenyan farmers would receive and make a huge difference in boosting their livelihoods. We are not short of farmers, we need buyers. What is lacking is the market itself.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jul/04/m-farm-kenya-food-security","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/jul/04/m-farm-kenya-food-security","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"40,000 Kenyans accuse UK of abuse in second Mau Mau case","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-29T06:59:05Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2014/oct/29/kenya-mau-mau-abuse-case","fields":{"body":"<p>More than 40,000 Kenyans are attempting to sue the British government for compensation in a second Mau Mau group action, alleging physical abuse or mistreatment during the insurgency against colonial rule in the 1950s.</p> <p>The new litigation against the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has been lodged at the high court in London, and comes after the UK government last year paid out £19.9m to 5,228 Kenyans who suffered torture at the hands of the colonial administration during the uprising.</p> <p>The payout marked the government’s first official acknowledgment of serious abuse committed during Britain’s messy withdrawal from Kenya. The foreign secretary, William Hague, told parliament that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/05/kenyan-mau-mau-payout-uk-regret-abuse\" title=\"\">settlement</a> was “full and final”.</p> <p>However, seven British law firms have been assembling new claimants, in some cases dispatching lawyers to Kenya and advertising for clients in local newspapers.</p> <p>The new suit, according to the firms, involves 41,005 Kenyans and takes the form of a group litigation order, which allows related claims to be managed collectively. According to court documents filed in May, the high court will hear 25 test cases.</p> <p>Unlike the first Mau Mau case, these new claims are not restricted to those who endured extreme physical violence. Claimants are seeking damages for a range of alleged offences, including false imprisonment, forced labour and an interference with their right to education.</p> <p>Lawyers for the claimants say that a tentative trial date has been set for January 2016.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the FCO said: “It is not appropriate for us to comment on a case that is going through the courts.” It is understood the FCO is due to file its defence by Friday.</p> <p>The claims refer back to 1952, when the colonial governor, Sir Evelyn Baring, declared a state of emergency in Kenya in an attempt to quash a mounting anti-colonial insurgency known as Mau Mau. Over the ensuing eight years, an estimated 90,000 Kenyans were killed or injured.</p> <p>More than 1 million were forced from their homes into detention facilities, which Kenya’s then attorney general Eric Griffith-Jones described as “distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or communist Russia”. Some were Mau Mau rebels, but many were civilians caught in a dragnet of collective punishment.</p> <p>Simon Myerson QC, who is instructed by Tandem Law on behalf of the claimants, says his clients suffered a variety of abuses, including castration. Each is seeking damages of between £1,000 and £150,000.</p> <p>Lawyers also accuse the colonial administration of having crafted a system of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment. Under this formulation, Britain would be liable for abuse carried out by a variety of agents at the time —including the Kenya Police and Kenya Home Guard—on the grounds that the abusive “system” was imposed at the highest levels of office.</p> <p>While the FCO has yet to file its defence, the Guardian has seen a copy of its informal provisional position statement, dated 6 September 2013. In it, the FCO denies responsibility for actions of the colonial administration. Referencing the first Mau Mau case, the FCO argues that the claims brought in this second suit “are conspicuously weaker”.</p> <p>Lawyer Martyn Day, of Leigh Day, who orchestrated the 2013 settlement but is not involved in the second case, said: “It looks like the government has decided to batten down the hatches and fight them on the beaches and never surrender. Not surprising, when they’re facing so many cases.”</p> <p>Leigh Day’s case involved members of Mau Mau veterans associations.</p> <p>Lawyers for the claimants expect the FCO to plead limitation. In this event, they will ask the judge to use his discretion to exclude the time limit, using <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/33\" title=\"Limitations Act\">section 33 of the Limitations Act 1980</a>.</p> <p>In 2011, the FCO accepted that the Kenyans had been tortured, but it denied responsibility for the violence and later argued that the claims had expired.</p> <p>In two rulings in 2011 and 2012, Mr Justice McCombe dismissed the FCO’s objections on liability and limitation, though these rulings are non-binding.</p> <p>Tandem Law, a Manchester-based firm specialising in personal injury, began advertising for and registering new Kenyan claimants while the first case was under way. The firm represents 20,363 of the claimants, and is steering the case as lead solicitor.</p> <p>In Kenya, there have been claims that litigation has had some adverse effects. Lawyers at the Law Society of Kenya said a number of elderly people had been targeted by imposter lawyers, some claiming to represent British firms, and defrauded of savings.</p> <p>Kenyan media also report that the sudden influx of lawyers competing to sign up clients has caused confusion in some communities.</p> <p>Bickering between Mau Mau groups has also become commonplace.

As a nine-year old, and then again as an 18-year-old, she refused to undergo the tradition, a mandated rite of passage for girls from the Marakwet of Kenya. The Marakwet have long practised FGM to mark transition from girlhood to adulthood.</p> <p>Known as <em>kapkoro, </em>the ceremony involves cutting the clitoris, labia<em> </em>minora and labia majora. After undergoing the cut, nine- to 13-year-old girls remain in seclusion for a period during which older women teach them the traditions and secrets of the community. Thereafter, girls as young as 14 consider themselves adult women ready to get married and start a family. FGM has ushered them into a new social role.</p> <p> Our family’s abandonment came long before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/end-fgm\">global and national campaigns</a> against FGM took root. The abandonment didn’t even begin with the missionary-driven campaigns against the practice that punctuated the colonial period in Kenya. </p> <p>Instead, it began when my mother dreamed of owning a car to ease her household chores. She lived on top of the hills framing the Kerio valley and had to endure day-long journeys up and down the valley collecting salt licks for her family’s cows. What’s more, she grew up as the only girl in a family of six boys, and was required to shoulder the responsibilities of sisters who were never born. </p> <p> “My teacher told us that there are Luo ladies who drive cars and put men in jail,” my mother said of the dream that began to take shape. “He told us that Luo women were not circumcised.” </p> <p>Concluding that not being cut would grant her access to education and bring her closer to owning a car, she decided that she would not undergo FGM, even though she would be forever seen as a child in the community. It didn’t faze her. Education was more important. </p> <p>So, when she was nine, my mother cried when she was to undergo FGM. Culturally, it’s a bad omen if someone cries before undergoing the cut, so she was left alone.</p> <p>My mother left home to live with her eldest brother in Kakamega, a town in western Kenya, where she was forced to trade her studies for household chores and the care of her nephews and nieces. </p> <p>When she was 18, her family insisted that she ought to undergo the practice. As one of the oldest girls who remained uncut, she was preventing the younger girls in her clan from transitioning to women. What may have seemed a heroic stance against circumcision was fast becoming an embarrassment for her family.</p> <p>In a last resort to stop their insistence, my mother embarked on a 500km journey from Nairobi to the coastal city of Mombasa, threatening her family that they would never see her again if they forced her to be cut. Afraid for her life, they relented and allowed her back home – the first uncut woman among her contemporaries<em>. </em> </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>She did not hesitate in sacrificing her own social identity and acceptance to hold on to her educational dreams</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> As I grew up, I gradually came to understand the significance of my mother’s actions. She rejected circumcision in the 1970s, at a time when no one in her community had contemplated such an idea. She did not hesitate in sacrificing her own social identity and acceptance to hold on to her educational dreams.</p> <p>I grew up grateful for the wealth of possibilities her painful history opened up for me. I grew up eager to accord better opportunities to my own contemporaries – fellow girls whose mothers continue to subject them to the practice. Unfortunately, the rate of female circumcision among the Marakwet remains high. In many parts of the area, FGM is still considered a prerequisite for marriage and, for many girls, it also means an end to their schooling. Deeming themselves women, the girls abhor mingling with “children” in a classroom. </p> <p> Unlike many of these girls, I have been lucky to remain in the classroom. My mother broke away from tradition, giving me the freedom to define my femininity and cultural identity without the pressures of rooting them within a physical ceremony. </p> <p>I have attended school through to university without having to worry that <em>kapkoro</em> might cut short my dreams. My mother has given me the licence to dream. She has imbued me with the confidence of encouraging other girls to dream alternative futures that do not rely on FGM as a prerequisite. </p> <p>• <em>Miriam Jerotich is a writer and researcher from Kenya working at the <a href=\"http://accaf.uonbi.ac.ke/\">Africa Coordinating Center for the Abandonment of FGM/C</a> based at the University of Nairobi</em></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/feb/06/female-genital-mutilation-kenya-international-zero-day-of-tolerance-fgm","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/feb/06/female-genital-mutilation-kenya-international-zero-day-of-tolerance-fgm","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Connecting up the NFL: using technology to improve fan experience","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-29T15:26:35Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2015/jan/29/connectivity-data-nfl-superbowl-technology--fan-experience","fields":{"body":"<p>When you bring 70,000 sport fans together in one place you have some serious logistical considerations: traffic, parking, security and safety to name but a few. There are many potential frustrations from attending a major sporting event. But the frustration of physical mobility has been superseded by another kind of mobile frustration; the failure of the stadium’s wireless network from the sheer magnitude of connected devices that fans take to the big game.</p> <p>Like it or not, mobile has forever changed the face of attending sporting events. They are no longer a passive spectator endeavour. Fans expect to connect, share and engage as part of the game. When it works they are content, when it fails they are furious.</p> <p>Attending the recent Seattle Seahawks CIO summit, I caught up with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgewscott\">George Scott</a>, director of digital for the <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/\">National Football League</a> (NFL). Scott stated: “The fan experience is fundamentally changing.” Fans are engaged with the game, other spectators, services and friends “from the moment they leave their house, throughout the game, and until they get back home”. Connectivity is an essential part of game day.</p> <p>Scott went on to say: “If there is one thing fans want to do at a game it’s brag.” But with everyone posting their requisite selfie, vines and other updates to Facebook, Twitter and the raft of other social networks, all at the same time, there is potential for a serious infrastructure meltdown.</p> <p>In-stadium apps also add to the crushing burden on the wireless network. These in-stadium apps offer functionality from ordering a beer and a hot dog that can be delivered to your seat, to watching exclusive in stadium replays. There is a serious load on the wireless network at any given time.</p> <p>Luckily for spectators, the NFL has its eye on the ball (save for the ones the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/21/deflategate-nfl-finds-11-of-12-patriots-footballs-were-underinflated\">New England Patriots play with</a>). Most stadiums were built well before our current notion of mobile was even a glimmer in Steve Jobs’s eye. Many sport venues are woefully inadequate when it comes to being able to provide the most basic of wireless connectivity at the required capacity.</p> <p>The NFL, however is defining what it means to provide for the mobile game day experience. <a href=\"http://www.extremenetworks.com/\">Extreme Networks</a>, the official wireless and analytics provider of the NFL, will have served more than a million connected devices on its networks by the end of this NFL season. </p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ValaAfshar\">Vala Afshar</a>, CMO at Extreme Networks, gave me an insight into what game day volume looks like. An average of 15,000 sustained concurrent devices and more than a terabyte of data is transferred. Mobile is a pillar of the game day experience and, when done right, the fan experience takes on new dimensions.</p> <p>With the rise of high-definition televisions, the NFL recognises that it needs to entice fans to come to the stadium. Afshar notes: “The catalyst behind the digital transformation of the NFL is to improve the fan experience.” All these devices, uploads and replays need to happen in a seamless fashion or the fan experience will be severely degraded. Extreme’s <a href=\"http://www.extremenetworks.com/product/purview\">analytics</a> give the NFL the ability to measure response times, optimise wireless signals, and predict fan behaviour. “The NFL uses data to improve fan experience.” This, in return, improves the fan.</p> <p>Last week, both the NFL conference championship games were held in <a href=\"http://www.extremenetworks.com/case-studies/pervasive-wi-fi-for-gillette-stadium-delivers-a-unique-game-day-experience-for-patriots-fans\">Extreme Network-powered stadiums</a>. And the company will also be the wireless and analytics provider for the biggest occasion in US sports, the <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/49\">Super Bowl</a>.</p> <p>Afshar continues: “This is why you see NFL teams focused on fan experience investing in infrastructure. The NFL views their network infrastructure as a business asset; it’s not just plumbing, it can’t be. The fans demand more and the NFL is responding.” Bandwidth is growing exponentially and stadiums in the NFL are trying to get ahead of that curve. As Scott says: “trying to future proof it”. <br /></p> <p>Afshar went on to say: “The level of digital thought leadership that exists in the NFL is pretty incredible.” This digital thought leadership is having a big impact on the evolving nature of what a digital experience means as an integral part of the game, on how one can be a better fan. <br /></p> <p>“The best game experience is personal,” Scott said, “It’s different for every person.” He noted that in the past the NFL delivered a linear experience for all the fans; one app experience across the board, but now “choosing your own consumption is what it needs to be”. This is where the NFL is going to push the digital curve.</p> <p>Is the NFL creating better fans? Does all this connectivity actually have an impact? It does seem quite coincidental that both teams appearing in the Super Bowl this year, the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots, have a reputation for delivering first in class mobile experiences to their demanding fans.</p> <p>The Seattle Seahawks’ fans, also known as the 12s, are regarded as some of the most connected and raucous fans in sport today. Their effect on the opposing team, as well as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_Quake\">measured seismic activity</a>, is a phenomenon recognised around the league. The fan impact on the game is regularly taken into account for game day preparations by the opposing team. <br /></p> <p>Afshar told me that Seahawks’ fans have also achieved the most used bandwidth of any team. The best teams seem to have the best connected fans, and the NFL is making strides towards ensuring fans’ digital needs are provided for, keeping them active and engaged. </p> <p><em>Benjamin Robbins is a co-founder at <a href=\"http://palador.com/\">Palador</a>, a mobile consultancy located in Seattle, WA.

And how can you use data to inform better decision-making and improve consumers’ real-life experiences?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q31IRTwk4rM\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q31IRTwk4rM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Future technology at CES 2015</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Responsive environments</h2> <p>Enabling these more connected, personalised ways of living are what some commentators are calling “responsive” environments. These are the screens, sensors and digital interfaces that are becoming commonplace everywhere around us. From the living room to the bathroom, the car to the sidewalk – screens, wireless networks and sensors will be accessible everywhere. </p> <p>Ultimately, screens and sensors will be built into walls and into the very structure of our lives to create frictionless and integrated ambient experiences. Our surrounding spaces will become more personalised, automatically optimising audio, temperature, light, messages and more based upon our individual needs.</p> <h2>Alternate and enhanced realities</h2> <p>This is about blending the physical and digital worlds to enhance life experiences. Whereas virtual reality (VR) is a fully 360-degree immersive view of an alternate world, augmented reality is an added layer of relevant content that doesn’t replace the real world that you experience. These technologies will ultimately merge into one to create more immersive storytelling and learning experiences. No longer is this about gaming; enhanced realities are impacting areas such as retail and travel, enabling shoppers to 3D-visualise and customise product choices or potential travel destinations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2014/oct/27/sensory-marketing-brands-senses-technology\">Sensory marketing: the brands appealing to all five senses</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Content as currency</h2> <p>In 2015 and beyond we will also see the fusion of content with tech to connect to people’s passion points. Whether it’s higher fidelity systems, 3D, 4k, live streaming, user-generated or brand-created, content is what differentiates a commodity product from a meaningful experience. Brands, tech and media companies will need to collaborate more to find new talent, new models of working and new ways of connecting with consumers through quality, modular content.</p> <h2>New mobility</h2> <p>This will be a big area of interest for many public-facing industries, such as commerce, automotive, retail, travel and creative production. New technologies such as drones, electric scooters, autonomous cars, robotic helpers and automatic bikes are enabling more versatile ways of moving, managing and exploring remote spaces. </p> <p>Location-based marketing will be critical to this, as marketers look for new ways to reach people on the go. This may be through video, global positioning system notifications, sponsored routes, targeted coupons and offers, digital signage or mobile commerce.</p> <p>In this new world of mobility, VR and custom connectivity, the future of marketing and media looks exciting. Technology alone will not deliver meaningful impact for consumers, but with smart use of content and data, along with a true consumer-centric mindset, we can succeed in creating meaningful connections. </p> <p><em>Rori DuBoff is global head of strategy at Havas Media Group</em></p> <p><em><strong>This advertisement feature is provided by </strong><a href=\"http://www.havasmedia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Havas Media Group</strong></a><strong>, sponsors of the Guardian Media Network’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/series/organic-marketing\">Organic marketing hub</a>.</strong></em></p> <p><em><br /></em></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/havas-media-group-partner-zone/2015/jan/27/new-technology-meaningful-brand-ces-2015","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media-network/havas-media-group-partner-zone/2015/jan/27/new-technology-meaningful-brand-ces-2015","sectionName":"Havas Media Group partner zone"},{"webTitle":"Marketing and PR Excellence 2014: Peppermint Technology","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-06T10:13:41Z","sectionId":"small-business-network","id":"small-business-network/2014/nov/06/showcase-marketing-pr-peppermint-technology","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name:</strong> Peppermint Technology Ltd<br /><strong>City:</strong> Nottingham<br /><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.pepperminttechnology.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.pepperminttechnology.co.uk</a></p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Peppermint Technology brought its legal service - a legal software product that offers all the services a legal provider needs in one application platform - to market in January 2013.</p><p>As a startup business operating in a highly competitive market, Peppermint had the challenge of building a brand while generating business leads with minimal budget.

The Peppermint Research Forum attracted more than 100 attendees from 50 prospect law firms. Held with Microsoft, at its Customer Briefing Centre in London, the event gave Peppermint 50 sales leads, credibility, profile and the global clout to compete against others in the market.

But mobile is arguably having a much bigger impact on people's lives in the developing world, particularly Africa. There, the transformative effect of a technology that is largely taken for granted in the UK, such as an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">e-reader application</a>, can be immense. That transformation was the subject of a recent presentation by mobile strategist Rudy De Waele at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.campus-party.eu/2013/Whats_on_at_Campus_Party.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">O2 Campus Party</a> at London's O2 Arena, a week long technology festival.</p><p>\"People in Sub-Saharan countries have to deal with very basic kinds of infrastructural problems in transport, electricity generation or water supply, things that most of us in the West don't have to deal with\" says De Waele.</p><p>De Waele is the co-founder of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nyotamedia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nyota Media</a>, an agency dedicated to assisting African entrepreneurs and startups using technology to improve the lives of Africans. Based in London, Nyota works with a range of companies, including Microsoft, IBM and Millicom. De Waele has over 18 years experience in internet technology, and has specialised in mobile innovation since 1999. He says there are huge opportunities in Africa right now when it comes to mobile solutions generally.</p><p>\"Over the next five years, seven of the world's ten fastest growing economies will come out of Africa. As a result, there is a growing middle class in Sub-Saharan parts of the continent, mainly in places like Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania. There's also faster growing access to mobile connectivity. The market is still largely feature phone based, but smartphone penetration is growing rapidly. These are beginning to be offered at a cost of between $50 and $70.\"</p><p>Internet connectivity is only part of the explanation for the growth in social entrepreneurship however. A crucial factor, says De Waele, is that many African countries have a very young population.</p><p>\"In some countries over 50% of the population is below the age of 20. As a result, there is a young, dynamic generation - I call them the 'wow generation' - that have their own ideas on how to change things for themselves, and that are no longer waiting for the West to come and save them. Through the internet they have access to any type of knowledge, as well as things like crowdfunding platforms and technology hubs. This allows them to avoid the bureaucracy of corrupted government or big industry players, and come up with low cost solutions to a range of problems.\"</p><p>One such example here is Kenya's <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-pesa\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-Pesa</a>, a mobile money solution that allows Kenyans to transfer money via their mobile phone. M-Pesa has surged in popularity since 2007, with almost 20 million accounts having been opened in country with a population of some 44 million people. A more recent example of how falling costs have combined with increased device mobility is the Happy Feet project. The brainchild of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/53013050\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Nairobi student Roy Ombatti</a>, this uses 3D printing to create custom shaped shoes for victims of the Chigoea flea. Commonly referred to as 'Jigger disease', the flea can leave those it infects with severe, painful deformations of the feet.</p><p>The innovative use of technology in this way and the capacity for self sufficiency it creates, is a key feature of social entrepreneurship in Africa says De Waele. He also thinks it marks the death knell for the \"old\" not for profit model of fundraising and distribution.</p><p>\"In a global context, and especially in Europe, I think the old not for profit model of raising funds to distribute to other people is dead, or is dying. Big NGOs need huge marketing campaigns and that is a huge overhead. It doesn't really work anymore. With access to the internet and crowdfunding, people can choose what they want to fund. Of course it's a good thing that big NGO's do things like distribute food, but in the end they aren't helping efforts to make people self-sufficient, by growing their own food for example.\"</p><p>De Waele says that communications companies like O2 have an important role to play in all of this, certainly by continuing to provide internet access, but also by helping to develop a supportive ecosystem by \"connecting entrepreneurs, investors, business and mentors through programmes or hubs.\" &nbsp;</p><p>\"Whether Latin America or Africa, the problems and solutions are the same. When I talk to local developers, they all tell me they can learn to do things like code online, but what they really want is advice on how to set up a sustainable businesses. There's not a lot of experience in that regard, particularly when it comes to things like energy and development of natural resources. Programmes such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wayra.org/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wayra</a>, that combine all of these elements and connect them with investment, are crucial to future success.\"</p><p><strong>Content managed by O2.</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network-partner-zone-o2/mobile-technology-social-entrepreneurship","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/social-enterprise-network-partner-zone-o2/mobile-technology-social-entrepreneurship","sectionName":"Social Enterprise Network partner zone - O2"},{"webTitle":"Africa embassy bombings: attacks that propelled Bin Laden into the limelight","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-20T06:01:04Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2015/jan/20/africa-embassy-bombings-osama-bin-laden-kenya-tanzania-al-qaida","fields":{"body":"<p>When news broke of the double bombings in east Africa, it was not just western security services that suddenly began to take Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida group seriously. Many within the Islamist militant movement were impressed.</p> <p>Until that moment, Bin Laden had been seen as something of a dilettante, a rich young man who had never experienced first-hand the tough, day-to-day battle in streets, safe houses and cells across the Middle East that Islamist militancy had meant until that point.</p> <p>The Saudi-born organiser and propagandist had of course seen action during the 1979-89 war against the Soviets in Afghanistan, but then so had thousands of other young men from across the Islamic world. When many veterans of that fight went on to spearhead brutal campaigns of violence in countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Jordan or Pakistan, Bin Laden went home to Jeddah and then into a relatively comfortable, safe exile in an Islamist-friendly Sudan.</p> <p>But the east African attacks “made a lot of people sit up and take notice”, said one Libyan veteran activist four years after the strikes.</p> <p>Founded in Pakistan in the late 1980s, al-Qaida had long been a marginal group without significant resources, manpower or an obvious strategy. The highest profile terrorist attacks of the 1990s – on the World Trade Center in 1993, in Saudi Arabia and in Pakistan – had been the work of other groups.</p> <p>Bin Laden had been tangentially linked to a strike on a hotel used by US servicemen in Yemen, and to violence in Somalia, but nothing else. His tirades against the west and calls for every Muslim to attack US citizens and interests wherever they could be found, issued after his return to Afghanistan in 1996, were controversial even within his own organisation, as one forthcoming memoir by a militant makes clear.</p> <p>All that changed in 1998 with the East African bombings. In their aftermath, the Clinton administration launched cruise missiles on poorly selected targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.</p> <p>The ill-judged response to the bombings made the Taliban, who had been initially wary of the extremist Arabs living in territory they had recently conquered, more sympathetic towards Bin Laden and his global agenda. This removed a key obstacle to further, more ambitious attacks.</p> <p>The strikes, especially when followed by the attack on the guided-missile destroyer USS Cole off Yemen in 2000, also allowed Bin Laden and his group to claim leadership of the fragmented militant movement. They became a favourite destination for volunteers, donations and, crucially, groups from all over the Islamic world seeking assistance with projects of their own. This laid the basis for the network of networks – the affiliates – that are still so important today.</p> <p>The East African bombings also popularised the new conception of a conflict no longer limited by territorial boundaries. In the new globalised world of the late 1990s, with its satellite TV news channels, cheap flights, relatively open borders and nascent internet, this broader vision simply made more sense to aspirant militants from Morocco to Malaysia than the parochial vision of other groups active at the time.</p> <p>The local struggles they had waged had all failed miserably, crushed by repressive authorities or undermined by flagging public support amid chaotic and apparently indiscriminate violence against other Muslims.</p> <p>From the embassies in Africa, theoretically US sovereign territory, to an attack on a US warship at sea, to bombing the US in the “homeland” itself was an inevitable progression. We are still living with the consequences today.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/20/africa-embassy-bombings-osama-bin-laden-kenya-tanzania-al-qaida","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jan/20/africa-embassy-bombings-osama-bin-laden-kenya-tanzania-al-qaida","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Woolwich murder: what drove two men to kill a soldier in the street?","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-19T12:48:43Z","sectionId":"uk-news","id":"uk-news/2013/dec/19/woolwich-murder-soldier-street-adebolajo-radicalised-kenya","fields":{"body":"<p>As the nightmare first seconds of Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale's attack on Lee Rigby unfolded, there was a sign before them of how far they had strayed from their adopted religion.</p><p>They believed murdering a British soldier would please Allah and be a strike against the foreign policy of the west. They drove a car into Rigby, catapulting him on to the bonnet.</p><p>To the zealots, Rigby was an enemy they were about to behead. To Saraj Miah, a Muslim man who happened to be nearby and was wearing a white prayer cap as a sign of his devoutness, he was a human being in desperate trouble.</p><p>Miah had been smoking a cigarette outside a shop in Woolwich, south London, when he saw Adebolajo get out of his car with a cleaver in his hand and slash at the neck of a man on the ground, as Adebowale stabbed at the body. Miah was the first person to try to save Rigby, shouting \"don't kill him\" at the attackers. To ward Miah off, one aimed a gun at him, forcing him to back away.</p><p>How Adebolajo and Adebowale became radicalised to the point that they wanted to butcher a man in broad daylight did not form part of the court case. But it is the crucial issue facing the government, the counter-terrorism establishment and communities across Britain, an issue they have been grappling with since the modern age of terrorism began in the mass bloodshed of the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001.</p><p>Adebolajo and Adebowale are the first terrorists in Britain inspired by al-Qaida to plot murder, kill their victim and survive to answer questions. From a search for what drove them emerges a complex mix of a battle to control Islamic teaching, extremists in Britain and Africa, the internet, the attackers' personalities and how they interpret the modern world around them.</p><p>The story of Rigby's murderers shows that the ideology of violent jihad retains the power to capture young Britons and render them capable of savage acts of which they are proud.</p><p>After the murder Adebolajo and Adebowale did not attempt to flee but remained at the scene and tried to turn modern technology – smartphones with cameras – into a tool of propaganda. They posed for pictures before Adebolajo talked into cameras and justified the slaughter, his hands covered in blood from his victim.</p><p>Then Adebolajo, 29, and Adebowale, 22, rushed armed officers as they arrived, brandishing their knives and cleaver and an unloaded gun. They claimed they wanted the officers to shoot them dead and thus make them martyrs. They were shot and wounded, detained and taken to hospital. During police interviews and then before the jury that convicted him, Adebolajo said he had picked his target at random, viewed himself as a soldier and calculated the degree of suffering to inflict on his victim.</p><p>On his first day of police interviews, Adebolajo explained how he and Adebowale had driven to the barracks in Woolwich in a Vauxhall Tigra on 22 May. The day before he had bought knives from an Argos store and a knife sharpener. Adebolajo told detectives they were determined to stun and then murder a soldier – any soldier – because he was \"the most fair target because he joins the army with kind of an understanding that your life is at risk\".</p><p>He added that they attacked Rigby – who was returning to the Woolwich barracks from a recruitment fair, dressed in a Help for Heroes sweatshirt – because \"it just so happened that he was the soldier that was spotted first\".</p><p>At times during the interviews Adebolajo wrapped himself in a light blue blanket taken from his cell, because he felt cold. Speaking in a matter-of-fact way, he said: \"It was almost as if Allah had chosen him … when I thought about obeying Allah in the past I thought maybe it is possible to kill a man by driving into him.</p><p>\"When he crossed the road in front of me … it was almost as if I was not in control of myself.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384293'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387446824013/Adebolajo-in-a-blue-blank-011.jpg' alt='Adebolajo in a blue blanket' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Michael Adebolajo wrapped in a blue blanket during a police interview after the killing. Photograph: Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>\"I accelerated. I hit him and I think I crashed into a signpost. We wished to fulfil our promise to Allah. We did not wish to give him much pain.</p><p>\"I could see he was still alive … we exited the vehicle and I am not sure how I struck the first blow … the most humane way to kill any creature is to cut the jugular … he may be my enemy but he is a man … so I struck at the neck and attempted to remove the head.\"</p><p>Adebolajo has been assessed as being sane before his interviews, with no history of mental problems. The video images of Adebolajo at the scene at first seemed to show someone out of control. But the truth may be even worse: that his thinking was warped into believing his adopted religion allowed him to decide all the world was a battlefield and that he was entitled to kill a soldier.</p><p>Other terrorists who have attacked in Britain wanted to kill as many civilians as possible; Adebolajo and Adebowale had decided to target one soldier.</p><p>Rigby, 25, who was from Middleton, Greater Manchester, was the father of a two-year-old boy, Jack. He had served in Afghanistan and was described by senior officers as a \"professional and incredibly brave\" soldier who had faced gun battles with insurgents and patrols at risk of improvised explosive devices.</p><p>Off duty and returning to barracks after the recruitment fair at Tower Bridge, he can have had no idea of the horror that awaited him as he turned on to Wellington Street. In the dreadful moments after the attack one woman at the scene asked Adebolajo if he was going to harm the passersby. Adebolajo said: \"No, the women and children are safe. You need to keep back when the police and the soldiers get here.\"</p><p>He gave the warning because he and Adebowale planned to rush at armed police, who were then arriving, while brandishing a gun and knives, hoping to be shot dead.</p><p>The British academic Paul Gill, who has studied terrorists for a US government study, said they may have chosen to be discriminate in their target because they believed it would make it \"more difficult to paint their actions as the work of 'madmen' or 'lunatic extremists'\".</p><p>Adebolajo thought of himself as a soldier. Despite his arrest, after his video confession, after being shot, and despite his detention, he thought he could still be in control. He ignored legal advice to say nothing and refused to talk to detectives if he did not like their attitude.</p><p>While Adebolajo was in hospital he had a standoff with police. He wanted to wash his hands, which were covered with the blood of his victim, but officers wanted to take forensic samples to help establish his guilt. Adebolajo told police: \"I'm not going to deny anything.\"</p><p></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384294'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/18/1387397691600/Lee-Rigby--011.jpg' alt='Lee Rigby\r' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Lee Rigby was returning from a recruitment event when he was killed. Photograph: MoD/PA</figcaption></figure><h2>The young Muslim convert </h2><p>Adebolajo was the dominant of the two attackers. He was born on 2 December 1984 to a Nigerian Christian family. His mother was a social worker, his father a psychiatric nurse manager in the NHS. The upbringing was strict, and his parents placed great emphasis on education.</p><p></p><p>Discipline did not stop the young Adebolajo going off the rails. His mother moved her family out of Romford, Essex, to Lincolnshire in an attempt to remove him from the influence of a street gang after he started getting into trouble. But her son returned to the capital to go to Greenwich University, where poor performance led to him dropping out of the course by his third year.</p><p>He had become interested in Islam and converted in his first year at university. The extremist cleric <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/24/woolwich-murder-influence-preacher-suspect-adebolajo\" title=\"\">Omar Bakri Mohammad</a> said he tutored Adebolajo in Islam after his conversion in 2003. Bakri Mohammad was the former leader of al-Muhajiroun, an organisation banned for professing extremist views. Several al-Muhajiroun followers have gone on to be convicted of terrorist offences in Britain.</p><p>Mohammad described Adebolajo as a shy man who had been angered by the Iraq invasion, and who would ask questions about when violence was justified. \"He asked these types of questions, like many others,\" said Bakri Mohammed. \"He was asking what to do. He was most likely affected by the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"</p><p>Bakri Mohammed, now banned from Britain, said that as a new convert, Adebolajo received special attention: \"In 2004 Muslims were feeling a lot of pressures from new laws and from Iraq.\"</p><p>Adebolajo frequently attended the group's protests. At one such demonstration he was arrested and subsequently convicted in 2006. He was also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/26/woolwich-attack-michael-adebolajo\" title=\"\">photographed at a protest outside Paddington Green police station</a> in 2007, and led some of the group's protests.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384295'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387449489128/Adebolajo-at-2007-protest-011.jpg' alt='Adebolajo at 2007 protest' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Adebolajo at a protest outside Paddington Green police station in 2007. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</figcaption></figure><p>He appears to have later attended events organised by successor groups to al-Muhajiroun until around 2011. By 2012 he claimed to have left the group.</p><p>Adebolajo fathered six children, the last born four days before Rigby's murder. He was well-read and described as pleasant by some who knew him, but with a temper. There were signs of an emerging mindset of a man attracted to the militant end of Islam from his association with Bakri Mohammed.</p><p>Adebolajo adopted a Muslim name, Mujaahid, which means one who engages in jihad. In court he renamed himself in honour of Abu Hamza, the extremist cleric <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/abu-hamza-loses-extradition-appeal\" title=\"\">extradited to the US last year</a>, and asked to be known as Mujaahid Abu Hamza.</p><p>Gill said: \"Not one of these behaviours could predict his eventual violent attack but together they tell a story of an individual becoming more deeply entrenched in militant activism.\"</p><h2>Kenya </h2><p>Adebolajo's friends say that in around 2010 he was receiving approaches from the domestic security service, MI5, asking him for information about his fellow extremists. That year Adebolajo travelled to Kenya. Some friends and family say the reason was to start a new life and to escape MI5 harassment. Others believe he was following a path trodden numerous times by jihadi wannabes. Kenya is the gateway to the lawless spaces of Somalia and the terrorist group al-Shabaab. The available evidence points to increasing radicalism being his reason for the journey.</p><p>For the west, the fight against extremism in east Africa is taken so seriously that Britain funded the construction and equipment for a Kenyan police centre as a base for anti-terrorism operations. The country receives money from the US to combat violent extremism.</p><p>Soon after arriving in Kenya Adebolajo ended up alongside people and in places associated with some of the leading al-Qaida-inspired terrorists in the region. He entered Kenya on 21 October 2010 on a scheduled flight to Nairobi. A man fitting his description was seen visiting a Mombasa mosque, Masjid Mussa, frequented by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/kenya-mall-siege-british-samantha-lewthwaite\" title=\"\">Samantha Lewthwaite</a>, the so-called white widow, a wanted in Kenya for alleged links to terror offences. The green and white mosque on Mwambundu Road is one of the focuses for radical Islam in the city.</p><p>The main attraction at Friday prayers in 2010 was Sheikh Aboud Rogo Mohammed, a radical preacher who had amassed a significant following with outspoken sermons in support of al-Qaida and its Horn of Africa affiliate al-Shabaab. He was the ideological leader of al-Hijra, a Kenyan affiliate of al-Shabaab, named in intelligence reports as being responsible, along with al-Shabaab, for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks\" title=\"\">Westgate shopping mall attack</a> in September this year that killed at least 67 people.</p><p>Aboud Rogo's Friday sermons featured regular calls for Muslims from Kenya and elsewhere to travel to Somalia and join al-Shabaab in their jihad against foreign forces. Today, Aboud Rogo is Mombasa's most famous Islamist martyr. In August 2012 he was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19390888\" title=\"\">killed</a> in a drive-by shooting.</p><p>The Mussa mosque is likely to be where Adebolajo met Swaleh Abdul Majid, a young man who would in 2011 marry the daughter of Aboud Rogo.</p><p>On 20 November 2010 Adebolajo caught a bus north out of Mombasa towards Lamu, a chain of tropical islands fringed with mangrove forests near the border with Somalia. The archipelago's remoteness has made it a staging post in reaching Somalia for al-Shabaab's recruitment network. Aboard the bus were five others, including the future son-in-law of Aboud Rogo, and four boys in their late teens. The group hired a speedboat to take them an hour's ride north to Pate Island and the remote village of Faza. Pate island was the home of al-Qaida's then leader in east Africa, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed.</p><p>Adebolajo and his companions arrived at 8pm and stayed at the basic Faza guesthouse. At first light the party moved on to Kizingitini, a nearby island that locals said was the launching point for the crossing to Somalia.</p><p>It was there that they were arrested by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/19/kenya-human-rights-anti-terror-police-killings\" title=\"\">Kenya's controversial anti-terror police unit </a>(ATPU), with the apparent assistance of a foreign intelligence service. The arresting officer, Inspector Stephen Khamisi, later told the magistrate that the ATPU had received outside intelligence reports leading them to intercept the group. Nine men were arrested and transferred to Mombasa. At the arraignment hearing held on 23 November 2010 they were accused of being on their way to Somalia and remanded in custody to allow police time for further investigation.</p><p>Court papers obtained by the Guardian show that by a second hearing four days later, names of four of the nine people remanded in custody had disappeared from the court record, including that of Adebolajo.</p><p>The conduct of the original hearing, as well as statements made in the dock and subsequent testimony, have given rise to two competing theories concerning Adebolajo, his travel companions and the role of the British high commission in obtaining his release. The first theory is that Adebolajo was planted on the bus to infiltrate a group of would-be militants, and that he was not meant to be detained. Certainly, the Kenyan government believed his arrest and return to the UK was not meant to be public.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384296'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387450034663/Video-grab-taken-from-ITV-007.jpg' alt='Video grab taken from ITV News of Michael Adebolajo with bloody hands holding a weapon at the scene ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Michael Adebolajo with bloody hands at the scene in Woolwich. Photograph: ITV</figcaption></figure><p>The second theory is that the Briton was a budding jihadist whose radicalism was further inflamed by mistreatment during his three days in custody. Aboubakar, a local lawyer retained by a Mombasa sheikh on behalf of the parents of three of the younger boys in the arrested group, said there had been serious concerns that they could be tortured by the ATPU.</p><p>He said the boys told him there was \"more than one white man present at the arrests\". At his court appearance the Briton was caught on video saying: \"These people are mistreating us and we are innocent, believe me.\"</p><p>Both theories of Adebolajo's intent in Lamu and his treatment in Kenyan custody rely on the contradictory testimony of his fellow detainee Swaleh. Now in hiding as he claims to be at risk of assassination, he has variously told relatives that he did not know Adebolajo before boarding the bus with him for Lamu and that he was \"suspicious\" of the foreigner; and that the pair became acquainted on the bus and quickly decided to travel together.</p><p>Another radical cleric, Abubakar Shariff, who has taken up the mantle of the murdered Aboud Rogo and Ibrahim Omar, says Swaleh told him privately that Adebolajo had been threatened with sexual assault while in the custody of the ATPU. He said the Briton had been stripped and threatened with rape with the muzzle of an AK-47. But Kenya's coastal province police chief, Aggrey Adoli, denied all allegations of mistreatment or torture, saying: \"The police do not abuse suspects.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the ATPU, Boniface Mwaniki, said the Briton was \"deported\" on 26 November. However, Kenyan immigration officials have privately contradicted this account, claiming he left on a commercial flight and his passport was not stamped with an order forbidding any re-entry to the country – standard practice in the event of deportation.</p><h2>Returning home </h2><p>On his return to the UK, Adebolajo claimed to friends and family that his harassment by MI5 continued as intelligence officers pressed him to be an informer. According to family members he told of being beaten and threatened with sexual violence and death. His family say he returned to the UK a changed and embittered man.</p><p>In 2012 Adebolajo and his family went to a group called CagePrisoners to complain about his treatment. His brother, Jeremiah, who was working at a university in Saudi Arabia, claimed he had been approached and pressured by MI6 for information.</p><p>Adebolajo said there was British complicity in his ill-treatment in Kenya. He confided in a friend, talking of abuse at the hands of the Kenyans. He also claimed that on 12-13 March 2012 an MI5 agent had met him in central London. According to a CagePrisoners note, Adebolajo said the agent pressed him to work for MI5, and sent several text messages to keep up the pressure. The last one read: \"We have no option but to proceed without you.\"</p><p>MI5 is also alleged to have pressured other family members to use their influence to get Adebolajo to co-operate with the security service.</p><p>A friend who cannot be named for legal reasons said Adebolajo became radicalised in late 2012. The friend saw profound changes in his character, which he attributed to his experiences in Kenya and on his return to Britain. Adebolajo had described to his friend how during interrogation \"they told him: 'You are not in the UK now.' They took his private parts and said we will F-you [sic]. He told me he was physically assaulted and sexually threatened. If you looked at his face, he was holding back tears,\" the friend said.</p><p>When Adebolajo returned to England he was interviewed by MI5 officers. The friend said: \"His whole concept was he wanted to live in a Muslim land because at the time he was being harassed by MI5. They were knocking and knocking on his door. He pretended not to be there but then he spoke to the agent. They said we just want to speak to you and they wanted to ask him if he knew certain people.\" The friend said he believed Adebolajo declined MI5's offer. \"His word was: 'They are bugging me,'\" he said.</p><p>Less than a year before the attack, Asim Qureshi from CagePrisoners saw Adebolajo, and his sister Blessing. Their main concern was alleged threats from the security services to their brother Jeremiah. Qureshi said he was struck by how in control of himself Adebolajo was and also by how lucid he was.</p><p>Adebolajo said he had been in al-Muhajiroun, but had left feeling a spiritual element was missing.</p><p>There is one report placing Adebolajo as a regular volunteer at an extremist stall outside a bank in Woolwich High Street handing out Islamist propaganda in the runup to the murder. One witness said he had been seen outside Plumstead community centre encouraging people to fight in Syria.</p><p>But the week before the attack should have been one of joy for Adebolajo. His wife gave birth to a son, his sixth child. Instead, he and Adebowale were planning the attack on a soldier, with CCTV recovered by the police investigation showing the purchase of knives for use in the attack.</p><h2>Adebowale </h2><p>Adebolajo was the dominant one of the killers. Adebowale, from Greenwich, south London, was also a convert to Islam who had attended rallies held by successor groups to al-Muhajiroun. He attended one outside the US embassy in London as recently as September 2012.</p><p>Adebowale, who brandished a gun at police, had his thumb shot off by an armed officer.</p><p>Police do not know how the two men met, although they believe the pair attended various mosques in south London. One attended a community centre in Greenwich which held prayer sessions.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384297'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387449588770/A-man-contemplates-at-a-s-006.jpg' alt='A man contemplates at a scene where flowers lay outside Woolwich Barracks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Flowers left outside Woolwich barracks.

He showed an interest in studying at a community college in Greenwich, but never enrolled.</p><p>Like his accomplice, he was in trouble with the police as a youth. Adebowale is suspected of being a former member of a London street gang and in 2008 was sentenced to 15 months in prison for involvement in drugs supply.</p><p>He dabbled in supplying minor drugs and ran away from home on at least two occasions. He spent four days in Feltham young offender institution.</p><p>As a teenager, Adebowale witnessed a murder and in January 2008, when he was 16, he was stabbed in a frenzied attack in which one person died. The incident gives an insight into a life in chaos.</p><p>Faridon Alizada, 18, was \"literally cut to pieces\" by an assailant wielding a 12-inch knife, according to the judge at the trial that followed the incident on a housing estate in Erith, south-east London. Lee James, 32, was convicted of murdering Alizada, stabbing a 16-year-old in the neck, and stabbing Adebowale in the shoulder and hand.</p><p>The trial at Southwark crown court heard that James, a former bare-knuckle fighter, accused Adebowale and the other youths, who were Afghans, of being members of al-Qaida and plotting to carry out explosions. The court heard claims that James was suffering from drug-induced psychosis during the attack.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384298'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387450136155/High-security-armed-Met-p-006.jpg' alt='High security armed Met police convoy arrival of both Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale to Old' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Adebolajo and Adebowale arrive at the Old Bailey during the trial in a high-security armed Met police convoy. Photograph: Guy Corbishley/Demotix/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>A Greenwich neighbour said that after the attack Adebowale disappeared for a year and converted to Islam, and that his character appeared to have changed.</p><p>Madeleine Edwards, a family friend who lived in the same block of flats as Adebowale in Greenwich, said he had been involved with a local gang – the Woolwich boys – when he was a young teenager and had been in \"some serious gangland trouble\".</p><p>She claimed his mother had said he had to \"disappear for a while\". He left for about a year and on his return was a convert to Islam and had become distant.</p><p>Adebowale suffered psychological problems from the attack, with psychologists who assessed him during the trial saying he still heard the voice of his attacker. His mental health problems had been exacerbated by the excessive smoking of skunk, a strong form of cannabis. Adebowale's mental health led to the trial being delayed and, as it deteriorated during the hearing, the decision was made that he could not testify in his own defence.</p><p>Adebowale suffered from psychotic episodes during his time in custody and, it is believed, heard voices beforehand. One spoke to him in a Nigerian accent and would predict what he was about to do next, he told psychiatrists, such as predicting he would brush his teeth.</p><p>He had episodes of hallucinations that left him out of touch with reality.</p><p>Adebowale had psychotic symptoms before the attack, and psychiatrists said he felt his religion protected him, or at least lessened the terrifying effects of the psychosis.</p><p>At times he believed spirits called Djinns would make him do things and were \"playing with him\". One psychiatrist said it was a way for Adebowale to rationalise his symptoms as he complained the Djinns were changing words on paper as he tried to read them.</p><p>In one evaluation, Dr Phillip Joseph, who assessed him for the Crown, said Adebowale hinted the Djinns were \"partly responsible\" for his involvement in the attack, and then backtracked.</p><p>He feared the Djinns could travel and might hurt his mother.</p><p>The psychiatrist Neil Boast said that during an assessment on 11 November Adebowale said he was a Christian and not a Muslim.</p><p>His police interviews were not admitted as evidence. Though he was assessed as fit to be interviewed, the judge decided he had been too unwell. One source with knowledge of the interviews described him as \"bouncing off the walls\", and saying bizarre things. In his first interview Adebowale lashed out at detectives, spitting on them, before being physically restrained.</p><p>In the weeks before the attack the two men were in frequent contact. Extremist material was recovered from their homes, including sermons from Anwar al-Awlaki, one of most effective propagators of the al-Qaida-inspired message on the web. The extremist material found was still available on YouTube as Adebolajo and Adebowale stood trial.</p><p></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384299'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387447069854/Adebolajo-and-Adebowale-a-011.jpg' alt='Adebolajo and Adebowale at scene' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Adebowale, left, and Adebolajo at the scene.

How things have changed. As part of <a href=\"http://www.skillsforcare.org.uk\">Skills for Care</a>’s ongoing work looking at digital capabilities in the adult social care sector, a research team asked over 500 managers and staff in adult social care services about their digital capabilities, experiences and attitudes. Our results showed that more than 95% used digital technology in their work, and the great majority are strongly positive about the potential of digital technology to improve efficiency and quality of care services.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, digital technologies are most commonly used in business administration and communications. However, technology is also significantly impacting the delivery of care and support services. Three-quarters of organisations use digital technologies to plan and record services, and more than half use them directly with the people they support. They’re used to enhance communication between service users and their family and friends, to organise leisure activities for service users, and to help people plan their own care and support.</p> <p>One residential care home we visited has an all-encompassing digital reporting system, which has transformed the workplace. “Throughout the home we’ve got 10-inch tablet computers mounted on the wall and all information gets entered into them,” says the manager of the home. “There’s very little in terms of paperwork now. We use the tablets for care plans, risk assessments, health assessments, safeguarding, medication – everything, really. From the moment a resident gets up in the morning to when they go to bed, it’s documented on the system in real time.” </p> <p>Staff, even those who had been nervous when the system was introduced, are all in agreement. “The only negative thing would be if I left this job and had to go back to a paper-based system,” says one employee.</p> <p>Mainstream cloud-based services such as Google Docs and social media are embedded in the sector: “Digital media is a natural part of everything we do,” says the manager of an organisation providing residential support for people with autism. “We use Google Docs for administration, and Facebook for communication. We have over 12,000 likes on our Facebook page. It’s how we get our message out into the world and it’s our main recruitment tool.”</p> <p>The organisation also uses Facebook as a reporting tool – support workers post about the day’s leisure activities for the residents, so families and friends can get an idea of what their loved ones are doing. Families are very positive about this use of social media, but there are problems communicating with the local authority: “Social workers can’t access Facebook or use Google Docs because of the IT restrictions at the local authority. So we have to send them things as email attachments, which is pretty frustrating.”</p> <p>Our research showed that constraints around local authority IT systems were one of the challenges of digital development, but the most frequently cited barrier for care providers overall was the cost of digital devices and internet connectivity. Services with mobile workforces were also extremely limited by poor broadband coverage.</p> <p>Another limitation cited by managers was staff digital skills – though this was disputed by many employees. While over half of managers felt that staff, particularly older ones, lacked some basic online skills, over 95% of staff expressed confidence in their own digital abilities. More work is needed to unpack the reasons for these divided views, but the enthusiasm of staff to engage with digital systems seems inarguable; the majority of staff used digital devices such as smartphones and tablets more extensively in their personal lives than at the workplace, and managers and staff were united in wanting to see more widespread use of digital technologies.</p> <p>The effectiveness of the peer support approach for introducing more digital technologies into the workplace was also widely recognised. Every social care organisation has digital enthusiasts, including managers, staff, volunteers and other people using their services. Digital champion programmes, such as those in the housing sector, may offer a promising model from which social care can learn.</p> <p>Our research suggests that focus should be on supporting learning and development for staff in a range of ways, including peer support in the workplace via digital champions, and options for improving access to shared resources, knowledge and experience. Skills for Care is working with partners to develop ways to implement these recommendations, so that the care sector can continue to develop to the best of its potential. “The whole world is going digital,” says one care assistant, “and we need to do the same.”</p> <p>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/nmds-sc-intelligence-research-and-innovation/research/digital-capabilities-in-the-social-care-workforce.aspx\">Skills for Care website for more information</a>, or Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/skillsforcare\">@skillsforcare</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaraDunnAssoc\">@saradunnassoc</a>.</p> <p><em>The learning and development hub is funded by Skills for Care.

The procedure went wrong and her body was found in a pool of blood, with a shallow grave already dug nearby.</p><p>The guardians of the girl – Jackson Lesale Lanoi and his wife, Eunice Sintana Lesale – who nursed her four-month-old baby in the dock throughout the proceedings – pleaded not guilty to murder at the Machakos high court.</p><p>The couple, who have been remanded in custody since 15 April, were refused bail. The prosecutor opposed their release on the grounds that they come from the same area as the witnesses in the case and that they posed a flight risk. A bail hearing has been set for 26 June.</p><p>The couple also face charges in a lower court of aiding and abetting FGM. Another woman was charged alongside the couple in both cases, but the murder charge against her was recently dropped.</p><p>Dozens of friends and relatives of the couple gathered outside the one-room court, where proceedings where delayed while a Masai interpreter was found.</p><p>\"We have been practising female circumcision since time immemorial,\" a Masai man, who asked not to be named, said. \"This is just one of the rare cases where somebody has died from the rite, there is nothing criminal about it.\"</p><p>But Christine Nanjala, the head of a newly formed anti-FGM unit in Kenya's office of the director of public prosecutions, said: \"We hope these cases will act as a deterrent and will bring out that the law is being enforced.\"</p><p>A day earlier in Kajiado – the same part of rural Kenya where Ntagusa died – scores of Masai women marched in support of FGM, saying it was part of their culture and the government should allow the practice. The demonstration reportedly descended into violent scuffles in which three journalists and at least one local representative were injured. Accounts by the journalists involved suggest the protesters accused them and the officials of being part of the government's fight against FGM.</p><p>According to a 2009 public health  survey, 73% of women in Kenya's Masai ethnic community have been subjected to FGM. The same survey found 27% of women across the country have been cut, despite the practice being outlawed in 2001.</p><p>\"Communities feel that they are being victimised by the government, many resent the law,\" said Wanjala Wafula, founder of Coexist Initiative, which brings men and boys together in the fight against gender-based violence in Kenya. \"The whole epidemic has gone underground in Kenya. We are now seeing some communities circumcising girls a few hours after birth so that they can avoid detection later on.\"</p><p>Stiffer legislationagainst FGM was passed in 2011, making it illegal to promote or facilitate the practice, but awareness of the law remains low. Of the 71 FGM cases taken to court since 2011, police statistics suggest convictions have been secured in 16 cases; 33 are still pending before the court. Activists describe corruption as a barrier to gathering sufficient evidence to successfully prosecute perpetrators of FGM. Many witnesses are unwilling to testify.</p><p>Kenya's 20-strong anti-FGM prosecution unit, established in April, is deploying teams across the country in an attempt to prosecute more cases. \"We are explaining to community and religious leaders and other officials around the country that this is what the law provides,\" said Nanjala. \"This is a crime, these are the consequences. We are now prosecuting, this is not a negotiation.</p><p>\"The levels of secrecy are very high. If we can get the goodwill of the community leaders we could go a long way.\"</p><p>The anti-FGM prosecution unit has brought several cases to court, including the case being heard in Machakos and another case against a chief who sought to mutilate his own daughters.</p><p>\"We hope that this [Machakos case] will be a pacesetter for future prosecutions. The relationship between the director of public prosecutions and civil society is more collaborative now,\" said Wafula, whose organisation works with community whistleblowers to help identify girls at risk.</p><p>Kenya's first lady, Margaret Kenyatta, has added her voice to the call for the eradication of FGM in the country. At an alternative rites of passage event in Kajiado – in which more than 270 girls graduated to womanhood without being cut – she called on Kenya to \"achieve a zero FGM status\".</p><p>\"You are a testimony that culture is dynamic and that communities need to embrace and retain what is good while doing away with retrogressive parts,\" she said, addressing the girls participating in the ceremony. \"Let us all declare today that FGM is not necessary in the 21st century.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/04/kenya-couple-deny-murder-fgm-case","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2014/jun/04/kenya-couple-deny-murder-fgm-case","sectionName":"Society"},{"webTitle":"New Africa: the Kenyan internet nerd reshaping a nation","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-25T23:00:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2012/aug/26/new-africa-kenya-activist-internet","fields":{"body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/08/juliana-rotich-100-women\" title=\"\">Juliana Rotich</a> chuckles down the line from Nairobi at the suggestion that she is one of the people helping to shape a new image of Africa. \"Well, I'm a big nerd,\" she says. \"So if a nerd can be part of the future, let's do this.\"</p><p>In 2008, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/28/kenya.international\" title=\"\">political and ethnic violence broke out in Kenya after disputed elections</a>, Rotich was trapped at home in the western city of Eldoret, where <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/03/kenya.topstories3\" title=\"\">some of the worst fighting</a> was taking place.</p><p>A blackout on live news broadcasts had left Kenyans unable to get basic information about what was going on. So Rotich and a group of friends created a website, called <a href=\"http://ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi (\"testimony\" in Swahili)</a>, that used updates from ordinary people, via emails and text messages, and plotted these on an interactive map.</p><p>\"We did something which was pretty natural for us but it was very cathartic,\" Juliana explains. \"It was important to share what I knew.\"</p><p>Within days, Ushahidi was providing information about the spread of fighting to thousands of Kenyans across the country. And throughout the conflict and its aftermath, it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2011/apr/07/ushahidi-crowdmap-kenya-violence-hague\" title=\"\">helped to document the scale of the violence</a>, despite the attempts of politicians to play it down. Since then, the Ushahidi model has been adapted for humanitarian crises worldwide – it was credited  with locating survivors under the rubble<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jan/29/haiti-crowdsourcing\" title=\"\">following the Haiti earthquake</a> – and also found a variety of other, less dramatic uses – a recent application mapped small UK businesses keen to promote themselves during the Olympics.</p><p>The 35-year-old Rotich bubbles with excitement when talking about its global reach: \"The platform has been translated into 20 languages. Can you imagine?' But she's cautious of the kind of breathless post-Arab-spring rhetoric about the power of information-sharing technology to bring sweeping political change. For Rotich its primary role, at least in Africa, is a more prosaic one: helping people get better and cheaper access to basic goods and services rather than inspiring revolution. \"Democracy is an alluring idea,\" she says. \"And we do hope that our technology plays a role but I want to keep that in the context of some of the challenges that are on the ground and the opportunities for technology to help with some of the inefficiencies.\"</p><p>She's proud of the way Ushahidi gave a voice to ordinary Kenyans to explain what was happening in their own communities. \"Africans tell their story better and represent the reality that they live better. When you have a view on a situation from on the ground, it can complicate the narrative in an important way. It wasn't easy for the rest of the world just to say, oh that's another genocide happening'.\"</p><p>As a regular speaker at global technology events, she is all too conscious of how Africa is perceived by the outside world. \"I usually dive straight into the technology and people are shocked, because they are thinking, 'She's an African woman, I expected her to talk about how things are terrible or tell a sad story.'</p><p>\"But in my world, the reality is very exciting. I see young people here in Nairobi and they come up and they say this is my startup idea. People have the option of creating something, filling a need, scratching an itch.\"</p><p>So how would an Africa that has shaken off its negative image appear to the world?</p><p>\"When you see those online adverts, those ones that say, 'Volunteer in Africa – come and work in an orphanage or a game park', and there's usually a picture of a lion,\" she says. \"There might be a future where you'll see an advert that says, 'Come and work in the hi-tech sector'.\"</p><p></p><h2><strong>Innovators she admires</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Lukonga Lindunda</strong>, the founder of <a href=\"http://www.bongohive.com/\" title=\"\">BongoHive</a>, an incubator of startups in Lusaka, Zambia. \"The idea is to galvanise the tech community in Zambia to think about what problems they'd like to solve.

Previously confined to the more forward-thinking digital agencies, creative tech has crossed over into traditional and integrated agency structures. This transformation is reflected in award-winning work but also in the real world, where it enhances creative expression and provides smarter ways of applying data.</p> <p> While this innovation is arguably what defines the future of brand engagement, there remain several barriers to its progression, most notably in the areas of talent, operations and finance.</p> <p>Agencies and brands often lack the kind of talent capable of developing creative technology solutions – more specifically, people capable of building both code and electronics for prototypes. Agencies also need people who understand both digital strategy and creative idea generation. While this talent can be found in tech development or creative departments, it is often better to recruit from outside the industry and nurture good people.</p> <p> Operational issues also hinder the impact of creative technology. The linear <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">waterfall processes</a> led by planners and art director/copywriter teams are a particular barrier. To produce the best work, it’s preferable to develop concepts through an iterative process with a diverse team, recognising that the big idea can often come from a utility or technology opportunity.</p> <p> Finally, and most significantly, are the financial barriers. Agency output is usually financed through marketing campaign budgets and needs to pay back within a short timeframe. Agencies often heavily subsidise the work to persuade clients to back an idea. Instead, creative technology should be funded through capital expenditure with a robust business case, allowing for larger returns over a longer timeframe. The impact is increased even further if clients and agencies can use a model that consciously builds innovation into their ways of working.</p> <p> To unlock these issues, and to help agencies and brands create the future of brand engagement, the Marketing Agencies Association (MAA) is launching a new initiative around creative technology. This starts with our first event later in January.

In-house servers and off-site back-ups are also just options rather than essentials. Thanks to the cloud, startups are spoiled for choice when it comes to setting up their technology platforms. </p> <p>Software as a Service (SaaS), which sees software centrally held and licensed on a subscription basis and accessed via web browser; managed hosting; and cloud based solutions are fast gaining traction, bringing cost savings, flexibility and efficiency. A <a href=\"https://bdaily.co.uk/technology/27-08-2014/flexibility-tempts-half-of-british-smes-to-the-cloud-reveals-latest-vistage-membership-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent survey by Vistage</a> found that 49% of SMEs in Britain are making use of cloud-based services.</p> <p><strong>Starting up lean</strong></p> <p>When Nicky Rudd launched PR firm Padua Communications nearly five years ago she set out to do it differently to any business she had worked for before. “Everything we do is in the cloud now,” says Rudd. “From the start we planned to work with specialist freelancers, and doing everything online using cloud-based solutions means that any document that needs to be shared can be easily accessed by everybody regardless of location.” </p> <p>Padua Communications uses Google Drive as a central library for documents that need to be shared. Cloud-based software Quickbooks is used for accounting and presentation software Pressie is used in addition to PowerPoint.</p> <p>The company has embraced online software fully. The most recent addition is Dropbox. “We have used it for the last 18 months. We started using it because clients are using it so we were getting asked to share files, logos, videos and images,” explains Rudd. “Because I liked it we now use it as a back-up for our client system.”</p> <p>All employees and freelancers have a company-specific email address and this again is a lot easier than it would have been before. “When we work with someone, even if it is just for one project, we can set them up with a Padua Communications email and a login to the system – we’d be able to sort that out in 15 minutes and I could do it from my phone, it is so easy,” she explains.</p> <p><strong>Reach for the cloud</strong></p> <p>But it’s not just new startups that are making the most of online solutions. Many businesses that launched using traditional working practices find themselves switching to the cloud. One of them is financial advisor Russell Gibson Financial Management – they have started to migrate systems to the cloud by adopting Zoho CRM, and it’s only the beginning of a bigger project, according to operations director Alex Orban. “I’d love to move everything to the cloud, I would like to not have one server in the building – that is part of the project we have called declutter,” he explains. </p> <p>Previously client meetings were documented in written notes on Excel docs and scheduled via Outlook calendars. “There was a lot of paper flying about but that was combined using Microsoft Outlook. There were a lot of disconnects when it came to seeing an overall view of a client and what, if any, actions had been taken,” says Orban. It is early days and so far Russell Gibson is 20% cloud-based, but already it is making a big difference in working practices. </p> <p>“Because we are working with shared data the efficiency is improved. In the traditional linear set-up you’d say to someone, ‘I’d like you to take a look at something, I’ll get you the file tomorrow’. That way you have already lost a day,” explains Orban. Now I can send my colleague a link to a document and say, ‘Here’s the link, if you can take a look that would be great’.”</p> <p>Like Rudd, Will Pain set up his business to work specifically with a group of freelance suppliers, but when he launched he had a server in his home that everybody dialled into. He has since changed this using managed servers from cloud hosting provider Memset. “We used to have people dialling into the server in my home but it is not really set up for the job because the bandwidth isn’t great and it is not in a proper centre. If my Internet connection went down at home it was game over,” he says. “Centralising our system has resolved that because the data centre is very well equipped to deal with those situations and the Internet is very unlikely to be down at Memset.”</p> <p><strong>Savings and efficiency</strong></p> <p>So what are the benefits of ditching the traditional path in favour of the cloud? Well, for starters there are cost savings. Many cloud-based applications such as Dropbox and Gmail are usually paid for by subscription per user so you don’t need to spend a lot on software packages. Business applications such as Microsoft Office 365 from O2 are ideal for remote and mobile workers who need to access their firm’s cloud-based IT system.</p> <p>Servers and other hardware offer other potential cost savings. “Not having to get all of the hardware is a big deal. It is much more cost-effective than having the piece of hardware and ensuring it has all the software you need on it,” says Rudd, but adds that the benefits extend beyond cost savings. “I think more than that it is the speed you can be up and running so quickly and efficiently. The speed with which we get people sharing files and access documents is great.”</p> <p>Another huge benefit, according to Pain, is that using a cloud provider has removed the worry about unexpected costs from failing equipment. “It is hugely attractive to me that if anything goes wrong with the hardware it is totally Memset’s responsibility. They have the spare hardware and they will just replace it instantly if it goes wrong. If I have a server in my office and it breaks it is a big problem,” he explains. “I found that I went from worrying about hardware failures and not getting a back-up, and now our only concern is whether we have an Internet connection where we are and is it good enough for the cloud. And it doesn’t tend to be a big problem wherever you are.”</p> <p><em>Content on this page is paid for and produced to a brief agreed with <a href=\"http://servedby.o2.co.uk/click/6/34137;849191;50126;211;0/?ft_width=1&amp;ft_height=1&amp;url=5311631\" rel=\"nofollow\">O2 Business</a>, sponsor of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/supporting-business-growth\">supporting business growth hub. </a></em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network\"><em><br /></em></a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/o2-partner-zone/2014/oct/27/cloud-technology-helping-smes-drive-growth","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/small-business-network/o2-partner-zone/2014/oct/27/cloud-technology-helping-smes-drive-growth","sectionName":"Small Business Network - O2 partner zone"},{"webTitle":"Technology developments spark hardware revolution for young startups","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-11T12:05:15Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2015/jan/11/startups-hardware-new-technology-revolution","fields":{"body":"<p>When I ask Emily Brooke if she thinks we’re in the middle of a hardware revolution, she doesn’t hesitate. “Yes I do,” she says firmly. “It used to be the big tech companies that made hardware. Now people like me with a university project can prototype, manufacture and ship their product to consumers around the world within just a couple of years.”</p> <p>In 2011, towards the end of a product design course at the University of Brighton, Emily Brooke came up with an idea for a bike light. As well as providing conventional illumination, the Blaze Laserlight, as she called it, projects a green bike symbol onto the ground five metres ahead of the cyclist, alerting other road users to their presence. She created a prototype and in just five days raised £25,000 on Kickstarter, proving there was demand for her product. Thanks to a recent development in laser diode technology, she found that her idea was both achievable and affordable. At a factory in Shenzhen it became tangible, too, and the 29-year-old shipped her first product last February. Now the light is being sold in 47 countries.</p> <p>Brooke is one of a growing number of tech entrepreneurs who are discovering that hardware is no longer off limits to cash-strapped startups. Recent technological developments such as 3D printing have made the prototyping process easier and more affordable. No longer do you have to fulfil a minimum order requirement at an injection moulding factory in China, shelling out thousands, to find out whether an early iteration of your product works. A working prototype can be built using accessible technology over the course of a weekend.</p> <p>The internet has helped smooth the process too. Before the product even exists, a startup can form relationships with future customers through social media and use crowdfunding platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/\">Kickstarter</a> to raise money. Often this is just enough to get the enterprise off the ground, but it can help persuade manufacturers and venture capitalists that there’s enough interest in the product to make it worth investing in.</p> <p>Another factor that made Brooke’s journey a little easier was the intervention of a company called PCH International. A middleman connecting large western brands such as Beats and Apple with factories in China, PCH recently turned its attention to hardware startups. It now runs two incubators in San Francisco: Highway1, a four-month mentorship programme for early-stage startups; and Access, which helps more established companies achieve scale. Brooke, a graduate of the latter, describes their work as “inspirational”.</p> <p>Repaying the compliment, PCH’s founder and CEO Liam Casey tells me that startups such as <a href=\"https://www.blaze.cc/\">Blaze</a> are shaking up the hardware industry. “Big companies are usually constrained by technology and product roadmaps which slow down innovation,” he says. “When you work with startups, they’re far more disruptive in their thinking and their inexperience is a phenomenal innovator. We call them ‘Generation Y Not?’ They may not always be right but they speak with such clarity and passion, they’re worth listening to.”</p> <p>Casey, who previously worked in the garment industry, agrees that it’s a “phenomenal time to be involved in hardware”, but he stresses that the revolution is happening in prototyping, not manufacturing, which still remains an expensive task for companies large and small. “The fabrics of innovation are much more available,” he says. “Since the downturn in 2008, people have started to hack with hardware. Now you have Raspberry Pi and Intel Edison and 3D printers. These things are fuelling the imagination and convincing the entrepreneurs to take a chance.”</p> <p>The profile of the typical hardware entrepreneur is changing, he says. “Some of the best people we’re seeing now would have been completely focused on software in the past. We’re seeing a lot of designers with much bigger ambitions.” Casey welcomes this development but warns that the pitfalls have not disappeared. “The basic obstacles are always going to be there. You can have a great idea for a company – hardware, software or whatever – but that’s only the first step. The fundamentals of growing a company are still a huge challenge.”</p> <p>Brooke echoes this. “There’s a slight risk of glamorisation in hardware. People are attracted by the easy part, which is getting yourself a prototype so you can crowdfund all that money. The really hard part is making it scalable. There are lots more hardware startups around me in London now but the number actually shipping product is still incredibly low. We’re doing it, but we still have all the problems of a tech startup. Hardware is hard!”</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/11/startups-hardware-new-technology-revolution","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2015/jan/11/startups-hardware-new-technology-revolution","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Can financial technology be used for social good? - live chat","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-14T11:22:44Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/2015/jan/14/can-financial-technology-be-used-for-social-good-live-chat","fields":{"body":"<p>From telecoms to the media, the past few decades have seen industries transformed by disruptive technology.

How can developing economies provide skilled labour, enable business development and meet the demands of international business? These were some of the many questions explored at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bioinnovate-africa.org/component/eventlist/details/52-partnership-forum-on-sustainable-development-meeting\" title=\"\">Partnership Forum on Sustainable Development</a>, which was held in Nairobi on June 3rd to reaffirm the goals of the Swedish Leadership for Sustainable Development initiative. The interest among Swedish institutional and private investors in Kenya and East Africa appears to be growing steadily as the Kenyan economy continues to develop.</p><p>The Governments of Sweden and Kenya have a long-standing history comprising more than 50 years of cooperation, which dates back to Kenya's independence in 1963. Today, many Swedish companies are represented in Kenya, including ABB, Alfa Laval, Atlas Copco, Bahco, Ericsson, Saab, Sandvik, Scania, SKF, Tetra Pak Eastern Africa and Volvo; several of these companies serve the entire African continent from Nairobi.</p><p>The Partnership Forum on Sustainable Development (hosted by the Swedish Embassy) was held in cooperation with the Kenyan Ministry of Industrialization and Enterprise Development, Business Sweden, the East Africa Business Council and the Kenya Private Sector Alliance to facilitate new collaboration and harness ideas for future sustainable development initiatives.</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.afdb.org/en/countries/east-africa/kenya/kenya-economic-outlook/\" title=\"\">According to the African Development Bank, economic growth in Kenya was estimated at 4.9% in 2013 and is projected to reach 5.7% in 2014</a>. The positive outlook for growth also suggests an opportune time for refining policies that focus on good governance, inclusiveness and job creation. The 'missing middle' of pro-poor small and medium enterprises is increasingly supported by the Swedish government. Focusing support on inclusive businesses, with an emphasis on gender empowerment and job creation, can also address income inequalities that coexist with economic growth.</p><p>Since the majority of Kenya's 40 million inhabitants live in rural areas and work in agriculture, the country's most vital sector cannot be underestimated. With this in mind, the forum linked sustainable growth to three pervasive themes: (i)&nbsp;business opportunities and women's entrepreneurship; (ii)&nbsp;innovations for sustainable development; and (iii)&nbsp;creating decent jobs. One of the many lessons learned was that it is critical for East Africa to look at other examples of regional integration – and to continue building an enabling environment for both established businesses and entrepreneurs. This will require frameworks for education, training and capacity building. Related questions included: how can companies be encouraged to think more broadly about the products they design, such as cookstoves? Conversely, how can government policies be more receptive to innovative models that companies bring to the table?</p><p>The excellent collaboration among the Swedish government and its development agencies, the Kenyan government and Kenyan business stakeholders showcases a promising partnership. Through this, development institutions, businesses and governments can successfully collaborate to address critical issues facing low-income communities. We look forward to the future achievements of this partnership.</p><p>For more information regarding the Partnership Forum on Sustainable Development and the Swedish Embassy's work on private-sector collaboration in Kenya, Somalia and within sub-Saharan Africa, contact Josephine Gustafsson at josephine.gustafsson@gov.se.</p><p><em>Karen Newman is senior communications consultant for </em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/business-call-to-action-partner-zone\" title=\"\"><em>Business Call to Action.</em></a></p><p><em>Launched at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.un.org/\">United Nations</a>, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.businesscalltoaction.org/\">Business Call to Action</a> (BCtA) is a global alliance hosted by the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.undp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Nations Development Programme</a> Headquarters in New York.

The app has been designed as a series of games and interactive tutorials teaching basic road safety as well as safer driving tips and first aid skills.</p><p></p><p>The app is part of a wider project – financed with $99,000 (£63,000) of seed funding from the Canadian government – which is attempting to tackle the spiralling death toll from motorbike accidents in Kenya.</p><p></p><p>The country already has one of the highest rates of road deaths, and traffic accidents are the <a href=\"http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/1370/wp545-281698.pdf\" title=\"\">third leading cause of premature death globally</a> (pdf), after malaria and HIV-Aids.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, motorcycle use in Kenya has grown exponentially since the government abolished import tax on  motorbikes.

If they know how to respond when they witness or hear about an accident, the life-saving potential is huge.\"</p><p></p><p>The idea is that those trained will then teach emergency skills to other drivers. The project will also offer training manuals, generate data on traffic patterns and accidents, and hopes to launch the first aid programme and mobile phone app in driving schools across the country.</p><p></p><p>The project will be launched this month in two cities in the Rift valley, working with 500 motorbike taxi drivers in each city.

His eyes had been gouged out, his genitals chopped off, his tongue cut out and he had been shot in the head.</p> <p>Ken Wafula, a human rights activist who has been campaigning for justice for the victims of the killings, rapes and displacement that gripped Kenya following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/23/court-kenyans-trial-election-violence\" title=\"\">disputed 2007 presidential election</a>, accused the government of targeting witnesses.</p> <p>“All the witnesses are at risk,” he said. “Those who testified in The Hague and those who chose to recant their statements; they are all being hunted down.”</p> <p>Family members say Yebei, 34, had been scheduled to testify against the deputy president, William Ruto, who is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/29/kenya-deputy-pm-denies-ethnic-attacks\" title=\"\">accused by the ICC of crimes against humanity</a> in connection with post-election violence in which at least 1,100 people died and 650,000 were forced from their homes.</p> <p>Yebei disappeared on 28 December from the town of Turbo in the Rift Valley province where he had taken a child for treatment.</p> <p>His brother, Nixon Yebei, said the police had been reluctant to act after they were informed of Yebei’s abduction. “Since we found the body in the mortuary, we are yet to receive any feedback from the police,” he told <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Family-wants-answers/-/1056/2579626/-/o80ywc/-/index.html\" title=\"\">the Daily Nation newspaper</a>.</p> <p>The director of public prosecutions, Keriako Tobiko, released a letter on Tuesday urging the police to carry out “a speedy and thorough investigation”.</p> <p>But Ruto’s lawyer, Karim Khan, insisted that Yebei was in fact a critical witness for the defence, not the prosecution, and demanded that the police come up with answers. “News of his apparent abduction and murder is both shocking to us and a matter of grave concern,” he added.</p> <p>The mysterious killing of Yebei has refocused attention on the question of the Kenyan government’s commitment to finding justice for victims of the wave of violence that gripped the east African country in early 2008.</p> <p>Ruto and a radio journalist, Joshua arap Sang, are accused of inciting members of their Kalenjin community to kill dozens of members of the Kikuyu community who share an ethnicity with president Mwai Kibaki, who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/05/kenya.international\" title=\"\">controversially declared the winner of the 2007 election</a>.</p> <p>At the time, most members of the Kalenjin community supported Kibaki’s rival, Raila Odinga, who is now the opposition leader. They immediately rounded on members of the Kikuyu community, killing hundreds. Members of a Kikuyu gang, the Mungiki, a feared extortion cartel dreaded for its reputation of ritual beheadings, orchestrated revenge killings against perceived opposition supporters.</p> <p>Prosecutors in The Hague contend that the killings were financed and incited by political elites. The defence teams, however, say the violence was spontaneous and driven by ethnic-based communal grievances.</p> <p>The current president, Uhuru Kenyatta, was also charged with financing mobs to kill opposition supporters during that election. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/05/crimes-humanity-charges-kenya-president-dropped-uhuru-kenyatta\" title=\"\">His case in The Hague collapsed last month</a> after prosecutors complained that the Kenyan government had refused to cooperate with the prosecution and engaged in a campaign of witness bribery and intimidation, including exposing witnesses’ identities on social media.</p> <p>Fatou Bensouda, the ICC’s chief prosecutor, told the Guardian: “We have seen constant challenges. Not only the lack of adequate and timely cooperation that we requested, but we had the issue of the interference with witnesses, even interference with potential witnesses, and those who were simply too terrified to come to the court to testify. We have those who have already given us their evidence but then decided to either withdraw it or to change their accounts.”</p> <p>She denied that the dropping of the charges had damaged the credibility of the ICC. “All of this has hurt the case. This is what has happened and with that evidence as it is, knowing it would have to be sustained at conviction or trial, I did what I had to do. I was not in a position to proceed and I have withdrawn. I think this shows responsibility. It shows that the court will not just frivolously continue with a case that has been hurt. We will do the right thing and I believe that this should add to the credibility of the court and not the other way around.”</p> <p>Human Rights Watch also criticised the government’s handling of the matter. Elizabeth Evenson, the organisation’s senior international justice counsel, said: “It’s clear that Kenya’s long tradition of impunity and pressure on witnesses have been serious obstacles to a fair process before the ICC. But these roadblocks make it all the more important for the ICC to assess how it can move ahead with high-profile cases against powerful people accused of serious crimes.”</p> <p>The collapse of the case against Kenyatta, a Kikuyu, has added an extra layer of political intrigue in Kenya because it means only members of the Kalenjin community remain in the dock. The outcome of the case is expected to test the alliance forged by Kenyatta and Ruto to win the last election and could also strain ties between communities in the volatile mixed settlements of the Rift Valley.</p> <p>The ICC said on Tuesday that Yebei had been offered protection but was not on the prosecution witness list at the time of his death.</p> <p>Herman von Hebel, ICC registrar, said: “While local authorities are conducting further examination, the family of Mr Yebei has confirmed the identity of his body. We express our profound condolences to the family.</p> <p>“The court is profoundly concerned by this grave reported incident. It stands ready to provide the local authorities with any assistance, if required, in their investigations. Ensuring the safety and security of witnesses is a cornerstone of fair trials.”</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/06/witness-mutilated-body-kenya-government-killing-meshack-yebei-william-ruto","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jan/06/witness-mutilated-body-kenya-government-killing-meshack-yebei-william-ruto","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"World Bank accuses itself of failing to protect Kenya forest dwellers","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-29T13:36:46Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2014/sep/29/world-bank-kenya-forest-dwellers","fields":{"body":"<p>A leaked copy of a World Bank investigation seen by the Guardian has accused the bank of failing to protect the rights of one of Kenya’s last groups of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jan/07/kenya-embobut-forest-forced-evictions-police\" title=\"\">forest people, who are being evicted</a> from their ancestral lands in the name of climate change and conservation.</p> <p>Thousands of homes belonging to hunter-gatherer Sengwer people living in the Embobut forest in the Cherangani hills were burned down earlier this year by Kenya forest service guards who had been ordered to clear the forest as part of a carbon offset project that aimed to reduce emissions from deforestation.</p> <p>The result has been that more than 1,000 people living near the town of Eldoret have been classed as squatters and forced to flee what they say has been government harassment, intimidation and arrest.</p> <p>The evictions were condemned in February by the UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination, and drew in the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, who expressed alarm at what was described by 360 national and international civil society organisations and individuals as “cultural genocide”.

If the board decides to endorse the action plan, the evictions are certain to be completed. More than half the people evicted are thought to have returned to their lands.</p> <p>“The eviction of such ancestral communities leaves the indigenous forests open to exploitation and destruction; whereas securing such communities rights to their lands and responsibility to continue traditional conservation practices, protects their forests,” said the Forest Peoples Programme.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/29/world-bank-kenya-forest-dwellers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2014/sep/29/world-bank-kenya-forest-dwellers","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Rhino microchipping in Kenya - video","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-10T06:00:00Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/video/2014/feb/10/rhino-microchipping-in-kenya","fields":{"body":"<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-429169097\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/2/7/1391779393739/Silhouettes-Of-Africa-008.jpg\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/07/140207Rhino-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/07/140207Rhino/140207Rhino.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/07/140207Rhino_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/07//140207Rhino.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/07/140207Rhino_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2014/feb/10/rhino-microchipping-in-kenya","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/video/2014/feb/10/rhino-microchipping-in-kenya","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Which technology do you avoid using? | Open thread","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-13T13:38:38Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2014/oct/13/technology-christopher-nolan-interstellar-celluloid-cinemas","fields":{"body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/christopher-nolan\" title=\"\">Christopher Nolan</a>, the film director, has said that <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/Americas/article1470078.ece\" title=\"\">he is not interested in new technology</a> and has “rewarded” cinemas that still use celluloid by allowing them advanced access to his new film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/interstellar\" title=\"\">Interstellar</a>.

So <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/speakers/richard_turere.html\" title=\"\">Richard Turere</a>, a 13-year-old Maasai cattle herder, combined rudimentary technology with teenage ingenuity to find another way.</p><p>Turere is the inventor of \"lion lights\", a fence made of a car battery, solar panel and torch bulbs that ensures lions no longer dare touch his father's livestock. The young Kenyan has been lauded as an inspiration after giving a recent <a href=\"http://on.ted.com/Turere\" title=\"\">TED talk</a> about his invention.</p><p>Turere lives in Kitengela on the edge of Nairobi national park. He told how wild animals that migrate from the park are pursued and killed by lions.</p><p>\"My community, the Maasai, we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them, and that's why we value them so much,\" says Turere, who started herding his family's cattle when he was nine. \"So I grew up hating lions so much. The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock, and they're also upset about this problem. So they <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/six-lions-speared-death-nairobi-livestock\" title=\"\">kill the lions</a> … And I think this is why the Nairobi national park lions are few.\"</p><p>Turere said he tried various ideas for a more peaceful solution, such as a kerosene lamp and a scarecrow. \"But lions are very clever. They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back, but the second day, they'll come and they say, this thing is not moving here, it's always here. So he jumps in and kills the animals.\"</p><p>But, one night, Turere went to the cowshed with a torch and found that the lions stayed away. \"I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.\"</p><p>The teenager – who has a knack for making things from scrapyard parts – bought a car battery, motorcycle indicator box, switches, torch bulbs and solar panel, and hooked them together. It worked, and now dozens of lion lights <a href=\"http://lionlights.wildlifedirect.org/2013/03/13/lights\" title=\"\">have been rigged up around Kenya</a>.</p><p>As a consequence, Turere gained a scholarship to one of the country's top schools, delivered a TED talk in Longbeach, California, last month, and has ambitions to be an aircraft engineer and pilot when he grows up.</p><p>\"I used to hate lions,\" he adds, \"but now, because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions, we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/08/kenya-maasai-lions-solar-power","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/apr/08/kenya-maasai-lions-solar-power","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Local people 'need access to technology to survive disasters'","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-17T08:49:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2013/oct/17/local-people-access-technology-survive-disasters","fields":{"body":"<p>Lack of access to information and technology has a major bearing on people's ability to prepare for, survive and recover from disasters, according to the <a href=\"http://worlddisastersreport.org/en/\" title=\"\">2013 world disasters report</a>.</p><p></p><p>While new technologies greatly enhance the ability of disaster-affected communities to help themselves, the report, published by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Geneva on Thursday, says access to technology is deeply unequal. This digital divide is prominent in the most disaster-prone countries around the world.</p><p></p><p>The report emphasises that during the first critical hours after an emergency, most lives saved are actually by local people. Yet many of these first responders do not have access to basic life-saving information and tools, such as early warning systems and basic connectivity and network infrastructure.</p><p></p><p>The report also warns that as humanitarian agencies increasingly turn to new technologies as a source of information about disaster-affected communities' needs, they run the risk of only listening to those who are connected, and excluding those who are not. The report urges the private sector, humanitarian organisations, governments and local communities to work together to ensure access to technology for these poorest communities.</p><p></p><p>\"There are great examples of what can happen when technology experts and humanitarians put their heads together,\" said Ed Happ, the IFRC's global chief information officer. \"The IFRC and the telecommunications company Trilogy developed the Tera SMS system, which has allowed 3 million people in Haiti to receive hurricane warnings and disease prevention advice. We recently set it up in Sierra Leone, and our ambition is to launch Tera in 40 countries. But we can't do it alone, we need the private and public sectors to work with us.\"</p><p></p><p>This year's report focuses on the role of technology – its potential and its limitations. The widespread use of technology, particularly mobile phone texting, played a huge role in preventing a large loss of life when cyclone Phailin hit the state of Odisha in India last week. The 1999 cyclone in this region killed 10,000 people. This time, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-24546015\" title=\"\">27 people have died</a> so far.</p><p></p><p>\"Technology played a key role in keeping people informed before and during the cyclone,\" said Simon Eccleshall, IFRC head of disaster and crisis management. \"People were prepared. Technology made things quicker this time. Before, people were informed by loudhailer house to house. Now it's text message – people sharing information.\"</p><p></p><p>In another example of how organisations are using technology, the American Red Cross has set up a digital operations centre (DigiDoc), which allows social media posts from the disaster affected area to be tracked and integrated into response decision-making.</p><p></p><p>\"This gives the American Red Cross the ability to monitor positive or negative sentiment, displayed in real time,\" said Eccleshall. \"It shows where there is a problem, and allows headquarters to call a branch and ask what is going on to create a blip.\"</p><p></p><p>Last year saw the lowest number of deaths and people affected by disasters in the last 10 years, but in terms of costs 2012 was still the fifth most expensive year of the last decade. According to the IFRC, deaths from disasters in 2012 were 90% below the average for the decade. The number of disaster events is also among the decade's lowest.</p><p></p><p>In all, there were 552 disasters costing just under $158bn last year. The most expensive event was hurricane Sandy in the US, which cost $50bn; the deadliest was typhoon Bopha in the Philippines, which killed 1,901 people. Floods accounted for 53% of the 139 million affected by disasters in 2012, with the most severe taking place in China in April and June.</p><p></p><p>\"We got lucky last year, but we are by no means complacent,\" said Eccleshall. \"It's simply a matter of time before a large-scale disaster will impact a large number of people. The interesting trend is that big disasters have tended to be in high-income countries, whereas donors have looked at responding in low-income countries.\"</p><p></p><p>In a separate <a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7491-geography-poverty-disasters-climate-change-2030\" title=\"\">report published on Wednesday, the Overseas Development Institute </a> (ODI) said governments should forget plans to end extreme poverty if they fail to come to terms with the increased risk of natural disasters in some of the poorest parts of the world.</p><p></p><p>The ODI estimated that around a third of a billion extremely poor people will be living in countries highly exposed to natural hazards by 2030 – more than the current population of the US. In sub-Saharan Africa, 118 million extremely poor people will face extreme weather hazards – with more than 20 million people at risk in countries such as Nigeria and Ethiopia.</p><p></p><p>Without addressing the current paltry levels of funding available for efforts to reduce the risk posed by natural disasters – just $0.40 in every $100 of aid – recent progress made in reducing global poverty efforts could be set back by \"a lifetime overnight\" in countries where drought, hurricanes and flash floods are a threat, warned the ODI.</p><p></p><p>According to the report, the 11 countries most at risk of disaster-induced poverty are Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda.</p><p></p><p>\"We know that disasters entrench poverty – they don't just end lives, they destroy shops, roads, crops, houses and hospitals in places where there are no safety nets such as insurance or social security,\" said Tom Mitchell, the ODI's head of climate change and one of the report's authors. \"Without meaningful change, talk of the end of extreme poverty is pie in the sky.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/oct/17/local-people-access-technology-survive-disasters","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/oct/17/local-people-access-technology-survive-disasters","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Kenya passes law to step up fight against human trafficking","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-29T11:46:35Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2014/aug/29/kenya-law-human-trafficking","fields":{"body":"<p>Kenya has passed a law that will make it easier to secure convictions for human trafficking by providing greater support to victims, encouraging them to give evidence, campaigners said.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cickenya.org/index.php/legislation/item/337-the-victim-protection-bill-2013#.VABGRRZTrOF\" title=\"\">victim protection bill</a> approved by the country’s parliament on Wednesday aims to improve support to victims of crime, including provision of a place of safety, food, medical treatment, psychosocial care and police protection. It also establishes a fund to assist victims.</p> <p>“The most successful way of countering trafficking in persons, especially for children, is through securing conviction against the traffickers,” said Prudence Mutiso, a lawyer with the child rights charity The Cradle, which provides legal aid to children in Kenyan courts. “With the victim protection act, we will be able to have a stronger prosecution case.”</p> <p>Kenya has been on the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2014/\" title=\"\">US department of state’s Tier 2 watchlist</a> for <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/spotlight/Trafficking-and-modern-day-slavery\" title=\"\">trafficking</a> for the past three years for failing to make serious efforts to tackle the problem. It is a source, transit and destination country for men, women and children subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking.</p> <p>Although Kenya’s Counter Trafficking in Persons Act became law in 2012, there have been very few successful prosecutions because of the high threshold of evidence required to obtain a conviction.</p> <p>Children in Kenya are trafficked to work as domestic labourers and in farming, fisheries and begging. They are also trafficked for sex work, particularly for tourists on the coast.</p> <p>Many trafficking victims are so traumatised that they are unwilling to give evidence, Mutiso said. “The process of interviewing the victim, collecting and corroborating evidence and investigating perpetrators is more effective when the victim is accessing care and protection from a service provider as early in the process as possible,” she said.</p> <p>“If the victim is traumatised and they undergo counselling with help from the funds that the government has set aside, they will be in a position to address the court more confidently.”</p> <p>Of more than 200 child trafficking cases brought to The Cradle since 2009, only 43 have gone to court, and there have been few convictions.</p> <p>“I think it’s really going to help secure some convictions. It definitely will,” said Ruth Juliet Gachanja, another lawyer with The Cradle.</p> <p>Campaigners believe the fact that the new law gives victims’ lawyers the right to address the court will also strengthen the prosecution’s case.</p> <p>“When you are a victim of crime, you can now have your lawyer and your lawyer can cross-examine the other party [the accused],” said Millie Mabona, a lawyer and a member of parliament who sponsored the bill.</p> <p>“Your lawyer can also introduce new evidence if the prosecutor does not. This is very significant, especially for cases of trafficking, cases of sexual offences, cases of domestic violence.”</p> <p>Until now, lawyers representing victims had only a watching brief, which meant they sat in court as silent observers. Prosecutions were led by police officers, often with less legal expertise than the victims’ lawyers.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/29/kenya-law-human-trafficking","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2014/aug/29/kenya-law-human-trafficking","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"The smartest cities rely on citizen cunning and unglamorous technology","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-22T11:15:59Z","sectionId":"cities","id":"cities/2014/dec/22/the-smartest-cities-rely-on-citizen-cunning-and-unglamorous-technology","fields":{"body":"<p>We are lucky enough to live at a time in which a furious wave of innovation is breaking across the cities of the global south, spurred on both by the blistering pace of urbanisation, and by the rising popular demand for access to high-quality infrastructure that follows in its wake. <br /></p> <p>From <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/participatory-democracy-in-porto-alegre\">Porto Alegre’s participatory budgeting</a> and the literally destratifying <a href=\"http://www.u-tt.com/projects_Metrocable.html\">cable cars of Caracas</a>, to Nairobi’s “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/feb/19/cities-motion-how-we-mapped-matatus-nairobi\">digital matatus</a>” and the repurposed <a href=\"http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/with-buses-bolted-to-tugboats-manila-proves-any-city-can-have-a-ferry-syste\">bus-ferries of Manila</a>, the communities of the south are responsible for an ever-lengthening parade of social and technical innovations that rival anything the developed world has to offer for ingenuity and practical utility.<br /></p> <p>Nor is India an exception to this tendency. <a href=\"http://www.transparentchennai.com/participatory-mapping-as-a-tool/\">Transparent Chennai’s participatory maps</a> and the work of the Mumbai-based practices <a href=\"http://crit.in/\">CRIT</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/28/slum-loaded-term-homegrown-neighbourhoods-mumbai-dharavi\">URBZ</a> are better-known globally, but it is the tactics of daily survival devised by the unheralded multitude that really inspire urbanists. These techniques maximise the transactive capacity of the urban fabric, wrest the very last increment of value from the energy invested in the production of manufactured goods, and allow millions to eke a living, however precarious, from the most unpromising of circumstances. At a time of vertiginously spiralling economic and environmental stress globally, these are insights many of us in the developed north would be well advised to attend to – and by no means merely the poorest among us.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a83cd2dc558848c306ab396e97261b976bbfff7b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/19/1418987622944/855acd71-c338-4b94-af9f-03bce6e0e8ec-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cable cars in the San Agustin neighbourhood of Caracas.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cable cars in the San Agustin neighbourhood of Caracas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Gutierrez/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, for whatever reason, this is not the face of urban innovation official India wants to share with the world – perhaps small-scale projects or the tactics of the poor simply aren’t dramatic enough to convey the magnitude and force of national ambition. We hear, instead, of schemes like <a href=\"http://www.palava.in/\">Palava City</a>, a nominally futuristic vision of digital technology minutely interwoven into the texture of everday urban life. Headlines were made around the planet this year when Narendra Modi’s government announced it had committed to building no fewer than <a href=\"http://news.scroll.in/article/670881/The-long-and-short-of-what-we-know-about-Modi%27s-100-smart-cities/\">100 similarly “smart” cities</a>.</p> <p>Because definitions of the smart city remain so vague, I think it’s worth thinking carefully about what this might mean – beyond, that is, the 7,000 billion rupees (£70bn) in financing that India’s high powered expert committee on urban infrastructure believes the scheme will require over the next 20 years. It is one thing, after all, to reinforce the basic infrastructures that undergird the quality of urban life everywhere; quite another to propose saddling India’s cities with expensive, untested technology at a time when reliable access to electricity, clean drinking water or safe sanitary facilities remain beyond reach for too many.<br /></p> <p>We can take it as read that our networked technologies will continue to play some fairly considerable role in shaping the circumstances and possibilities experienced by billions of city-dwellers worldwide. So it’s only appropriate to consider the ways in which these technologies might inform decisions about urban land use, mobility and governance. <br /></p> <p>However, especially at a time of such enthusiasm for the notion in India, I think it’s vital to point out that “the smart city” is not the only way of bringing advanced information technology to bear on these questions of urban life. It’s but one selection from a sheaf of available possibilities, and not anywhere near the most responsive, equitable or fructifying among them.<br /></p> <p>We can see this most easily by considering just who it is the smart city is intended for – by seeking to discover what model of urban subjectivity is inscribed in the scenarios offered by the multinational IT vendors that developed the smart city concept in the first place, and who are heavily involved in sites like Palava. When you examine their internal documentation, marketing materials and extant interventions, it becomes evident there is a pronounced way of thinking about the civic that is bound up in all of them, with rather grim implications for the politics of participation. <br /></p> <p>A close reading leaves little room for doubt that vendors like Microsoft, IBM, Siemens, Cisco and Hitachi construct the resident of the smart city as someone without agency; merely a passive consumer of municipal services – at best, perhaps, a generator of data that can later be aggregated, mined for relevant inference, and acted upon. Should he or she attempt to practise democracy in any form that spills on to the public way, the smart city has no way of accounting for this activity other than interpreting it as an untoward disruption to the orderly flow of circulation. (This is explicit in Palava’s marketing materials, as well.) All in all, it’s a brutally reductive conception of civic life, and one with little to offer those of us whose notions of citizenhood are more robust.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6dd0ca594df6ff3bdc5d5be77e682a57d6f8be2e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/19/1418987404777/f8aba7d4-3aaf-4062-8c3c-cb300cf74985-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An Occupy Sandy outreach centre in the Rockaway Park neighbourhood of New York.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Organised by veterans of Occupy Wall Street, Occupy Sandy emerged in response to the unprecedented damage done to New York by Superstorm Sandy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Ruttle/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given how impoverished this vision is, a casual onlooker could hardly be faulted for concluding that networked information technology is something that will never furnish contemporary city-dwellers with the architecture of participation they deserve. But while this is certainly a more defensible position than breathless technophilia, or the blithe stories of triumphally self-regulating urban ecosystems the vendors themselves peddle, I happen to believe this is not the case. I remain convinced that ordinary city-dwellers can use networked informatics beneficially, to support them in their aims of group coordination, collective decision-making and deliberative self-determination. The following two case studies might help put some flesh on the bones of this assertion.</p> <p>Organised by veterans of Occupy Wall Street, the citizen relief group known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/10/occupy-police-enemies-sandy\">Occupy Sandy</a> emerged in response to the unprecedented damage done to New York City by Superstorm Sandy in October 2012. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given its lineage, OS was organised along strong principles of leaderlessness, horizontality and consensus. What may be more surprising is that this group of amateurs – unequipped with budgetary resources or any significant prior experience of logistics management, and assembled at a few hours’ notice – is universally acknowledged as having outstripped traditional, hierarchical and abundantly resourced groups like the US Federal Emergency Management Agency and the American Red Cross in delivering relief to the hardest-hit communities.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1e94be2ab08f807634e11b838d3f6f323ed45543\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/19/1418987877982/76431756-d231-4221-983f-e59daf2143a1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A volunteer relief centre set up by Occupy Sandy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A volunteer relief centre set up by Occupy Sandy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Occupy Sandy’s volunteers were unquestionably able to do this because they used networked technology to coordinate and maintain real-time situational awareness over their activities. Crucially, though, the systems they used were neither particularly elaborate, nor the ones many theorists of networked urbanism might have envisioned. They certainly didn’t have anything to do with the high-spec, high-margin instrumentation that IT multinationals would have municipal governments invest in.</p> <p>In a stroke of inspired creativity, Occupy activists repurposed Amazon’s existing e-commerce and fulfillment infrastructure, in the form of a wedding registry, to funnel donated goods to the distribution centre they had set up in a Brooklyn church. If this audacious act of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2014/03/23/jugaad-the-art-of-converting-adversity-into-opportunity/\"><em>jugaad</em></a> underwrote the entire recovery effort, its day-to-day operations relied upon another, as the movements of hundreds of volunteers and thousands of donations, hot meals and pieces of construction material were tracked in a single, gigantic Google Docs spreadsheet never intended for any such purpose. Asynchronous, robust, distributed technologies like mailing lists and text messaging completed the picture, allowing coordinators to maintain links between this nexus of activity and the growing community of donors, potential volunteers and activists that sprawled across the entire north-east region.<br /></p> <p>If supple, network-mediated coordination of this type could help people manage the highly dynamic circumstances that followed Sandy’s landfall, might it perhaps also prove useful under less volatile conditions? After all, the greatest disasters that ever befall most urban communities move more slowly than a hurricane. They are the ones that are economic in nature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59764ed3bfac90091aaa186ad069001ae747e58a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/19/1418986807803/a36f002f-2221-4a5c-b88c-526af795f527-460x310.jpeg\" alt=\"Design for the reinvigorated El Campo de Cebada.\" width=\"460\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Design for the reinvigorated El Campo de Cebada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Zuloark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The La Latina neighbourhood of Madrid was once home to a thriving market hall, and later a well-used community sporting facility, demolished in August 2009 to make way for planned improvements. But with Spain in the grips of the 2008 economic downturn, the money earmarked for the improvements failed to materialise, and the site remained vacant, cordoned off from the rest of the city by a chainlink fence. As such sacrifice zones will tend to, this site, <a href=\"http://www.publicspace.org/en/works/g362-el-campo-de-cebada\">el Campo de Cebada</a>, increasingly began to attract graffiti, illegal dumping and still-less salutary behavior. Alerted to the deteriorating situation by neighbours, city authorities claimed they were powerless to intervene, apparently in the belief that they had no right to intercede on land belonging to private developers.<br /></p> <p>Exasperated with this state of affairs, a group of community activists, including architects of the <a href=\"http://www.zuloark.com\">Zuloark collective</a>, cut through the fence and immediately began recuperating the site for citizen use. Following a cleanup, the activists used salvaged material to build benches, mobile sunshades and other elements of an ingenious, rapidly reconfigurable parliament – and the first question they put before this parliament was how to manage the site itself.<br /></p> <p>This self-stewardship was successful enough for long enough for the collective to eventually obtain quasi-official sanction from the municipal administration. Some three years on, in its various roles as recreation ground, youth centre and assembly hall, el Campo has become a vital community resource. If it has problems now, they are of the sort that attend unanticipated success: on holiday weekends especially, the site attracts overflow crowds.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c6fb9d282b25c637c5afafc3a7769be85aac7b31\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/19/1418986984671/ed6a1f18-cd2e-434b-bdb2-c149aca151dd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mobile grandstands created by the architecture collectives of El Campo de Cebada.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mobile grandstands created by the architecture collectives of El Campo de Cebada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C de Carmona/Zuloark</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where’s the technology in all of this? Beyond canny use of Twitter and Facebook, and an online calendar of activities, there isn’t much. That’s the point. The benches and platforms of el Campo aren’t festooned with sensors, don’t have IPv6 addresses, don’t comply with some ISO wireless-networking standard. The art walls aren’t high- resolution interactive touch surfaces, and the young people painting on them certainly haven’t been issued with Palava-style, all- in-one smartcards. Nevertheless, it would be a profound mistake to not understand el Campo as the heavily networked place it is, just as Occupy Sandy’s distribution centres were.</p> <p>These are intensely technologised sites, places where the shape of action and possibility are profoundly conditioned by what I call the “dark weather” of the network – that layer of information that swirls around the physical environment, intangible to the unaided human sensorium but possessing terrific potency. It’s simply that in both these cases, the sustaining interactivity was for the most part founded on the use of mature technologies, long deglamorised and long settled into what the technology-consulting practice Gartner refers to as the “<a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp\">trough of disillusionment</a>”. </p> <p>The true enablers of participation turn out to be nothing more exciting than cheap commodity devices, reliable access to sufficiently high- bandwidth connectivity, and generic cloud services. These implications should be carefully mulled over by developers, those responsible for crafting municipal and national policy, and funding bodies in the philanthropic sector.<br /></p> <p>In both these cases, ordinary people used technologies of connection to help them steer their own affairs, not merely managing complex domains to a minimal threshold of competence, but outperforming the official bodies formally entrusted with their stewardship. This presents us with the intriguing prospect that more of the circumstances of everyday urban life might be managed this way, on a participatory basis, by autonomous neighbourhood groups networked with one another in something amounting to a city-wide federation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"852ea5834e04bed5f4cda33c19ca1ea38573da35\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/19/1418988762170/e91f4917-abc4-4db1-bddf-e3ebb3430a30-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An Indian man pulls a cycle rickshaw near the Jama Masjid mosque in New Delhi, India.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The true intelligence of Delhi and all other cities starts with the people who live and work there.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernat Armangue/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In order to understand how we might get there from here, we need to invoke a notion drawn from the study of dynamic systems. Metastability is the idea that there are multiple stable configurations a system can assume within a larger possibility space; the shape that system takes at the moment may simply be one among many that are potentially available to it. Seen in this light, it’s clear that all the paraphernalia we regard as the sign and substance of government may in fact merely constitute what a dynamicist would think of as a “local maximum”. There remain available to us other possible states, in which we might connect to one another in different ways, giving rise to different implications, different conceptions of urban citizenship, and profoundly different outcomes.<br /></p> <p>The sociologist <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/bruno-latour.html\">Bruno Latour</a> warns us not to speak airily of “potential”, reminding us that we have to actually do the work of bringing some state of affairs into being before we can know whether it was indeed a possible future state of the system – and also that work is never accomplished without some cost. I nevertheless believe, given the very substantial benefits we know people and communities enjoy when afforded real control over the conditions of their being, that whatever the cost incurred in this exploration, it would be one well worth bearing. </p> <p>The evidence before us strongly suggests that investment in the unglamorous technologies, frameworks and infrastructures that are already known to underwrite citizen participation would result in better outcomes for tens of millions of ordinary Indians – and would shoulder the state with far-less onerous a financial burden – than investment in the high-tech chimeras of centralised control. The wisest course would be to plan technological interventions to come on the understanding that the true intelligence of the Indian city will continue to reside where it always has: in the people who live and work in it, who animate it and give it a voice.</p> <p><em>This text was commissioned by LSE Cities for the <a href=\"http://lsecities.net/ua/\">Urban Age</a> newspaper, to coincide with the Governing Urban Futures conference held in Delhi in November 2014.</em><br /></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/22/the-smartest-cities-rely-on-citizen-cunning-and-unglamorous-technology","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2014/dec/22/the-smartest-cities-rely-on-citizen-cunning-and-unglamorous-technology","sectionName":"Cities"},{"webTitle":"What were your biggest technology stories of 2014?

Half of all Americans would climb aboard. Brain implants? Nearly 30% are open-minded. In-vitro meat grown in a laboratory? Hold the burger.</p> <p>Only two out of 10 Americans are willing to give lab meat – animal tissue grown without a living host – a go, according to <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/04/US-Views-of-Technology-and-the-Future.pdf\">a Pew Research Center poll</a>. A fondness for things high-tech doesn’t transfer easily to the dinner plate, it seems.</p> <p>Despite this queasiness over heavily modified food (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/science/strong-support-for-labeling-modified-foods.html?_r=0\">a recent New York Times poll</a> found more than 90% of Americans want GMOs labeled), a new era of so-called “extreme” genetic engineering is already dawning in grocery aisles.<br /></p> <p>The technology is developing so rapidly that making a distinction between different types of genetically modified foods can be tricky. While genetically modified organisms have had their DNA sequences changed, typically by having traits of another species spliced in with their own, synthetic biology, or simply “synbio,” involves the creation of entirely new organisms with DNA sequences created from whole cloth on a computer. These organisms, typically bacteria or algae, are used to produce valuable commodities such as flavorings and oils.</p> <p>Research and development on these products is currently kept largely under wraps. Companies are closely guarding the technology – and perhaps the fact that they’re using it at all. Orange and vanilla flavors are currently being marketed and sold, but sellers are not identifying the companies using them and the companies are not identifying themselves.</p> <p>Though only beginning to enter the market, the general distrust of high-tech foods threatens to bite those companies investing in synbio. Success will require embracing transparency and explaining to consumers the benefits of the new technology.<br /></p> <p>“There is always anxiety about change,” says Mark Post, who leads a team at the <a href=\"http://culturedbeef.net/\">Cultured Beef project</a> at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. “When it’s a more radical change the anxiety is bigger.”</p> <p>Last year, Post’s group rolled out the first ever lab-produced burger to the public to a predictable flurry of “frankenburger” headlines over the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/lab-grown-beef-taste-test-almost-like-a-burger/2013/08/05/921a5996-fdf4-11e2-96a8-d3b921c0924a_story.html\">$330,000 five-ounce burger</a> grown from stem cells.</p> <p>The only way through such bad press, says Post, is openness: “I think it’s important in a high-tech solution to a real-life problem that you are absolutely 100% transparent in what you are doing.”</p> <h2>The problem with secrecy</h2> <p>The importance of transparency is echoed by Andras Forgacs, co-founder and chief executive of Brooklyn-based startup Modern Meadow, which hopes to one day sell in-vitro meat to the public. “We’re asking for a lot of trust from the consumer,” <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/07/laboratory-beef-leather-modern-meadow-brooklyn-horizons\">he told the Guardian</a> last month. “The more consumers understand how we do what we do, the better. That includes more transparency and more labeling.”</p> <p>Synbio was developed largely out of a quest for algae-based biofuels. As that challenge has proven difficult to commercialize for reasons of cost and scale, those same companies are increasingly pivoting to target more immediately lucrative consumer markets. </p> <p>Fragrances and extracts, as well as soaps and lotions, already contain synthetically derived biological products. Consumers would likely protest if they knew about them, says Dru Oja Jay, a spokesperson for the ETC Group, an international watchdog organization tracking the impact of new technologies on human rights and ecological diversity.</p> <p>“What we’re talking about here is the wholesale creation of new organisms – and also doing it at the single-cell level that creates a lot of issues when it comes to containment,” Jay says.</p> <p>It’s not always clear where these products are. Company marketing efforts don’t always help, either.</p> <p>For many companies, the omission of the term “synthetic biology” from their promotional materials has been an intentional decision due to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/jul/08/what-syn-a-name\">fears of negative consumer reaction</a>.</p> <p>But whatever novelty the sector commands is front and center at the website of <a href=\"http://ginkgobioworks.com/\">Ginkgo BioWorks</a>, which bills itself provocatively as “The Organism Company” and whose phone number’s alphanumeric translates as “Hack DNA.” The company boasts that it owns and operates the world’s first “organism engineering foundry”, the products of which endeavor to “replace technology with biology”.</p> <p>Ginkgo’s website reveals deals for eight chemical fragrances, sweeteners and flavors grown inside yeast cultures. If successful, the shift from biofuel development to the consumer market will mean the company will be able to push beyond biofuel’s $1-per-kilogram value to products valued at as much as $10,000 per kilogram, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/synthetic-biology-firms-shift-focus-1.14602\">according to the journal Nature</a>. The company’s customers are not named.</p> <p>The Swiss biotech company Evolva produces synthetically derived vanillin believed to be entering the food supply, though the end users have not been made public. Future offerings are expected to include synthetically derived saffron, stevia, and resveratrol.</p> <h2>Opening the doors to consumer interest</h2> <p>Green-products company Ecover became the first company to publicly announce its allegiance to an algal oil produced by biotech company Solazyme, a decision that quickly <a href=\"http://www.syntheticisnotnatural.com/\">generated a consumer campaign</a> intended to quash the deal. While the campaign calls the oil “synbio-derived”, Solazyme claims that’s untrue because the algae was only genetically modified to increase production of an oil it naturally produces, not to produce chemicals it doesn’t naturally produce. </p> <p>That hasn’t stopped the petition drive from getting 11,235 signatures. And a harder press by the public would likely follow the release of the company’s two new Solazyme food streams: a “lipid-rich” flour capable, <a href=\"http://solazyme.com/solutions/food/?lang=en\">according to the company’s website</a>, of replacing dairy fat, egg yolks, and oil in recipes, and an algae-based “non-allergenic, gluten-free and sustainable source of high-quality protein”.</p> <p>San Francisco-based Solazyme, manufacturer of Ecover’s new cleaning agent, also sells into Sephora’s beauty line. And Unilever announced in April that it was using Solazyme oils in its popular Lux soaps, <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/mediacentre/pressreleases/2014/UnileverformulatesfirstsoapbarusingsustainableAlgalOils.aspx\">skipping any reference to GMOs or synbio</a>.</p> <p>Interview requests sent to Solazyme and Ecover were not returned by press time.</p> <p>To gain public acceptance, synbio companies must also sell the benefits of their offerings to a public that is still largely ignorant of the industry’s existence. Three out of four Americans know virtually nothing about the technology, <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/synthetic-biology-remains-a-mystery-199123671.html\">a recent survey found</a>.</p> <p>“Generally, we find that people tend to be suspicious when you try to refute what they already believe,” says Lars Perner, assistant professor of clinical marketing at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business.</p> <p>“What tends to be more effective is trying to add beliefs. So you may talk about how you make some of this food affordable. Or you could talk about the convenience.”</p> <p>Paul Winters, director of communications for the <a href=\"http://www.bio.org/\">Biotechnology Industry Organization</a>, a trade group supporting the biotech sector, says the industry does a good job on this front. “If you look at the headlines in general for synthetic biology, they are still overwhelmingly positive.”</p> <p>Unilever and Ecover both say they adopted Solazyme’s oils in an attempt to eliminate their reliance on damaging palm oil. And a protein source such as Solazyme’s might reduce reliance on livestock for meat. While healthy vegetarian diets don’t require any such manipulated foodstuffs, the desire for meat continues to grow despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet\">UN support for vegetarianism</a>.</p> <p>Alternative protein sources have a strong case to make for themselves, and plenty of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/05/seaweed-burgers-snack-meat-consumption-resources\">novel startups</a> hope to lend a hand.</p> <p>To bring climate change to heel, global meat production – responsible for as much as 14.5% of global greenhouse emissions, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197608/icode/\">according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization</a> – must be dramatically curtailed or significantly transformed.</p> <p>“You can make [consumers] understand there are problems with meat production the way it’s being practiced now,” Maastricht University’s Post says. “Most people either consciously or subconsciously know they may not know everything about it, and may not want to know all about it.”</p> <h2><strong>The labeling advantage</strong></h2> <p>While Americans are “inclined to let others take the first step” with fast-evolving food technologies, as the Pew Research Center survey found, they generally have a laissez-faire attitude about regulating it – good news for producers of potentially polarizing products.<br /></p> <p>“The apathy toward things political, including the regulatory, is just rampant,” says Bryan G Norton, professor emeritus at the Georgia Institute of Technology’s school of public policy.</p> <p>That “laziness doesn’t mean companies shouldn’t label their products, however.</p> <p>“Providing that opt-out is actually a confidence-building strategy,” says Paul Thompson, who holds the WK Kellogg chair in agricultural, food and community ethics at Michigan University. “It actually is very much in the interests of the industry to accompany [regulation] with options so that people can opt out even if it’s irrational to opt out.”</p> <p>Rather than earning the public’s trust, disclosure practices like labeling are about not provoking distrust, Thompson says. When choice is stifled, resentment grows, leading in some cases to an “overstatement of risk” by the public in proportion to the sense of powerlessness they feel over their ability to make informed choices.</p> <p>“From industry’s perspective, it’s not that this will win you trust, friends and warm feelings so much as it’s a defensive strategy that avoids distrust, enemies and overt forms of political opposition,” he says.</p> <p>Labeling is something company heads have discussed, though it’s by no means universally supported.</p> <p>“There are some companies and researchers that say synthetic biology should be labeled proudly ‘synthetic biology inside,’ the way you would Intel Inside,” says BIO spokesperson Winters. “Obviously that would be a voluntary label.”</p> <p>Label or no, all food companies want to avoid getting stuck in the position of having to defend their product’s safety.</p> <h2><strong>A ‘precautionary’ approach</strong></h2> <p>Whatever direction synbio outfits head in their marketing campaigns, a fight is brewing. It’s one that will be shaped by public discourse on food options in light of the ecological pressures brought by world populations and rising affluence.</p> <p>“That may be sort of a counterbalancing factor here,” says Perner. “People may not be particularly thrilled about these artificial approaches, but the benefits may outweigh the costs.”</p> <p>In 2012, more than 100 environmental, religious and consumer advocacy groups <a href=\"http://libcloud.s3.amazonaws.com/93/ae/9/2287/2/Principles_for_the_oversight_of_synthetic_biology.pdf\">called for a moratorium</a> on the commercial release of synbio products until regulations guiding the technology are developed.</p> <p>Last month, representatives of 194 member states making up the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity called for all member nations to <a href=\"http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/cop/cop-12/insession/cop-12-L-24-en.pdf\">take a “precautionary” approach</a> to synbio development and only approve such products for field trials “after appropriate risk assessments have been carried out”.</p> <p>“There’s going to be a big fight about it, I think,” says Jay. “You’re talking about something that is completely transformative and, to use the business lingo, disruptive.”</p> <p>Though Norton says the public overwhelmingly favors agriculture of the more traditional variety, exactly where consumers will ultimately draw the line on synbio – already in everything from medicine and fuel to packaging and food – is impossible to forecast.</p> <p>Caution is the watchword for many.</p> <p>“It’s very difficult, in light of the way we think about food risks, to stand up and say something is absolutely safe and that there’s no risk,” Thompson says. “Food risk is very complicated. It’s not clear that any of the things we eat or have traditionally eaten are safe.

We need to do what we can to support them in their educational endeavours — even in means considered to be non-traditional. Mobile learning might be one way we can support young mothers when school interruptions occur due to early pregnancy. Here are some of my thoughts which draw upon the Kenyan context.</p><h2>Schooling and early pregnancy in Kenya</h2><p>With a <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/13/69\" title=\"\">high rate</a> of early pregnancies among women in Kenya, female children in both primary and secondary school are increasingly being affected. One of the most damaging side effects of this phenomenon in Kenya is that once pregnant, many girls face barriers such as a lack of awareness among school administrators about laws on early pregnancy and schooling, severe time constraints due to care work, and even familial beliefs that deny them the right to continue their education.</p><p>Recently, speaking on <a href=\"http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000092701&amp;story_title=give-pregnant-girls-a-chance-says-kaimenyi\" title=\"\">education reform</a>, cabinet secretary for education, science and technology in Kenya Jacob Kaimenyi drew attention to the difficulties that girls face when they want to return to school after having a baby. Although there is no policy in place that restricts a girl's ability to rejoin her peers in school, many girls <a href=\"http://www.worldywca.org/YWCA-News/World-YWCA-and-Member-Associations-News/Empowering-Adolescent-Girls-and-Teenage-Mothers-in-Kenya\" title=\"\">drop out</a> or are sent home when the pregnancy is discovered, are <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org/2011/11/sub-saharan-girls-held-back-child-marriage-and-violence\" title=\"\">turned away</a> when they try to return to school after giving birth, or are refused the chance to try and return because of <a href=\"http://plan-international.org/where-we-work/africa/kenya/about-plan/news/society-cultural-prejudices-a-key-barrier-to-continued-education-among-pregnant-teen-girls2019-in-kilifi-kenya/\" title=\"\">the stigma</a> the pregnancy and subsequent birth places on the girl and her family.</p><p>Commonly there <a href=\"http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/2382\" title=\"\">is a desire by girl learners to continue their education</a>, especially their formal education, despite their pregnancy even when the barriers to returning to school imposed by their families or schools and social stigmas may not easily permit it. Awareness-raising campaigns about the rights of young mothers, such as the girl declaration, can undoubtedly help address issues surrounding access to education by young mothers. Nevertheless, problems persist, and for girls out of reach or otherwise unable to benefit from these mechanisms, mobile phones could offer learning support.</p><p>Despite the <a href=\"http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/07/24/12909129-kenyans-use-cell-phones-for-everything-from-buying-groceries-to-paying-rent?lite\" title=\"\">use of mobiles in a number of facets of Kenyan society</a> (banking, utilities, retail, health, transportation, etc), their use in education remains limited to a few offerings such as <a href=\"http://enezaeducation.com/\" title=\"\">Eneza Education</a> (mostly secondary) and <a href=\"http://e-limu.org/\" title=\"\">eLimu</a> (mostly primary).</p><p>Some of the oft-repeated challenges to mobile learning as a viable vehicle for education include the costs associated with ownership and maintenance of the devices, fears of inappropriate use, and the <a href=\"http://www.ictworks.org/2011/12/09/have-mobile-phones-and-mlearning-failed-education/\" title=\"\">alleged</a> difficulty of reading on the devices with small screens.</p><p>While a <a href=\"http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/kenya-mobile-phones-nigeria-pop-musicians/1671589.html\" title=\"\">study from Kenya</a> indicated that some may go without food to own and maintain a mobile device, the device is often used to improve its owner's life, making the costs spent on its usage long-term investments. Eneza Education and <a href=\"http://www.gmaarifa.com/how_we_do_it.html\" title=\"\">gMaarifa</a> demonstrate that high-end mobile devices and smartphones are not a necessary prerequisite for mobile learning in Kenya, since both organisations' approaches to mobile learning do not require more expensive mobile tools.</p><p>Inappropriate use of mobile devices is a common issue <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/cyberbullying-increases-in-line-with-mobile-phone-usage-infographic/14713\" title=\"\">around the world </a>among youth. Perceived and real problems can range from contacting a member of the opposite sex to cyberbullying. Yet, a knee-jerk reaction to this challenge is to ban youth mobile use altogether. Educating Kenyan girls — and their families — on potential pitfalls and guiding them to use mobile devices appropriately is more sensible, especially when they are likely to find a way to use the devices anyway. But we do not see many mobile learning initiatives globally making this an integral part of their approach, to the detriment of any possible long-term success.</p><p>Helping to dispel the notion that reading on mobiles is difficult, Worldreader <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/ICT/pdf/Worldreader.pdf\" title=\"\">adds evidence</a> that reading in Kenya, even on small feature phones and eReaders, can be enjoyable and beneficial to young learners.</p><p>Education is key for marginalised girls (such as young mothers) to participate in all domains of the societies they live in. If an overarching goal for Kenya is to cultivate a knowledge economy, then more avenues of obtaining this knowledge need to be opened up for young mothers, a group that can <a href=\"http://www.ungei.org/news/247_2165.html\" title=\"\">contribute substantially</a> to development efforts if given access to education.</p><p>Young mothers of school age in Kenya make ideal beneficiaries of mobile learning opportunities when they experience school interruptions because they have a strong need for flexibility when juggling the demands of child rearing, are not always able to attend school even if they are permitted to return, do not always have consistent or affordable access to formal education or computers, may feel embarrassed to return to school after giving birth, and can make use of the mobile literacy skills they gain to pursue income-generating activities, if needed.</p><h2>What subjects can young mothers access through mobile-based instruction?</h2><p>When girls leave school after becoming pregnant or are unable to return after giving birth, the stigma of exclusion compounds their marginalisation. But we are seeing encouraging signs of possible future support in bridging the home-school divide at the primary and secondary level with educational technology. Through mobile devices, we have seen a number of subjects taught including maths (<a href=\"http://drmath.meraka.csir.co.za/drmath/\" title=\"\">Dr Math</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/29/m4girls-pilot-project-uses-nokia-6300-handsets-to-teach-math/\" title=\"\">M4Girls</a>), mother tongue languages (eTaleem, <a href=\"http://www.et4d.com/work/\" title=\"\">MoToLi</a>), science (<a href=\"http://www.text2teach.org.ph/?page_id=2\" title=\"\">Text2Teach</a>), sexual health &amp; HIV/Aids prevention (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2012/dec/05/breaking-sexual-health-taboos-in-nigeria\" title=\"\">education as a vaccine</a>), and life skills (<a href=\"http://www.learningaboutliving.org/south/online\" title=\"\">learning about living</a>).</p><p>For young mothers in Kenya, having support to access education at a distance, in the subjects above, which will be critical to their success as they grow into adults, should be viewed as a right and not a luxury. Mobile learning can be one medium to help realise this right. Nevertheless, even when this approach is undertaken, practitioners and educators must ensure they work to involve the girls' communities in the transformation process. <a href=\"http://plan-international.org\" title=\"\">Plan International</a> has a number of resources for how community involvement in support of girls can be mobilised, including identifying community members who can be girl child champions.  After all, it takes a village to raise a child.</p><p><em>Ronda Zelezny-Green is a member of the </em><a href=\"http://www.ict4d.org.uk/%E2%80%8E\" title=\"\"><em>ICT4D collective at Royal Holloway, University of London</em></a><em>.
