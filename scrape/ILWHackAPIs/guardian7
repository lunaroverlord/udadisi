The franchise is believed to be the first focused on livestock services created by an NGO.</p><p></p><p>Over the last 30 years, animal healthcare services in Africa have been hit as funding for agriculture has been cut by donors, despite the vital role livestock play for smallholder farmers, providing meat and dairy products and helping with transport, as well as being sold to raise money.</p><p></p><p>During <a href=\"http://www.lidc.org.uk/news_detail.php?news_id=112\" title=\"\">a panel discussion on maximising business opportunities</a> in African agriculture on Monday, Lord Sainsbury, the former science minister, criticised policies imposed by the World Bank and the IMF for the reduction in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_extension\" title=\"agricultural extension services\">agricultural extension services</a> across the continent, which has left many countries with no services to support farmers. In Kenya, veterinary services were scaled back in the 1980s, which hit services in remote areas particularly hard.</p><p></p><p>The franchise stores, which will be overseen by Farm-Africa, will be run by local vets or livestock technicians (animal healthworkers who have received some medical training, and are more likely to work in rural communities), who will have undergone a tough selection process to assess their commitment to the communities in which they will be working and to ensure they can maintain high standards across the network.</p><p></p><p>Each store will provide a one-stop-shop offering diagnostic advice and information on disease outbreaks, as well as providing clinical services, animal feeds and branded drugs. A lack of regulation means Kenya has a thriving market in unqualified and illegal traders who supply and sell fake or out-of-date products to farmers. The franchise network will also provide a nationwide infrastructure for the delivery of vaccines developed by <a href=\"http://www.galvmed.org/about-galvmed\" title=\"\">GALVmed</a>, a global alliance of public, private and government partners that makes affordable livestock vaccines and medicines available to farmers. Farm-Africa is a GALVmed partner.</p><p></p><p>Word of the network is already beginning to spread around Kenya, and people have been \"beating down the door\" to join, said Christie Peacock, formerly chief executive of Farm-Africa, but now the chair of the new enterprise, which has yet to be named. \"Essentially they will run their own business, but under a single brand,\" she says.</p><p></p><p>Farm-Africa has held talks with researchers, who see the project as a way to get their ideas tested in \"all corners of Kenya\", and with companies who may be able to offer affordable life and livestock insurance through the network.</p><p></p><p>\"This new approach to delivering services in rural areas is sustainable and we anticipate it will be scalable across Africa,\" said Peacock.</p><p></p><p>\"The huge potential of the country's livestock sector must be supported through modernisation, appropriate technology and improved access to high quality animal health services… The livestock sector provides impetus for economic development.\"</p><p></p><p>Esther Syengo, a farmer and buck-keeper from Nzeluni division in Migwani district, central Kenya, is optimistic about the new network. \"A few years ago a rabid dog attacked one of my goats. It took 14 days to have the goat vaccinated. The delay was caused by difficulties in getting one rabies dose as the vaccine is packaged in several doses,  and also [it is not] available to our village and neighbouring ones. From the look of things and going by what Farm-Africa has done in the past, this project should be able to bring a wide variety of drugs closer to us and at reasonable prices.\"</p><p></p><p>The franchise is being funded through a $5m grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2011/1/20/1295529027204/MDG--Kenya--veterinarian--003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/jan/21/farm-africa-animal-healthcare-franchise","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2011/jan/21/farm-africa-animal-healthcare-franchise","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Global Peace Index 2010: how does each country compare over time?

The <a href=\"http://www.visionofhumanity.org\">Global Peace Index</a>, published by the <a href=\"http://www.economicsandpeace.org/\">Institute for Economics &amp; Peace</a>, is a bold attempt to do so.</p><p>It's made up of 23 indicators, ranging from a nation's level of military expenditure to its relations with neighbouring countries and the level of respect for human rights. The index has been tested against a range of potential \"drivers\" or determinants of peace—including levels of democracy and transparency, education and national wellbeing. The data comes from various sources, including the <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/\">International Institute of Strategic Studies</a>, The <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/\">World Bank</a>, various bits of the UN offices and Peace Institutes and the <a href=\"http://www.eiu.com/public/\">Economist Intelligence Unit</a>.</p><p>The index provides a unique insight into peace around the world. Last year's 2010 data shows that:</p><blockquote><p>• Overall, the world has become slightly less peaceful since 2007, with 62% of countries recording decreases in levels of peacefulness<br />• The big risers are: Ethiopia, Mauritania, Hungary, Lebanon and Haiti (despite the earthquake)<br />• Falling are: Cyprus, Russia, Philippines, Georgia and Syria</p></blockquote><p><br />Intriguingly, the index also finds the monetary value of peace: they estimate that for 2006-2009, the world could have saved $28.2tn from the cessation of violence. </p><p>The 2011 GPI is out in May this year - but we have the <a href=\"#data\">data going back to 2007</a> below.</p><p>It's one of a number of indicators available, such as Transparency <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/oct/26/corruption-index-2010-transparency-international\">International's Corruption Index</a> which collectively build up a qualitative picture of

--><p><time>11.20am:</time> Good morning. We're back with the WikiLeaks blog. Here's a quick catch-up:</p><p>• In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/jan/13/wikileaks-latest-developments\">yesterday's blog</a> WikiLeaks <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/jan/13/wikileaks-latest-developments#block-9\">donated $15,100</a> to the Bradley Manning defence fund, the chair of the US House of Representatives homeland security committee wanted to put <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/jan/13/wikileaks-latest-developments#block-1\">WikiLeaks on a trade blacklist</a> and we published cables on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/jan/13/wikileaks-latest-developments#block-4\">a hotel in the Bahamas that had the US alarmed</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/jan/13/wikileaks-latest-developments#block-6\">what an Irish civil servant told US diplomats about alleged rendition flights</a> at Shannon airport.</p><p>• Plenty more cables were published, including close to 350 from Iceland. Non-Iceland headlines from recent releases include <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-13/u-s-says-italian-leaders-must-do-more-to-combat-mafia-wikileaks-shows.html\">US Says Italian Leaders Must Do More to Combat Mafia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mg.co.za/article/2011-01-13-wikileaks-mbeki-helped-draft-cope-policy\">WikiLeaks: Mbeki helped draft Cope policy</a> – that's Thabo Mbeki, the previous South African president; Cope is the Congress of the People, a breakaway ANC party. Cope has denied the leaked cable's claims.</p><p>• Slovenian philosopher <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n02/slavoj-zizek/good-manners-in-the-age-of-wikileaks\">Slavoj Žižek has a piece in the London Review of Books on WikiLeaks</a>. With a characteristic mix of popular culture (we don't just get Batman, but Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight) and references to such figures as Leo Strauss and Karl Marx, it asks how the whistleblower site challenges power structures:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>What WikiLeaks threatens is the formal functioning of power. The true targets here weren't the dirty details and the individuals responsible for them; not those in power, in other words, so much as power itself, its structure. We shouldn't forget that power comprises not only institutions and their rules, but also legitimate ('normal') ways of challenging it  [...] </p><p>However, it is a mistake to assume that revealing the entirety of what has been secret will liberate us. The premise is wrong. Truth liberates, yes, but not this truth</p></blockquote><p>You can add your thoughts in the comments.</p><p>• Someone has meanwhile written a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/drovics?feature=mhum#p/a/u/0/z_eood7DUwI\">folksy renegade number about Bradley Manning and put it on YouTube</a>.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><time>11.40am:</time> The Foreign Policy blog asks <a href=\"http://wikileaks.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/13/wikileaks_and_the_tunisia_protests\">if the Tunisia protests are the first WikiLeaks revolution</a>. Someone had to. (Though I notice Andrew Sullivan is <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2011/01/could-tunisia-be-the-next-twitter-revolution.html\">still on Twitter revolutions</a>.) This is what it says:</p><blockquote><p>We might also count Tunisia as the first time that WikiLeaks pushed people over the brink. These protests are also about the country's utter lack of freedom of expression – including when it comes to WikiLeaks.</p><p>Tunisia's government doesn't exactly get a flattering portrayal in the leaked State Department cables. The country's ruling family is described as \"The Family\" – a mafia-esque elite who have their hands in every cookie jar in the entire economy. \"President Ben Ali is aging, his regime is sclerotic and there is no clear successor,\" a June 2009 cable reads</p></blockquote><p>This is the cable: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/217138\">Troubled Tunisia: What should we do?</a></p><!-- Block 3 --><p><time>12.10pm:</time> Another <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/wikileaks-cables-you-ask-we-search\">You ask, we search cable</a>. <strong>Patrick Kingsley</strong> on the US and the <strong>Nepalese civil war</strong>.</p><p>US diplomatic tactics \"could result in Nepal becoming another Burma,\" Nepal's foreign minister claimed to the US ambassador at the height of the Nepalese civil war in 2005, according to a leaked state department cable.</p><p>Ramesh Nath Pandey told ambassador James Moriarty the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/47745\">US were not being supportive enough of then King Gyanendra</a>, and that this might indirectly lead to Maoist rebels taking over the country, a secret cable from December 2005 alleges. </p><p>At the time, Nepal was in the middle of a civil war between Maoist and government forces which dated back to 1996. Earlier in 2005, Gyanendra had complicated the situation by dissolving the democratically-elected government and taking direct control of the country – an act which US diplomats had criticised. The civil war eventually ended in 2006, when an elected parliament was re-established. In the 2008 parliamentary elections, Maoists came to power by a simple majority – and subsequently voted to abolish the monarchy. </p><p>According to the 2005 cable, Pandey felt the aggressive way the US manifested its support for Nepalese democracy would make Gyanendra less likely to relinquish power – and that this in turn would indirectly help Maoist insurgents. He suggested the US ambassador approach the king in a gentler fashion.</p><p>According to the cable, Pandey said \"the US had taken the wrong line in using pressure to try to force the King to take the right steps on multi-party democracy. Instead of using tactics that 'could result in Nepal becoming another Burma,' the US should encourage the King to move to multi-party democracy.  Pandey suggested that if the King knew he could depend on the US, 'things would be completely different'.\"</p><p>In response, Moriarty argued the US had been interested in \"a relationship based on trust\", but said \"the King had shattered that trust and needed to restore it by moving in the right direction.\" As such, Moriarty suggested \"the King should declare a cease-fire with international monitoring and reach out to the political parties in a real way.\"</p><p>Pandey countered that the leaders of the Nepalese political parties would not be amenable to such a gesture, and instead suggested encouraging middle-ranking political figures to take more of a leadership role.</p><p>In turn, Moriarty \"noted that Pandey's proposal would essentially involve decapitating the Parties and was unacceptable. He warned the FM that attempting to manipulate the internal workings of the political parties would not prove a successful strategy\".</p><p>• Make further You ask, we search requests with a tweet to <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/GdnCables\">GdnCables</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:newseditor@guardian.co.uk\">newseditor@guardian.co.uk</a>.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><time>3pm:</time> Several <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/national/for-lonely-teenager-assange-a-computer-was-his-only-friend-20110114-19rcq.html\">Australian papers</a> are running pieces on <strong>Julian Assange's early years</strong>. The new information has come to light through court documents requested by the Guardian as part of research for our soon-to-be published book <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/gnm-press-office/guardian-wikileaks-book\">WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's war on secrecy</a>. The documents entered the public domain today when they were unsealed in an open court in Victoria. </p><p>They tell the story of what the defence lawyer at Assange's 1996 trial on computer hacking charges called a \"really quite tragic\" childhood. </p><p>As a young boy, Assange lived like a nomad, constantly moving from home to home, attending at least 12 schools, as his mother Christine tried to flee from a violent boyfriend. \"His only friend\" was a computer his mother had bought him age 13, his defence lawyer Paul Galbally told the court. He added: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>He would reach a new community he would be ostracised, he would be . . . picked on, he would be bullied and his only real saviour in life or his own bedrock in life was this computer </p></blockquote><p>To this, the Guardian can add the poignant detail that Assange lists his absent father, named in the court documents as John Shipton, who he has never met, as the nominal owner of WikiLeaks. </p><p>His mother became pregnant by Shipton in her early 20s after she \"effectively ran away from home\" to Sydney age 17, the court documents say. They state that Shipton \"never took up residence or if he did only took up residence for a very short time\"  and \"has had no contact with the prisoner\".  At the time of the 1996 hearing, Assange was 25.</p><p>In October 2006 Assange first registered the domain name wikileaks.org with the Californian hosting company Dynadot. He gave the registrant's name as John Shipton.</p><p>In 2008 he re-registered Shipton's nominal address as Nairobi in Kenya, care of WIkileaks. Assange was living in Nairobi at the time and was locked in a legal fight with a Swiss bank, Julius Baer, who were trying to force Dynadot to cancel the registration and force the Wikileaks name off the internet.</p><p>The judge at the 1996 hearing, Judge Ross, described Assange as \"highly intelligent\". He refused to jail him and accepted that Assange had hacked into computers at Australia's National University, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and Nortel, a Canadian telecommunications company, in 1991 out of \"intellectual inquisitiveness\". There was no evidence he had acted for personal gain, the judge said.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><time>5.00pm:</time> A Dutch newspaper and the broadcaster RTL have <a href=\"http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/01/nrc_rtl_access_3000_wikileaks.php\">gained access to 3,000 cables</a> through Norway's Aftenposten, which was leaked the cables from an unknown source. The Hague is the source of all the cables in their possession and topics covered include Afghanistan, the joint strike fighter and Geert Wilders (we looked at Wilders <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2010/dec/13/wiki-leaks-you-ask-we-search\">here</a> and also the fraught Dutch debate about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2010/dec/15/wiki-leaks-you-ask-we-search\">joint strike fighter</a>.)

Explaining that mobile internet data allowances would be <del>capped</del> <em>\"aligned\"</em> to 500Mb (a sixth of the previous allowance for some Android customers), the company delivered a final kick in the balls with the following statement: <em>\"If you want to download, stream and watch video clips, save that stuff for your home broadband.\"</em></p><p>Not only is this a spectacularly retrograde attitude in 2011, it also makes their own advertising a bit of a joke, as at least one other person <a href=\"http://learn.open.ac.uk/mod/oublog/viewpost.php?post=54648\">has pointed out</a>. Compare and contrast the above statement with <a href=\"http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/shop/pay-monthly/htc-desire-hd/\">their blurb for the HTC Desire smartphone</a>, which welcomes customers to a brave new world where they can supposedly: <em>\"Download album art, artist reviews, YouTube<sup>TM</sup> videos and photos of artists. And you can buy tunes direct from Amazon.\"</em> </p><p>Just don't do it on your phone. Of course it would be unfair to single out my provider - other UK services now have similar caps, adding to the general impression that mobile broadband is <a href=\"http://www.ispreview.co.uk/story/2010/06/29/uk-mobile-broadband-users-afflicted-by-poor-connectivity-and-slow-speeds.html\">increasingly failing to live up to its earlier promise</a>. </p><p>Three years ago I had the opportunity to visit a small settlement on the banks of a minor tributary of the Amazon river in Brazil. The houses were spartan wooden shacks raised on stilts to avoid the regular seasonal flooding of the river (less predictable now, they complained, due to climate change), while the fertile grounds outside were dotted with small clusters of home-grown crops. </p><p>It was with some surprise that I entered one of these houses - a place that had taken a river ferry and some hours traversing dimly-lit mosquito-plagued jungle rivers in a canoe to reach - to find a Nokia mobile phone left casually on a window ledge. I checked it, and it even had reception, I noted, as my hosts stared at the red-faced sweaty European who looked like he'd never seen a mobile before and was clearly about to die from mosquito bites. </p><p>It's difficult to get across both the scale of the mobile revolution that has taken place in parts of the developing world over the last ten years, and it's sheer improbability. When I last visited Kenya, in 1998, much of the country outside Nairobi seemed like frontier territory, where breaking down meant a ten mile walk for help, and placing a call once you found a telephone could be a somewhat fraught experience. </p><p>I'll be going back there in March, and the country remains as poor as ever. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita\">The IMF rank</a> Kenya 150th out 182 countries by GDP per capita, and<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_Kenyan_crisis\"> the aftermath of the hotly disputed 2007 elections</a> saw violence and killing spread across the land, driving <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=25390&amp;Cr=Kenya&amp;Cr1\">thousands of refugees</a> into neighbouring Uganda.</p><p>And yet underneath the poverty and the violence, underneath the dusty savannah grass itself, thousands of kilometers of fibre-optic cables have been quietly snaking their way through the Kenyan soil, while forests of 3G masts have been springing up around every major urban area. In the last two years,<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/technology-11863225\"> three submarine cables</a> dropped in the Indian Ocean - Seacom, Teams and Eassy - have plugged the nation into the wider world and established Kenya as a major communications hub, East Africa's gateway to the internet.</p><p>In the process, <a href=\"http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/Kenyabusiness/Kenya-mobile-phone-subscribers-hit-19m-4590.html\">twenty million mobile phone subscriptions have been sold</a>, equivalent to more than <em>half </em>the population. More than 80% of the population have network coverage. The explosion in mobile phone use has driven Kenyans onto the world wide web for the first time, with 2.7 million internet subscribers who overwhelmingly use mobile devices to access the internet. This in a country where the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10505801\">average <em>annual </em>income is below £500</a>, and most live on less than seventy pence per day. </p><p>The sudden prevalence of this technology has had a profound impact on many areas of African life, with a dizzying array of services springing up around the new infrastructure transforming everything from personal finance to public health. Services like <a href=\"http://www.mukuru.com/\">Mukuru</a> allow Africans to easily transfer money via their phones; initiatives like <a href=\"http://www.biotech360.com/biotechArticleDisplay.jsp?biotechArticleId=100006\">Phones-for-Health</a> are assisting in the tracking of epidemics; the ability to form wider social networks for the first time has led to '<a href=\"http://www.crisscrossed.net/2010/02/06/sms-uprising-mobile-activism-in-africa/\">SMS activism</a>', with political activists using mobile phones to coordinate an inform large groups of aligned people; and <a href=\"http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/10669\">journalism has been transformed</a> by the ability to rapidly send text, sound and images back from far-flung locations. </p><p>So out of interest, and feeling a bit deflated about the size of my package,  I had a look to see what sort of data deal I could get from a Kenyan mobile operator. The very first one I came across was <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/index.php?id=1011\">Safaricom</a>. Given that one Kenyan Shilling is worth about 0.8p, I could get 750Mb of pay-as-you-go data use from them over a month for about £4.75. That compares with 500Mb for a fiver <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.co.uk/shop/mobile-phones/price-plans/pay-as-you-go/boosters/\">with my UK provider</a>. </p><p>Okay, the prices aren't really directly comparable, the quality of service probably is a bit better here for many people, and I don't want to sound like I'm starting a Daily Mail rant about 'third world hospitals'. But if a provider in one of the poorest nations on Earth can deliver 750Mb a month to mobile internet customers across creaking Kenyan infrastructure for such a small fee, then to me it seems a bit weird that customers in the UK are still getting messages like the one I started this post with.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2011/jan/11/1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2011/jan/11/1","sectionName":"Science"},{"webTitle":"Businesses step on board with offsets","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-07T13:22:45Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/offsetting-carbon-management-strategy-business","fields":{"body":"<h2>Last resort or most bangs per buck?</h2><p>Everyone agrees that offsets are only one tool available in the carbon cutting kit.</p><p>The question is: at what point is that tool wielded? Most argue that it should only be brought into action when other options have been exhausted.</p><p>For Iain Watt, climate expert at Forum for the Future, the guiding mantra is \"Avoid – Reduce – Replace. Avoid creating emissions in the first place, reduce them through energy efficiency, and replace high-carbon sources of energy with low- or zero-carbon ones. Offsetting may play an important part but it should not be the priority of your carbon management strategy.\"</p><p>Others stress that, once you've plucked the 'low-hanging fruit' in terms of emissions reductions at home, it can be perverse to spend large amounts on ratcheting them down just a little further, when the same money could achieve vastly greater reductions elsewhere in the world – and deliver all sorts of social benefits too.</p><p>Edward Hanrahan of <a href=\"http://www.jpmorganclimatecare.com/\">ClimateCare</a> cites one client (he won't name names) who was so fixated on the 'reduce first, then offset' hierarchy, that they spent a cool £80,000 on highly sophisticated lighting controls to cut a final 100 tonnes of CO2: an achievement that would have cost just £75 via offsets. \"If they'd spent their original budget on offsets, they would be a substantial net contributor to emissions reduction\".</p><p>Some companies, he suggests, have taken irrational decisions in an effort to appease 'offset sceptics', when they might have achieved more, both for the climate and their bottom line, by taking a more cool-headed approach to calculating the maximum potential carbon which could be saved per dollar invested – or, in other words, how to achieve the biggest bang for their available bucks.</p><p>At the <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\">Co-op</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/the-cooperative-paul-monaghan?INTCMP=SRCH\">Paul Monaghan</a> is keen to stress that offsets are only part of the picture. \"We are also doing a host of other things. Virtually all of our three thousand properties support a green electricity tariff. As part of this we've entered into long-term purchase agreements that guarantee new power generation is created, and have begun to erect wind farms on our farmland. We've also pioneered the use of micro-generation, and house the UK's largest applications of solar PV and micro wind.\" But he adds: \"To say you should only offset once all other options have been exhausted is daft: it's like saying waste recycling activities should be discouraged as they incite people to duck the higher imperative of waste minimisation.\"</p><p>Zelda Bentham of <a href=\"http://www.aviva.com/\">Aviva</a> agrees. \"Our view is that genuine reductions in carbon emissions to the atmosphere are beneficial – whether they come from a company's own operations, a compliance trading scheme or from voluntary (offset) projects that help economic progress in a more sustainable way.\"</p><p>Google, which has made a big splash with <a href=\"http://www.forumforthefuture.org/greenfutures/articles/Google_invests_in_clean_energy\">recent announcements</a> on investing in renewables, also sees offsets as part of its carbon reduction portfolio — despite the fact that it took until May of 2010 for the company to finish buying the credits for the energy it used back in 2007. Head of <a href=\"http://www.greenenergy.uk.com/\">Green Energy</a>, Bill Weihl, says this is because tracing carbon offsets back to particular projects and verifying that they actually reduce emissions — and by how much — is a tricky business.</p><p>At Forum for the Future, Deputy Director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/blog/sustainable-business-not-answer?INTCMP=SRCH\">Sally Uren</a> believes that \"it's important to look at carbon reduction per dollar invested. You can invest millions in a new manufacturing process and take 5% off your overall footprint – or you can invest the same sum in projects and deliver millions of tonnes of carbon savings.\" But she sounds a cautionary note. \"The priority is to reduce your baseline impacts as quickly and effectively as you can.\"</p><p>It's one echoed by Jonathon Porritt. \"Offsets have to be a major factor,\" he acknowledges, but they shouldn't be purchased purely because they deliver the biggest reductions per pound or dollar. The basic 'reduce first' hierarchy is sound, he says, because \"offsets alone will never get us to where we want to be. They must be seen as part of an integrated energy management strategy; and the main driver of that (where most companies are concerned) is energy cost and security of supply.\" If you neglect opportunities to cut emissions, then any amount of offset spending risks being dismissed as \"a gesture\", he warns.</p><h2>History, Geography </h2><p>It's all very well to cut emissions now – but what about those you've created in the past? They're still out there in the atmosphere, warming the world. Offsets are arguably the only option in the carbon management toolkit that can make amends. Imagine you've finally achieved a completely zero-carbon lifestyle – but that your cumulative carbon emissions in the past total, say, 250 tonnes. You can only credibly claim to be carbon neutral if you take action now to offset that total.</p><p>\"Because emissions are cumulative and historic\", argues <a href=\"http://www.jpmorganclimatecare.com/\">ClimateCare's</a> Edward Hanrahan, \"it's not enough to say 'Reduce: then Offset'. It should first be 'Offset' (to tackle your past emissions); then 'Reduce' (your present ones as much as possible), then 'Offset' (the remainder).\"</p><h2>Your emission is my emission</h2><p>Complacency is a dangerous thing. A year or so ago, British politicians were quietly congratulating themselves on achieving impressive cuts in carbon emissions. Until, that is, studies began to emerge showing that a significant chunk of carbon pumped out of factories in China and elsewhere was the result of meeting demand for consumer goods in the UK. It became all too clear that if emissions incurred in the production of imports are included in the national total, the picture is very different. It's hardly surprising. Much of what we consume is now produced abroad, and this applies particularly to carbon-intensive manufactured goods. So countries like China effectively emit on our behalf. This realisation has implications not just for Government, but for any company with an international supply chain. Globalisation is making a nonsense of national targets.</p><p>Businesses such as Marks &amp; Spencer are starting to realise this, says Iain Watt. \"Being neutral in the stores and offices is one thing, (but) now they're looking at how much carbon it takes to get a product on the shelves\", which includes assessing emissions from production and transportation. And then there are those incurred when the consumer puts it in her car and drives home. Such 'secondary' emissions are thought to be about ten times those incurred 'in house': so all the effort made to improve office and store efficiency and buy green energy is dwarfed by comparison.</p><p>Some companies are taking this approach a step further, says Watt, extending it to all operations upon which the company depends, internal and external: \"It's a broader, more holistic view of the issue, that takes into account the company's exposure to potential cost risk associated with carbon emissions\", he says.</p><p>For Paul Monaghan, this all strengthens the case for offsetting. \"The thing about the climate is that it doesn't give a jot where the carbon originates. Whether it's avoided in the UK, or offset in India, a tonne of reduction is a tonne of reduction is a tonne of reduction.\"</p><h2>Future positive?</h2><p>Whatever offsets' achievements to date, there's almost unlimited potential to achieve more. Their present contribution to curbing the vast amount of carbon emitted is just a drop in the ocean. In 2007-8, voluntary offsetting prevented around 25 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. During the same period, the US alone released around 6 billion tonnes…</p><p>Offset totals may be small now, but many observers believe we have barely scratched the surface. As carbon costs rise, driven by the UK government's long term emission reduction goals, says Jonathon Porritt, more and more companies will be keen to adopt policies that move them towards carbon neutrality. \"At the moment the market does not reflect the real price for carbon\", he says. \"The carbon price is so low it is not important to most companies\", but as the true costs are reflected and carbon prices rise, carbon offset volumes will, inevitably, continue to grow.</p><p>\"We simply are not going to hit our targets (without securing cuts elsewhere)\", he argues. And that means \"offsets must be a major factor\" in tackling emissions.</p><h2>Case studies</h2><p><strong>Aviva</strong></p><p>Last year, UK-based insurance company Aviva calculated its global CO2  emissions at 104,351 tonnes – and paid to offset it in its entirety. It added an extra 5% to drive carbon reduction above and beyond its own footprint. The bill came in at £620,000.</p><p>Over 100,000 tonnes may seem a lot – but it's down 20,000 against the 2006 baseline, thanks to a range of initiatives to reduce its impact. They include behaviour change (cutting out unnecessary travel through the use of teleconferencing, for example), introducing more efficient ICT systems, and buying electricity from renewable energy companies.</p><p>Aviva only buys offsets certified through the rigorous Gold Standard or Voluntary Carbon Standard schemes. Since 2006, approximately half of its spend has gone towards wind energy projects, avoiding over 220,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, with a further 100,000 tonnes offset through biomass and hydropower schemes.</p><p>The company favours projects in those countries where it has a market presence – which include the giants of East Asia (China, India, South Korea), and some 'developing' nations (from Romania to Sri Lanka), as well as some major European countries (France, Italy, Spain).</p><p>Supporting the development of clean energy is a good way to improve the prospects of communities vulnerable to climate change. But it's not the only way, Aviva believes. Funds raised through offset schemes also support projects aimed specifically at the rural poor: hence Aviva's purchase of credits generated by IDEI's <a href=\"http://www.forumforthefuture.org/greenfutures/articles/Offsets_open_doors\">treadle pump scheme</a>.</p><p>It has also purchased a total of 22,000 tonnes from CO2Balance, a Kenyan carbon management company that distributes super-efficient cookstoves which require 50% less wood than a traditional open fire. Kenya is not a country in which Aviva operates, but one it considers to \"suffer more from the effects of climate change, both in terms of speed and impact\" than most. The project not only reduces the number of trees felled for fuel, but has created over 200 new jobs in production. It also supports local industry by sourcing all materials used to build the stoves (bricks, cement and cast iron) in Kenya.</p><p>Such local, human-scale projects, says Zelda Bentham, Senior Environment Manager at Aviva, \"have a resonance with our employees\".</p><p><strong>Jaguar Land Rover</strong></p><p>Jaguar Land Rover offsets 100% of the CO2  emissions produced through its manufacturing assembly processes and, via a scheme launched in 2007, offers Land Rover customers the opportunity to offset the emissions of their first 45,000 miles – an option integrated at point of sale Jaguar customers can also choose to offset emissions via the Jaguar website.</p><p>\"We're in a position to invest in projects that would not otherwise get off the ground\", says Fran Leedham, Head of Environment and Sustainability, recognising the sheer weight of investment potential yielded by the group. \"But it's not a standalone thing\", she asserts. \"It's part of an integrated approach to carbon reduction.\"</p><p>Jaguar Land Rover is investing £800 million in research and development to improve the efficiency of its cars and manufacturing processes. But, with an average lead time of five years from the design of a car to its production, carbon offsetting enables the group to make an immediate difference. Jaguar Land Rover expects to offset around 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2012.</p><p>\"The scale of the offset scheme is very significant\", says Sally Uren, Deputy Director at Forum for the Future. \"It's not a permanent part of their carbon strategy\", she clarifies. \"It's a way for them to do their bit while the technology catches up.\"</p><p>Jaguar Land Rover's offset scheme supports emissions reductions projects in 14 different countries spanning Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and South America.</p><p>The portfolio includes the development of renewable energy sources, such as a wind farm in China and a series of small scale hydro plants in Tajikistan. These two initiatives combined are expected to avoid 150,000 tonnes of carbon emissions a year. The offset scheme also supports energy efficiency initiatives, such as low carbon lighting and cookstoves, as well as the promotion of new technologies that offer to reduce emissions in communities and industry alike.</p><p><strong>The Co-operative Group</strong></p><p>The Co-op takes \"a scientific approach, rather than a philosophical one\", says Paul Monaghan. Instead of buying offsets for image reasons, he says, it does so to bring it closer to achieving its goal of carbon neutrality.</p><p>Since 2000, the Co-op has offset over 400,000 tonnes of CO2. It raises funds for the scheme by pinpointing a few carbon-intensive things that its customers commonly do, such as driving a car, buying a home, or taking a flight.</p><p>As part of its mortgage scheme, the Co-operative Bank anticipates the carbon emissions of a household for the lifetime of the mortgage, and offsets one fifth of that total. The car insurance scheme works in a similar way, offsetting 20% of exhaust carbon.</p><p>The Co-operative Travel offers customers the opportunity to offset the carbon emitted through aviation fuel. This is part of a wider initiative to reduce the footprint of the Group's travel outlets by using electricity from renewable sources, as well as offsetting core management and funding research into sustainable tourism.</p><p>Then, in 2007, the Co-operative Insurance Services announced that it would \"go beyond carbon neutral\", offsetting 110% of all operational emissions, plus the impact of any unavoidable business travel.</p><p>The Co-op buys its offset credits through ClimateCare and, like Aviva, supports the treadle pump scheme. It funded the installation of over 61,000 treadle pumps in 2008, expected to result in 27,500 tonnes of avoided CO2 emissions over a five-year period. And it also backs the <a href=\"http://www.forumforthefuture.org/greenfutures/articles/Offsets_spark_change\">Cambodian cookstoves initiative</a>.</p><p>It only buys voluntary offsets from developing countries, says Monaghan, because the relative social benefits are normally much greater – and there is more certainty that the projects would not have gone ahead anyway (in other words, not fall at the 'additionality' hurdle).</p><p><em>Martin Wright is editor in chief of <a href=\"http://www.forumforthefuture.org/greenfutures/\">Green Futures</a> at Forum for the Future</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2007/09/07/offset2.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/offsetting-carbon-management-strategy-business","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/offsetting-carbon-management-strategy-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"Wayne McGregor CBE: the rock star of ballet steps up","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-02T00:03:05Z","sectionId":"stage","id":"stage/2011/jan/02/wayne-mcgregor-cbe-interview-jennings","fields":{"body":"<p>\"I was really surprised,\" says the choreographer Wayne McGregor, of the moment when he learned he was to be awarded a CBE in the New Year honours list. \"It was a real thrill. And it made me smile, a bit.\" The award was made in recognition of McGregor's outstanding services to dance, a field in which, in the past decade, he has become a world leader. He is choreographer-in-residence at the Royal Ballet, for whom he has produced a series of striking and critically acclaimed new works, and his own company, Wayne McGregor Random Dance, has an international reputation for cutting-edge performance. For the shaven-headed, gold-earringed choreographer, described by the<em> New York Times </em>as \"the closest thing to a rock star that ballet can currently claim\", it's been quite a journey. From being an outsider in his chosen field, itself an outsider discipline, McGregor is now a Commander of the British Empire. That he permits himself that smile is understandable.</p><p>McGregor, now 40, grew up in an \"utterly stable, utterly normal\" home in Cheshire, a fan of disco and the films of John Travolta. In 1991 he left Leeds University with a first class degree in dance, and after further training in New York secured a job with Redbridge council as dance co-ordinator, in which capacity, he remembers, \"I organised tea dances on Wednesday afternoons\". In 1992, having formed Random Dance, he choreographed a piece called <em>Xeno</em>, which was shown at the Place (the London School of Contemporary Dance). Just walking into the building, he remembers, was intimidating. \"It was this holy of holies, and having come up the community dance route I wasn't part of that world at all.\"</p><p>The Place took up <em>Xeno,</em> toured it through Europe, and on his return invited McGregor to become a choreographer-in-residence. He was the first such appointee not to have been trained there, and this, he says, was \"a very big deal for them. In five years I was never asked to teach, never asked to make a piece with the students. I was considered too dysfunctional.\" It wasn't until 1995, with a piece called <em>Cyborg</em>, that the dance world started to take serious notice of McGregor's work. <em>Cyborg</em> was his first foray into new-tech dance, a style which he would make wholly his own. Marrying the sinuosity of contemporary dance to a fractured postmodernism, the McGregor style was distinguished by its rattlesnake speed, flickering detail, and extreme and often distorted physical articulation. In it, you could see vestigial flashes of disco, techno, hip-hop and martial arts, as well as an echo of the work of post-structuralist choreographers like William Forsythe. Intensely zeitgeist-aware, McGregor borrowed from every area of exploration and practice. Computer technology, film theory, medicine, architecture; nothing was too arcane, or apparently distant from dance, to escape his questioning, magpie eye.</p><p>In the years that followed, Random Dance became McGregor's physical laboratory. Increasingly fascinated by the field of cognitive theory and its application to choreography, he undertook research projects with scientists at Cambridge University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of San Diego. Audience and critical reactions were mixed. Some found the resultant works abstruse and alienating, but others celebrated McGregor's brave new dance-world, and the awards and the commissions mounted.</p><p>By the new millennium, McGregor was working with the Royal Ballet, enjoying \"the extremity of line, the conformity, the detail, the precision\" of the classically trained dancers, and expanding his movement vocabulary accordingly.</p><p>His first main-stage work at Covent Garden was <em>Chroma</em>, in 2006, danced to a combination of original compositions by Joby Talbot and arrangements of music by Jack White of the White Stripes, and set in an all-white box of light by the minimalist architect John Pawson. The work presented the Royal Ballet's dancers in a strange, stark new context, and proved so successful that McGregor was invited by artistic director Monica Mason to be choreographer-in-residence with the company. Two further works for the Royal Ballet followed, <em>Infra</em> in 2008 and <em>Limen</em> in 2009, by which time he had also undertaken commissions for, among others, the Paris Opera Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet, La Scala Milan, English National Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet and Australian Ballet. In 2010, with the dark and ambiguous <em>Outliers</em>, he added the New York City Ballet to the list.</p><p>If the past few years have been busy, this year threatens to be even more so. January sees the Los Angeles and Moscow premieres of a work composed around the extraordinary talents of the Bolshoi wonderchild Natalia Osipova. \"She's amazing,\" enthuses McGregor. \"She's done very little contemporary work but took to it like a duck to water.\" In London, meanwhile, anticipation is building around a new Royal Ballet piece which launches in May. It will be danced to Michael Tippett's <em>Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli</em>, with designs by the artist John Gerrard, who creates virtual reality landscapes. The theme, McGregor says, is anti-war, echoing Tippett's pacifism, and will align the English pastorale of the music with a desolate wasteland of Gerrard's creation, based on an army-training area in Kenya.</p><p>In June <a href=\"http://www.operadeparis.fr/cns11/live/onp/Saison_2010_2011/Ballets/spectacle.php?lang=en&amp;event_id=1336&amp;CNSACTION=SELECT_EVENT\" title=\"\">a new full-evening McGregor work for Paris Opera Ballet </a>opens at the Bastille. Designed by John Pawson, who will divide the stage into a series of triptychs, the piece is about the painter Francis Bacon, and given McGregor's unsparing eye and predilection for the physically extreme, this would seem a perfect match of artist and subject. The score, by Mark-Anthony Turnage, is for a contemporary ensemble with jazz musicians. \"Bacon loved jazz,\" McGregor reflects. \"And the way he situates the body in space absolutely resonates for me.\"</p><p>The choreographer's commitments stretch into the future. In July McGregor is hosting a Sundance Institute Theatre Lab at a workspace he has created in Lamu, East Africa, and in November, at Sadler's Wells in London, he is directing Turnage's chamber opera <em>Twice Through the Heart</em> with designs by the artist Mark Wallinger. In 2012 he will be directing <a href=\"http://www.bigdance2012.com/\" title=\"\">the Big Dance</a>, a London-based community project, while commissions for 2013 include a new <em>Rite of Spring</em> for the Bolshoi Ballet. All of it, says McGregor, is part of his long-term aim \"to place dance in the real world. I've always been ambitious for dance, and this CBE makes that visible.\"</p><p>Senior dance-world figures agree. \"I am so thrilled for Wayne and feel that this honour is richly deserved,\" says Monica Mason, and Alistair Spalding, artistic director of Sadler's Wells, echoes her words: \"Wayne's radical approach to the creation of dance is absolutely essential to the future of the art form, so I am very glad that he has achieved such wide recognition.\" All of which raises a very serious question: is McGregor now an establishment insider?

Pride, energy and charm set the young couple instead on a path that led to the formation of&nbsp;Patak's, the biggest Asian food company in the UK, and altered the&nbsp;country's primitive notions of curry for ever.</p><p>The Pathaks had already left two countries to escape poverty and prejudice, and had no illusions about the challenge of&nbsp;starting again in 1950s Britain. They had built up a small sweet and spice trade in Kenya before fleeing the Mau Mau uprising with just £5 capital (about £100 today), and Shanta ordained that the business should start again, operating from the kitchen table of their flat in Kentish Town, in north-west London.</p><p>Her optimism and persistence sustained Laxmishanker's business sense, along with her cookery skills, which lay behind the first, simple jars and packets of Pathak products. British taste took a long time to come round, but by the late 50s they had saved enough money to buy a small shop behind Euston station. They opened another in Bayswater in 1961.</p><p>Commercial progress remained modest until 1972, but that year some 50,000 Ugandan Asians arrived in the UK, expelled by Idi Amin. Spurred by Shanta, the Pathaks bid for the contract to supply food to the refugee camps. They won and were praised for their exemplary work, which included giving advice and help on settling in the UK.</p><p>Thousands of the new immigrants found their own entrepreneurial feet in catering and repaid the Pathaks by turning to them for supplies. By the late 70s, the family was employing 500 people at a converted mill in Brackley, Northamptonshire, and supplying more than 7,500 British restaurants and many others in 40 countries.</p><p>The Pathaks' son Kirit, the oldest of four boys and two girls, took over control of the firm in 1976. Educated initially at a Catholic school, which gave him an Irish accent and a brief childhood ambition to be pope, he and his wife, Meena, a food technology graduate, raised turnover to £55m before selling the firm to Associated British Foods in&nbsp;2007 for an estimated £105m.</p><p>A devout Hindu, Shanta shared her husband's passion for understanding between ethnic communities in the UK and was closely involved in the family's charitable work. She was not able to prevent family quarrels, however, and was devastated when her daughters sued in 2004 to claim a larger share of&nbsp;the firm. A settlement was reached, but she did not forgive them for obliging her to give evidence in court.</p><p>Kirit described his mother as \"a huge inspiration, full of charisma and spirit\" whose flair had helped at every stage of the Pathaks' story. Born in Gujarat, India, she sailed to east Africa as a child when her parents sought a way out of poverty, and met Laxmishanker there.</p><p>She deferred to him in business, superficially, but was well aware of the value of marketing and persuaded him to drop the \"h\" from their name – a&nbsp;matter of some pride – to make their products easier to pronounce for the growing non-Asian British market. She&nbsp;also helped to tempt the film-maker Roland Joffé to make memorable TV advertisements which drew on British sentiment for the Raj.</p><p>Always the men's equal, she was effortlessly superior in the place that mattered most to the Pathaks' success. Kirit said: \"My mother was at her happiest in the kitchen and the fact her secret family recipes have remained largely unchanged speaks for itself.\"</p><p>Laxmishanker died in 1997. Shanta is&nbsp;survived by her children.</p><p>• Shanta Gaury Pathak, cook and entrepreneur, born 2 February 1927; died 23&nbsp;November 2010</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/12/31/1293810182890/Shanta-Pathak-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/31/shanta-pathak-obituary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/dec/31/shanta-pathak-obituary","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Our top countries of 2010 by tags","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-29T12:01:00Z","sectionId":"help","id":"help/insideguardian/2010/dec/29/top-countries-by-tags-2010","fields":{"body":"<p>There are times when tags divide opinion at guardian.co.uk, but when it comes to news, our tags split the world in two. There's the UK (represented by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk\">UK news</a> tag) and the rest of the world (represented by the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world\">World news</a> tag).</p><p>Of the 40,000 or so pieces of content we published this year tagged with one (and in 3,500 cases <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/world+uk/uk\">both</a>) of these tags, 22,500 or so were tagged UK news and 21,000 World news.</p><p>We can drill down into our 'rest of world' content and produce a report of all content published by us in 2010 for every country in the world apart from St Vincent and the Grenadines, for which we have no news content in the archive, and Vatican City, which is the only sovereign country we don't have a tag for.</p><p>We do have a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/vatican\">Vatican</a> tag, which is a <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/trends?q=holy+see%2C+vatican\">search friendly synonym</a> for the Holy See and, arguably, not quite the same thing as the Vatican City State.</p><p>We very definitely have a tag for the USA, and the table below tells us that it's the foreign sovereign state we care about most in the world (6,314 pieces of content tagged <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa\">US news</a>). Just under a quarter of this (1,465 pieces of content) was tagged <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics\">US politics</a>, most of which (1,182 pieces of content) was also tagged <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a>.</p><p>With more than 5,000 articles about subjects other than politics, our US coverage ranges from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jul/30/citigroup-us-bank-fined\">sub-prime</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/nov/24/punch-panda-new-york-artist\">ridiculous</a>.</p><p>Our diverse interest in the US is followed by more uniform coverage of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> (1,765 content items) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> (1,248). Those totals are bolstered by the War logs (389 on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-war-logs\">Afghanistan</a>, 292 on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq-war-logs\">Iraq</a>) and UK involvement in both countries (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan+uk/uk\">Afghanistan+UK news</a> 563, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq+uk/uk\">Iraq+UK news</a> 447).</p><p>If we were to subtract UK-related coverage from our totals for Afghanistan and Iraq, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\">China</a> would sneak into third place (1243, with only 83 tagged <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china+uk/uk\">China+UK</a>). Not surprising given its size and economic muscle.</p><p>Fourth place goes to the far smaller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel\">Israel</a> (1,008 content items, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel+uk/uk\">101 also tagged UK news</a>).</p><p>In case you were wondering, a little over a quarter (258) of our pieces on Israel were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel+tone/comment\">comment</a>, which isn't out of step with the general ratio of World news (21,000) to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/world+tone/comment\">World news comment</a> (3740).</p><p>So we're obsessed with our home country, captivated by the US and disproportionately preoccupied with Israel? Maybe. We also produced 604 pieces of content about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/apple\">Apple</a> (349 about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/iphone\">iPhone</a>, 331 about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/ipad\">iPad</a>).</p><p>(A colleague tells me that there are 1,252 mentions of the iPad on guardian.co.uk this year and 1,143 mentions of Cheryl Cole on the Mail online.)</p><p>But enough celebrity gossip, let's get back to using a big table to chart the geographical spread of editorial content.</p><p>On that other section of the site we call 'UK news', from our total of 22,500 pieces of content, 659 were tagged <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/scotland\">Scotland</a>, 553 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> and 222 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/wales\">Wales</a>. None were tagged England because we have no England news tag.</p><p>Is this because we don't distinguish between the UK and England when it comes to news? Not really. With only 1 in 15 of our UK news articles identifiably not-about-England, a standalone England page would look a lot like a UK news page.</p><p>We can drill a little deeper by counting the 1,585 pieces of content tagged <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london\">London</a> (even without our prolific <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/davehillblog\">London blogger Dave Hill</a>'s 604 contributions that's an impressive total). In 2010 we wrote more about London than we did about Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put together. (We're redressing some of this liberal London media-bias with our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/leeds\">Leeds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/cardiff\">Cardiff</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/edinburgh\">Edinburgh</a> blogs but as most of their content is local in flavour it will tend not to be tagged UK news.)</p><p>If there are no great surprises at the top of our list of 'news country tags by content in 2010', at least we can give some end of year exposure to those countries fighting relegation. (Not really, where would they go? What would they become? Members of the Blue Square premier league of nations?)</p><p>Four countries made a singular impact on us this year: Guinea-Bissau's prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/01/guinea-bissau-prime-minister-released\">Carlos Gomes Junior, was freed after an abortive coup</a>; fugitive from justice in the Dominican Republic, Jose Figueroa Agosto, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/18/drug-kingpin-pablo-escobar\">was finally arrested</a>; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/14/british-ski-tourist-dies-andorra\">a British tourist died in Andorra</a> and there was a late entry courtesy of the US embassy cables with '<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/150529\">Djibouti in talks to defuse Eritrea crisis</a>'.</p><p>We managed to find something to say about almost every country in the world this year. Those that remained unshaken and unstirred (at least from where we stand) were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/san-marino\">San Marino</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sao-tome-and-principe\">Sao Tome and Principe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/palau\">Palau</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/comoros\">Comoros</a>. I'd say please try harder and better luck next year, but maybe - and please remember that even the most expensive Christmas cracker contains a corny joke - <a href=\"http://instantrimshot.com/\">no coups is good news</a>.</p><p>Happy new year.</p><table>\n      <caption>\n            Countries by tags 2010\n          </caption>\n      <thead>\n        <tr><th class=\"bold left\">News country

earth metals mine is key to US control over hi-tech future","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-26T16:54:01Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2010/dec/26/rare-earth-metals-us","fields":{"body":"<p>It's a deep pit in the Mojave desert. But it could hold the key to America challenging China's technological domination of the 21st century.</p><p>At the bottom of the vast site, beneath 6 metres (20ft) of bright emerald-green water, runs a rich seam of ores that are hardly household names but are rapidly emerging as the building blocks of the hi-tech future.</p><p>The mine is the largest known deposit of rare earth elements outside China. Eight years ago, it was shut down in a tacit admission that the US was ceding the market to China. Now, the owners have secured final approval to restart operations, and hope to begin production soon.</p><p>\"We will probably never be the largest [mine] in the world again. It will be hard to overcome China's status in that regard, but we do think we will be a very significant supplier,\" Mark Smith, chief executive of Molycorp Minerals which owns the mine, told reporters during a tour of the site.</p><p>So far as the Obama administration is concerned, the mine can't open soon enough. A US department of energy report warned on 15 December that, in the absence of mines such as this one, America risks losing control over the production of a host of technologies, from smart phones to smart bombs, electric car batteries to wind turbines, because of a virtual Chinese monopoly on the rare earth metals essential to their production.</p><p>China controls 97% of global rare earth metals production. Such total domination of a strategic resource became impossible to ignore in October when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/oct/25/china-cuts-rare-earths-exports\" title=\"China cut exports of rare earth elements\">China cut exports of rare earth elements</a> by more than 70% over the previous year, disrupting manufacturing in Japan, Europe and the US. Prices of even the cheapest of the 17 rare earth elements rose 40%.</p><p>Now America, like Japan and Europe, is desperate to find alternatives. \"Reopening domestic production is an important part of a globalised supply chain,\" David Sandalow, the energy department's assistant secretary for international affairs told a seminar in Washington.</p><p>For Smith, the official recognition of the strategic importance of the metals was a long time coming. \"I've been going out to Washington DC every other week for about two years trying to tell the rare earths story,\" he said.</p><p>They are listening in Washington now. At the 15 December seminar at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, one PowerPoint presentation lingered on a slide that showed only the Chinese flag. The room filled with nervous laughter.</p><p>By 2015, global demand for rare earths is expected to reach 205,000 tonnes. \"If we don't get alternative supplies up and running we are going to have this supply gap that is going to cause a lot of issues,\" Smith said.</p><p>Those issues forced their way onto the government's agenda this autumn when China began squeezing raw material exports of rare earth minerals.</p><p>Some US media reports have speculated China is trying to use its control over the supply lines for political leverage. But a number of analysts say China is trying to get better control over an expensive, dirty and dangerous mining process, and to get more factories to set up shop inside the country.</p><p>Rare earths are extracted through opencast mining and generate radioactive waste.</p><p>\"I don't believe that China is trying to chop the west off at the knees but it has a growing internal market that is driving the demand,\" said Gareth Hatch, an analyst at Technology Metal Research. \"That reduces the amount they are willing to export.\" That is where Molycorp – the frontrunner for now in a global race to develop alternative production of rare earth materials – hopes to step in.</p><p>Since going public last July, the company has raised more than $500m (£323m) to expand its production facilities at Mountain Pass, a collection of rusting buildings that date from the 1950s. This month, Sumitomo Corp of Japan invested $130m in return for guaranteed supplies of rare earths for the next seven years. The company has also applied for department of energy loans.</p><p>By mid-2012, Molycorp aims to produce 20,000 tonnes a year of nine of the 17 rare earths or about 25% of current western imports from China. Smith suggested the company could possibly ramp up production to 40,000 tonnes within the next 18 months. He says Molycorp has exposed just 55 acres of the 2,200 acre site.</p><p>But even production on that scale may not be enough to guarantee the supply of metals needed to move to a clean energy economy: lanthanum for batteries for hybrid cars, neodymium for the permanent magnets for wind turbines, especially offshore, europium for energy efficient lighting.</p><p>\"You would need seven mines the size of Molycorp's just to meet the demand for wind turbines and that would mean no neodymium for motors or any other applications,\" said Jim Hedrick, who until last year was the rare earth expert at the US Geological Survey.</p><p>\"Obviously there is a demand for 10 or 20 mines through the world to meet all the different demands for these products.\"</p><p>Some companies, such as General Electric, are already moving to reduce their use of rare earths. \"What we are going to absolutely have to do is diversify our sources and optimise the use of these materials in manufacturing,\" said Steve Duclos, who heads GE's global research division.</p><p>In Japan, meanwhile, Hitachi has started a recycling effort to recover rare earths from hard drives and other materials.</p><p>Aside from raw materials, it is also unclear whether the US still has the expertise for the complicated process of turning minerals into usable clean tech components.</p><p>Such challenges were unthinkable half-a-century ago when prospectors looking for uranium stumbled instead on a rich deposit of rare earths about an hour's drive from Las Vegas.</p><p>By the 1960s, the mine was booming, largely through sales of europium, used to produce the bright red tones of colour televisions.</p><p>But prices fell as China came on the market, with its low production costs. A pipeline accident in the late 1990s, which leaked radioactive fluid into the desert and a nearby town, led to an expensive clean-up.</p><p>The mine closed in 2002. The central pit in the 55-acre site became a pool of bright green water. White bales of minerals – some mined eight years ago – were stockpiled until such time as prices would rise.</p><p>This time around, however, Molycorp claims it has a fighting chance against China, especially if it is able to meet its goal of complete mines-to-magnet processing at the Mountain Pass facility.</p><p>The company is also confident it can head off competition from a slew of new mines due to begin coming online from Australia, Wyoming, Quebec and South Africa. \"The growth in demand for these minerals is just phenomenal,\" Smith said. \"A 6% average growth rate for us would be very, very good but when you start adding things like hybrid vehicles and wind turbines to the rare earth sectors now you are talking about double digit growth, and you still don't know where that will end.\"</p><p>At this point, though, Molycorp is not even at the beginning. \"The road to the green world of the future starts from the black earth. But first you have to get the materials out of the ground,\" said Hatch. \"The whole clean-tech energy industry is hinging on it.\"</p><p>The \"rare earth elements\" are a group of 17 naturally occurring metallic elements used in small amounts in everything from high-powered magnets to batteries and electronic circuits. The materials (including scandium, yttrium and a group of elements called the lanthanides) have chemical and physical properties that make them useful in improving the performance of computer hard drives and catalytic converters, mobile phones, hi-tech televisions, sunglasses and lasers.</p><p>With global demand for hi-tech goods increasing the market for rare earth elements has doubled in the past decade.</p><p>Despite their name, rare earth elements are not actually all that rare, but China has a near-monopoly on mining the elements. In a report on the elements published this year, the British Geological Survey put their natural abundance on the same level as copper or lead.</p><p>According to the BGS China has 37% of the world's estimated reserves, about 36m tonnes, but controls more than 97% of production. The former Soviet bloc has around 19m tonnes and the US 13m, with other large deposits held by Australia, India, Brazil and Malaysia.</p><p>Other sources, untapped as yet, include Greenland. Estimates suggest the land mass could meet 25% of global demand for REEs. South Africa also has potential for rich REE deposits, as do Malawi, Madagascar and Kenya.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2010/12/26/1293374828714/Rare-earth-minerals-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/26/rare-earth-metals-us","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/dec/26/rare-earth-metals-us","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"WikiLeaks cables: Bulgarian nuclear project 'dogged by safety concerns'","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-20T23:00:00Z","sectionId":"us-news","id":"world/2010/dec/20/wikileaks-cables-bulgarian-nuclear-project","fields":{"body":"<p>One of Britain's biggest energy suppliers, which wants to build half a dozen nuclear reactors in the UK, helped develop one in Bulgaria which was \"dogged by ongoing serious safety concerns\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/215404\" title=\"\">according to leaked US diplomatic cables</a>.</p><p>The German firm RWE, which owns npower and supplies electricity and gas to 6.7 million UK customers, bought a 49% stake in the project in December 2008 and quit as a strategic partner in October 2009. RWE said its decision to pull out of the troubled €7bn reactor project was due to the fact that \"the project's financing could not be finalised within the agreed period\". It said \"safety issues were not a factor\".</p><p>But its involvement in such an apparently shoddy project, which the cables claimed \"reeked of side deals\" even before RWE bought the 49% stake, could hurt its reputation over safety and cast doubt on its judgment in selecting who to work with on reactor projects.</p><p>In December 2007, environmental groups including Greenpeace condemned the European commission's approval of the project. Approval came despite the former Bulgarian nuclear regulator publicly calling for it to be blocked on safety grounds the month before.</p><p>RWE said: \"RWE adheres to very strict safety standards and criteria. For each project RWE is involved in, safety has the highest priority. The reason for RWE to withdraw from the Belene project was that – because of the international economic and financial crisis – financing of the project could not be clarified in due time. RWE has advised our Bulgarian partners to the difficulties of financing already at an early stage.\"</p><p>The release of the cables comes amid growing safety concerns over an impending global \"nuclear renaissance\" with more than 1,000 reactors expected to be built by 2030, according to the World Nuclear Association. Countries which could turn to nuclear power for the first time include Albania, Bangladesh, Kenya, Venezuela and Syria.</p><p>In August 2008, RWE's CEO, Jürgen Grossmann, responded to questions about reports of its possible involvement in the over-budget and behind-schedule project: \"It is remarkable, isn't it, that the possible involvement of RWE in the construction of a new nuclear power plant in Belene, Bulgaria, based on state-of-the-art technology is being described as irresponsible.\"</p><p>The cables claim that despite its due diligence, RWE's confidence had turned to \"buyer's remorse\" within weeks. In the cable, the US ambassador cited local contacts as saying there was a rush to start construction so that the project would keep RWE on board. RWE had reportedly said that it would not provide funding until it sees the \"first concrete poured\", signalling the start of construction. Belene project experts privately expressed \"serious concerns\" that if safety practices continued to be ignored \"it could pose a huge risk\". RWE's partner, the state-owned Bulgarian electricity company, NEC, which held 51% of the project, declined to comment on any of the allegations.</p><p>RWE was said to be \"in the dark\" on most on-site and technical issues. This was despite a previous cable claiming that the company in February had demanded to review all Belene-related agreements.</p><p>The same February 2009 cable reported \"RWE worries about the project's lack of transparency and the need to work with Atomstroyexport [the Russian lead contractor]. RWE wants to enforce European business practices\". RWE was reported around that time to be in talks with a number of European energy groups, including Belgium's Electrabel, to offload half its stake but did not find any buyers. \"RWE realises that working with Russian and Bulgarian companies in the energy sector is a 'poisonous combination' for European investment\" the cable added.</p><p>The cable also reports: \"When Bulgarians talk about the Belene nuclear power plant, they increasingly do so in hushed tones. Issues of delays, financing woes, non-transparent horse-trading and side deals, Russian influence … and the interests of well-connected politicians and energy oligarchs inevitably come up.\"</p><p>RWE's statement continued: \"RWE's participation in projects guarantees a high degree of ethical business behaviour and openness to concerns of all stakeholders. We ensure that each project is in line with European standards with regard to transparency and information to the public. It is therefore common practice within all our projects that RWE's or a similar code of conduct will be applied. The same has been true for the Belene project for which a code of compliance was developed and should have been implemented; we would have thereby introduced dedicated instruments against corruption.</p><p>\"We have raised these issues with NEC and the Bulgarian government and they confirmed that this was a shared mutual understanding. RWE has signed a joint venture agreement with NEC in December 2008 after intense pre-assessment of the project. Under the joint venture agreement the companies involved agreed to jointly continue the project development work, and further advance the project.</p><p>\"The potential joint construction and operation of the new power plant would not have gone ahead until all relevant safety-related, legal, economic and organisational aspects had been settled during this phase.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/12/20/1292874829014/Npower-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/20/wikileaks-cables-bulgarian-nuclear-project","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/dec/20/wikileaks-cables-bulgarian-nuclear-project","sectionName":"US news"},{"webTitle":"Global wages: the global recession brought home","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-16T11:23:07Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2010/dec/15/data-store-recession","fields":{"body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/press-and-media-centre/press-releases/WCMS_149929/lang--en/index.htm\">global wage report</a> for 2010/11 was published last night. </p><p>This survey really brings home effects of the dramatic changes in the world economy. The global economic downturn is often bafflingly abstract until the effects are felt in everyday life, like in the pay packets of people all over the world.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm\">International Labour Office</a> (ILO) has the job of collating a representative sample of wages from 177 countries. This is no mean feat. </p><p>In some cases countries have their own national statistics on wages, such as in the UK we have the Office for National Statistics who produce the <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=1951\">The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings</a>. </p><p>There were 115 countries who could provide data on their national wages, but even then the ILO have to reconcile different methods of gathering wage data within the same country. Then it is necessary to make sure historic wages are adjusted for consumer price inflation, fortunately the International Monetary Fund have <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/scr1_sp.cfm?s_year=2010&amp;e_year=2010&amp;brtype=default\">consumer price inflation</a> for each country. </p><p>The worst problem to cope with is when the global wages are only very sporadically available, in these cases the ILO performed regression that is  explained fully in the Technical appendix 1 of the report. </p><p>The definition of 'wage' is payment by an employer in return for work, this  excludes self-employed workers. Even with this assumption the ILO claim that the wage data they collate covers 94 per cent of the world's wage earners and approximately 98.5 per cent of the global wage bill. </p><p>Using all this data the global wage report presents monthly average wages for all employees for each country, and using the projected and actual wage data the ILO calculate a global index of wages. </p><p>Given all these methods and data, there remains one very important question about the report: what does it show about global wages?</p><p>The growth in real average monthly wages declined from 2.8 per cent before the crisis in 2007 to 1.5 per cent in 2008 and 1.6 per cent in 2009. </p><p>Altogether, the level of real wages fell in 12 of the 28 advanced countries in 2008 and in seven of the advanced countries in 2009.</p><p>Here is a breakdown of average wages per country with a comparison of wages in 2005 to 2009.

climate change conference: We must end energy apartheid | Drew Corbyn","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-10T09:30:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2010/dec/10/cancun-climate-change-conference-energy-access","fields":{"body":"<p>While the discussions on strategies to reduce global emissions rage on in Cancún, too many of the world's poorest people continue to live without adequate access to energy.</p><p>It's clear that for people living in poverty, energy access is absolutely essential for a better life.  The services provided by energy are needed in so many ways: cooking meals, lighting, refrigeration of food and medical supplies, and for earning a living - the list goes on.  And yet, too few leaders and decision-makers are concerned enough to act on the issue.</p><p>Using traditional forms of energy is a major burden - collecting firewood for cooking can take some women in Ethiopia three hours a day on average, and inhaling the smoke from cooking on open fires causes many health problems.  A staggering 1.4 million people die each year as a result of inhaling smoke from traditional stoves.</p><p>For people living in poverty, energy access is crucial, as the experiences of people like Rosa, a Turkana woman living in the Kakuma refugee camp in north western Kenya, make abundantly clear: \"For me, getting energy for cooking and lighting is a daily worry. It's so hard to find firewood that I cook for my family only once a day, in the evening. The fire provides the light for cooking and eating a meal with my children. After eating is bedtime.\"</p><p>The scale of the problem is truly daunting. Some 3 billion people still cook using traditional biomass (such as wood, charcoal and dung) and 1.5 billion have no access to electricity.  Recent progress on increasing the number of people with access to electricity has been commendable, but a disconnect remains between gaining electricity and realising development benefits, such as increased income and better health. Progress on reducing the number of people cooking with dirty fuels has been abysmal. At the current rate there will still be 3 billion people cooking with dirty fuels and 1.4 million people dying from indoor air pollution in 20 years time.</p><p>The millennium development goals (MDGs) remain all but out of reach in the period up to 2015. Energy access arrived as a hot topic too late for the MDGs, but it has since been recognised as vital in terms of achieving the goals.</p><p>Looking past the current MDGs, it's important we have something to focus efforts on, and energy should be recognised in this. To this end the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, launched the target of universal energy access by 2030. This is a laudable goal and one that all governments should rally behind. Broad engagement from the development community and national governments should work to refine the goal and set intermediary targets.</p><p>Some find the link between energy access and climate change a source of tension, arguing that it is foolhardy, given that the world is hurtling towards dangerously high levels of carbon in the atmosphere, to encourage nearly half the world's population to use more energy.  This position is short-sighted and unjust.  Meeting the basic energy needs of all the world's people would contribute less than 2% to current global emissions. People living in poverty should not be deprived of the opportunity to improve their lives because of the developed world's historical profligacy.</p><p>For others, climate change mitigation funding represents a golden opportunity to get cash for energy access projects. This apparent win-win is rarely realised.  To date, mitigation funds have mainly benefitted middle-income countries, rather than the poorest and most vulnerable who are in desperate need of energy services.</p><p><a href=\"http://practicalaction.org/\" title=\"Practical Action\">Practical Action</a> has just published the <a href=\"http://www.practicalaction.org/energy-advocacy/ppeo-report-poor-peoples-energy-outlook?utm_campaign=PPEO-2010\" title=\"Poor People's Energy Outlook\">Poor People's Energy Outlook</a>, a report calling for the end of '\"energy apartheid\" in developing countries and the establishment of a globally agreed set of minimum standards for energy access.</p><p>What emerges from the research is how critical the relationship is between people and energy - how it can hold people back and how it can transform lives. Mamdhur is a farmer from an indigenous group who lives with his family in the foothills of the Nepal Himalaya. He explains how improved lighting changed his life: \"Now we have electric lighting, we are very much relieved. We have more time to spend with our children and families, and no longer breathe in the smoke from the kerosene lamp that used to hurt our lungs. It was my dream to have lighting facilities in my village. The dark has turned to light.\" Access to modern energy can truly transform the lives of people living in poverty.</p><p>We need a concerted and coherent approach to achieve universal energy access.  The gravity of the issue needs to be met with financial support from donors, national governments and the private sector.  Policies at international and national level should encourage a delivery ecosystem that's fit for purpose, and practitioners need to focus on the impacts that can be realised with modern energy.</p><p>The target of universal energy access by 2030 is attainable.  The climate change blinkers need to be removed from the energy debate with greater recognition of energy access for poverty reduction. We have the technology and are all too familiar with the barriers.  Champions are needed to drive the energy access agenda.</p><p>Energy apartheid is deeply unjust. It can, and must, be addressed.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2010/12/9/1291907391801/MDG--Energy-Access--women-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/dec/10/cancun-climate-change-conference-energy-access","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/dec/10/cancun-climate-change-conference-energy-access","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Cancún climate change summit: The final day as it happened","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-10T09:00:00Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/blog/2010/dec/10/cancun-climate-change-summit-final","fields":{"body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p>.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>09.00am:</strong> Two weeks of wrangling over the fate of the world come to a climax today at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/oct/08/cancun-cop16-climate-talks\">the UN climate summit in Cancún, Mexico</a>.</p><p>At stake is not just whether billions of people will have \"shrinking horizons and smaller futures\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/08/ban-ki-moon-cancun-climate-deal\">as Ban Ki-moon puts it</a>, but the credibility of the <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/2860.php\">UN body</a> overseeing the talks. </p><p>Unlike <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/copenhagen\">Copenhagen last year</a>, no one is expecting a binding deal at Cancún that will commit countries to cut the carbon emissions responsible for climate change. That much <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/01/climate-change-deal-impossible-2010\">has been clear since as early as February</a>, and since then everyone from the UN to key countries and NGOs has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/sep/03/mexico-foreign-minister-cancun-talks\">been conducting expectation management</a>.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-369688599'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2010/12/9/1291892983016/Cancun-COP16-UK-Climate-S-001.jpg' alt='Cancun COP16: UK Climate Secretary Chris Huhne helping to facilitate information consultations' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Chris Huhne</figcaption></figure><p>But the talks could still produce modest successes on forest protection, the speed and amount of financial aid developed countries give to developing ones to adapt to climate impacts, the transfer of clean technology, and monitoring of countries' efforts to cut greenhouse gases. Or it could end in a procrastinating failure, with key decisions deferred another year, until <a href=\"http://www.cop17durban.com/COP_17/Pages/default.aspx\">Durban in South Africa</a>. Such failure, the energy and climate secretary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/09/cancun-climate-change-car-crash\">Chris Huhne warned yesterday</a>, could result in a vicious downward spiral as countries send increasingly more junior representatives each year: </p><blockquote><p>Next year people will say, well, we're not going to make any progress, and we end up with a zombie conference where there won't be anybody at a senior enough level to take any serious decisions at all</p></blockquote><p>So far, the talks in Cancún have followed a familiar narrative for UN climate talks. Poorer countries <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/04/cancun-climate-talks-kyoto-latin-america\">have threatened to walk out over uncompromising negotiating stances taken by rich ones</a>, the Kyoto protocol – the legally binding treaty that compels developed countries to cut emissions by 2012 – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/09/cancun-climate-change-car-crash\">has been at heart of disagreements</a>, and leaked texts have revealed backroom deals (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/09/cancun-climate-summit-alternative-deal\">this time the EU and small island states</a> – last year's was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/08/copenhagen-climate-summit-disarray-danish-text\">the controversial 'Danish text'</a>). Plus this year we've had the added spice of cables released by WikiLeaks that show <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-us-manipulated-climate-accord\">how the US used its diplomatic muscle</a> to get support for the weak <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/21/copenhagen-accord-climate-change\">Copenhagen accord document</a> that emerged this time last year.</p><p>Officially, we should hear the outcome of Cancún at midnight (the summit is six hours behind UK time). But judging from the final day at Copenhagen last year, when Barack Obama delayed his flight home for last-minute negotiations, it's likely to go on until the early hours. This live blog will try to keep going until the end result - Damian Carrington will be taking over from me this afternoon.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>9.16am:</strong> India's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, has said India may eventually commit to legally binding cuts in emissions. Here's Ramesh, according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN-IBN\">an Indian TV news broadcast</a> this morning that <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/comments/idINIndia-53474720101210\">Reuters is reporting</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><figure data-media-id='gu-image-369688600'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/12/7/1291688087213/Jairam-Ramesh-India-envir-001.jpg' alt='Jairam Ramesh, India environment minister' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jairam Ramesh, India's environment minister</figcaption></figure><p>All countries must make binding commitments in appropriate legal form. This does not mean that India is for a legally binding commitment at this stage. That's our position. There are changing realities that we have to understand. Increasingly, more and more developing countries are asking questions of India, China and the United States, the three big countries saying they will not accept an international legally-binding agreement. I have nuanced our position ... Let's keep this discussion going, let's understand the sentiments of the rest of the world, and let's not be painted as the bad guy.</p></blockquote><p>However tentative the remarks, they're a relatively big deal for India.

Whether the guilt lies with those in the tourist class or those sitting up front in first class and the plane continues to go down. It's as if we were in a truck on a winding road and the driver has had a heart attack, and we're all on the edge of hitting a tree, going over into a ravine, squabbling again.

It's by Drew Corbyn, from the charity <a href=\"http://practicalaction.org/\">Practical Action</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Some find the link between energy access and climate change a source of tension, arguing that it is foolhardy, given that the world is hurtling towards dangerously high levels of carbon in the atmosphere, to encourage nearly half the world's population to use more energy. This position is short-sighted and unjust. Meeting the basic energy needs of all the world's people would contribute less than 2% to current global emissions.

It centres on <a href=\"http://geotest.tamu.edu/userfiles/216/dessler10b.pdf\">a paper by Dr Andrew Dessler at Texas A&amp;M University</a> from Science today. It is about whether, on average, clouds increase or decrease warming.</p><p>The paper has been attacked by <a href=\"http://www.drroyspencer.com/\">Dr Roy Spencer</a>, a scientist who is sceptical about anthropogenic global warming (and also happens to be a <a href=\"http://www.ideasinactiontv.com/tcs_daily/2005/08/faith-based-evolution.html\">proponent of intelligent design</a>).</p><p>The two have an interesting but technical disagreement that sometime when it is not so late I'd like to think about more carefully. But leaving aside the content of the science for now, <a href=\"http://www.drroyspencer.com/\">Spencer makes one outrageous<br />claim</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Dessler's paper is being announced on probably THE best day for it to support the IPCC's COP-16 meeting here in Cancun, and whatever agreement is announced tomorrow in the way of international climate policy. I suspect – but have no proof of it – that Dessler was under pressure to get this paper published to blunt the negative impact our work has had on the IPCC's efforts.</p></blockquote><p>He seems to be suggesting that Dessler decided the publication timing for political ends. As any scientist will tell you, it is hard enough getting journals to publish in the year of their choosing, let alone on a particular <em>day</em>.</p><p>Dessler has responded to the critique of the science and the conspiracy charge <a href=\"http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/12/feedback-on-cloud-feedback/\">on RealClimate</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I can assure everyone that no one pressured me in any aspect of the publication of this paper.

The World Bank is a trustee.</p><p>On cutting emissions, the numbers that countries pledged in the Copehagen Accord now go into the final text (though they are way short of keeping temperature rise to 2C).

The guilty one is not the publisher, it is the person who wrote [these things]. Blame the person who wrote this nonsense because there would be no scandal if they hadn't.\" Many leaks relate to the security situation in Rio de Janeiro. A 2009 cable warned that pre-Olympic attempts to expel drug traffickers from some of the city's most violent favelas could resemble \"the battles in Fallujah more than a conventional urban police operation\".</p><p><strong>Argentina</strong></p><p>In Argentina the Wikileaks revelations have focused on apparent US concern about a new invasion of the Falklands islands and over president Cristina Kirchner mental health.  In one cable Hillary Clintonmused over whether the current occupant of the Casa Rosada was \"taking any medications.\"</p><p>\"How do Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's emotions affect her decision-making and how does she calm down when distressed?\" one cable asked diplomats in the Argentine capital.</p><p>The English-language Buenos Aires Herald, however, pointed out that \"the snickering about the President's mental health comes at a time [when] she is perceived by much of the public, including those who oppose her, as having shown tremendous strength immediately after her husband's death.\"</p><p><strong>Venezuela</strong></p><p>Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, has called on Hillary Clinton to resign in the wake of \"all of this spying and delinquency in the State Department\".</p><p>\"Look at how they treat the leaders of powerful countries,\" Chavez told state TV channel Telesur, describing the cables as proof of the \"dirty war of Yankee embassies in the whole world\".</p><p>\"Look how they are mistreating this great friend of ours, Vladimir Putin. What a lack of respect!\"</p><p><strong>Ecuador and Bolivia</strong></p><p>The Ecuadorian government has been Wikileaks' most vocal supporter in the region, offering the under-fire Julian Assange residency \"without any conditions\". Bolivia has also expressed its irritation at its portrayal in the US diplomatic cables. The country's vice-president, Alvaro Garcia Linera, this week posted Bolivia-focused Wikileaks cables, in full, on his official website in response to what he called \"insults\" and \"third rate espionage\".</p><p>US authorities have been lampooned by much of the Bolivian press.</p><p>Juan José Toro Montoya, a columnist for the Cochabamba newspaper Los Tiempos newspaper described the accusations against Wikileaks' founder as \"laughable\".</p><p>\"Julian Assange may be under arrest but he has been transformed into a hero and will go down in history as being the first human being to massively reveal the dirty-tricks of government,\" he wrote yesterday.</p><h2>Middle East</h2><p><strong>Iran</strong></p><p>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismissed the Wikileaks revelations as \"psychological warfare.\" Iran's foreign ministry spokesman thundered: \"The enemies of the Islamic world are pursuing a project of Iranophobia and disunity. This project only protects the interests of the Zionist regime and its supporters.\" Still, the documents will reinforce the regime's world view by underlining the huge effort being made by the US to contain Iran by applying pressure for UN sanctions over its nuclear programme or stopping arms deliveries to groups like Hamas and Hizbullah. It will be harder to maintain the pretence of good relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states because of exposure of their fear of Tehran. Iran remains defiant and is not as isolated as Washington would like. It is influential in Iraq and has good relations with Turkey. It is clear that Barack Obama's efforts to reach out to it have failed, with some arguing he was never serious about engagement. The status quo looks volatile and threatening.</p><p><strong>Israel</strong></p><p>Israel has been largely untroubled by because US views on key Middle Eastern issues especially on Iran, Syria and Lebanon, are so close to its own. \"Israel is not the centre of international attention,\" said Binyamin Netanyahu. \"Normally, there's a gap between what is said publicly and what is said privately, but in this case, the gap is not large.\" The most significant revelation was that Israel believes that beyond a certain point attacking Iran would cause too much \"collateral damage.\"Israel can be seen maintaining discreet contact with Gulf states and have an intriguing intelligence link to Saudi Arabia. It suits Israel that the Palestinian issue and Jewish settlements in the occupied territories do not feature prominently. The Palestinian Authority denied suggestions it acquiesced in Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.</p><p><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></p><p>Saudi Arabia's only public comment on the revelations was to say \"they do not concern us\" despite the sensational exposure of comments made by King Abdullah about attacking Iran \"to cut off the head of the snake.\" It will be unhappy about US complaints that it remains a source of funding for the Taliban and other extremists. It may be pleased its counter-terrorist efforts against al-Qaida, at home and in neighbouring Yemen, have been given positive exposure. There is little evidence of US pressure over human rights and democracy.</p><p><strong>Lebanon</strong></p><p>Ever volatile Lebanon has been shaken by documents showing close links between the pro-western government and the US. The most damaging revelation described its defence minister offering advice on how Israel could defeat Hezbollah if a new war erupted. But Elias Murr complained that the cables were \"inaccurate\" and taken out of context. Tensions are already high because of expectations Hizbullah members will be indicted for the 2005 murder of Rafiq al-Hariri. Al-Akhbar, a leftist and pro-Hizbullah paper that has published leaks of the leaks about the Arab world, has come under cyber attack.</p><p><strong>Syria</strong></p><p>Syria has not responded officially to disclosures that it is the subject of intense US efforts to stop deliveries of weapons to Hezbollah. Syrians say they are struck by the absence of embarrassing information about Israel. Sami Moubayed, an influential commentator, wrote: \"Perhaps WikiLeaks will one day tell us, for example, what the Israelis are hiding about the pre-Bush era.\" Damascus insists it only supports resistance to Israel and blames it for ramping up regional tensions. Ample evidence of American strategy to weaken the alliance between Damascus and Tehran, but there is no sign that it has worked.</p><p><strong>Yemen</strong></p><p>Yemen's government has faced embarrassing questions in parliament about evidence ministers lied about US air strikes against al-Qaida targets. Cables revealed President Ali Abdullah Saleh is worried about being painted as an American pawn and restricts counter-terrorist cooperation even as Washington presses for more determined action. Opposition MP Mansur al Zindani complained of a \"powerful blow to parliament and the public.\" There are fears the revelations could help al-Qaida win new recruits in the Arab world's poorest country.</p><p><strong>Libya</strong></p><p>Muammar Gaddafi praised WikiLeaks for exposing US \"hypocrisy.\" The whistleblowing website has \"proved America is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be.\" There was no comment on threats against Britain if the Lockerbie bomber, Abdel-Basset al-Megrahi, died in prison in Scotland.</p><p><strong>Egypt</strong></p><p>Revelations about Egypt – some leaked to the independent newspaper al-Masry al-Youm — have been dismissed by Cairo as containing \"nothing new.\" But they include evidence of its fears about Sudan breaking up, President Mubarak's profound hostility to Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah, and bleak US assessments of future prospects for democracy, including the prediction that Mubarak, now 82, will stand for yet another term next year. The recent parliamentary elections, widely dismissed as a charade, tend to confirm US views.</p><p><strong>Tunisia</strong></p><p>President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali will be furious at cables describing high-level corruption, a sclerotic regime, and deep hatred of his wife and her family. Deeply unflattering reports from the US ambassador in Tunis make no bones about the state of the small Maghreb country, widely considered one of the most repressive in North Africa. No surprise that Tunisia blocked the website of Beirut's al-Akhbar, which published some of the documents.</p><p><strong>Turkey</strong></p><p>Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan reacted furiously to US diplomatic cables that suggested he was a corrupt closet Islamist. As Turkey heads for elections next year, secular Republican opponents may try to exploit his evident discomfort.</p><p>The cables highlighted three principal issues. Erdogan's personal probity – he was reported to have eight secret Swiss bank accounts; the supposed Islamist agenda of the ruling AKP party; and Turkey's perceived drift away from the western alliance and closer embrace of countries such as Syria and Iran.</p><p>Erdogan's response was both to dismiss the cables as tittle-tattle, and to conjure conspiracy theories.\"The un-serious cables of American diplomats, formed from gossip, magazines, allegations and slander are spreading worldwide via the internet,\" Erdogan said. \"Are there disclosures of state secrets, or is there another aim?\" he askedd. \"… Is it carrying out a veiled, dark propaganda? Are there efforts to affect, manipulate relations between certain countries?\"</p><h2>Europe</h2><p><strong>Russia</strong></p><p>Prime Minister Vladimir Putin gave the sharpest response to the WikiLeaks cables in which he was protrayed as  Batman to Dmitry Medvedev's Robin. \"Slander\", he called it. The embassy cables portray Russia as a corrupt kleptocracy where politicians and criminals were inextricably linked. Medvedev has said that the cables \"show a full measure of cynicism\" in US foreign policy making. But he suggested the leaks would not damage relations between Moscow and WashingtonSergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, claimed to be surprised that \"some petty thieves running around the Internet\" are causing such a sensation. In reality, the cables have caused lasting damage in Russia, playing to the deep mistrust of US intentions that imbues Kremlin policy making.</p><p><strong>Poland</strong></p><p>The cables revealed a battle of wits and mutual dissembling between Warsaw and Washington over US military aid to Poland, missile defence, and attitudes towards Russia. While the Poles welcomed secret Nato plans for the defence of the three Baltic states, they worried the new plan would dilute Nato security guarantees for Poland.</p><p>The disclosures appear to be sparking a sober re-assessment in Warsaw of the closeness of the relationship with Washington.</p><p>Prime Minister Donald Tusk sounded bitter and disenchanted on Tuesday after the Guardian published material on Poland.</p><p>\"We have a really serious problem,\" he said. \"Not with image, as some countries do, and not reputation, like the US does. It's a problem of being stripped of illusions about the nature of relations between countries, including such close allies as Poland and the US.\"</p><p><strong>Italy</strong></p><p>La Repubblica, one of Italy's best-selling dailies, on Wednesday carried the first in a series of articles examining the relationship between Silvio Berlusconi and Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, in the light of claims reported by the US state department cables that the Italian leader was profiting from gas deals between their two countries.</p><p>Newspapers and other media have given extensive coverage to the WikiLeaks disclosures. Berlusconi, who has denied any financial interest in Italy's energy dealings, was also embarrassed by a cable that quoted him as referring to Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev as an \"apprentice\". He insisted he never said it.</p><p>But in a country where the prime minister cannot be forced to answer to parliament and where attention is now focussed mainly on two parliamentary censure motions that could topple the Berlusconi administration next week, the political fall-out has been limited. Pierluigi Bersani, the leader of Italy's biggest opposition group, the Democratic party, said the cables showed that \"the prime minister, with his behaviour and political decisions, harms the reputation of Italy in the world.\"</p><p>But, for the most part, opposition politicians have heeded a warning from Berlusconi's foreign minister, Franco Frattini, not to exploit the cables for political purposes.</p><p><strong>Austria </strong></p><p>The cables show a rather withering US contempt for Austria and its leading politicians, with US diplomats complaining that Washington has little leverage in Vienna because the government there is barely interested in developing relations with the US. The social democratic chancellor, Werner Faymann, is described as a leader with scant interest in foreign affairs. The foreign minister, Michael Spindelegger, is preoccupied with promoting Austrian business. And Austria, constitutionally neutral and not in Nato, is criticised for resisting US pressure to send forces to Afghanistan.</p><p>Norbert Darabos, the defence minister, described the US criticism as \"inexplicable\", and said Austria would not increase its contribution to Afghanistan beyond the five policemen it has sent.</p><p>A leading Austrian Greens MP, Peter Pilz, proposed that the country should grant Julian Assange political asylum.</p><p><strong>Kazakhstan</strong></p><p>US cables described the peccadilloes of the Kazakh elite, including the 40-horse stable of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president, a private Elton John concert for a top politician and an extraordinary midnight dance by the prime minister at a nightclub called Chocolat. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, was at pains to privately apologise to several world leaders who were pilloried in the disclosures.</p><p><strong>Turkmenistan</strong></p><p>In perhaps the baldest character assassination of any world leader in the WikiLeaks cables, a US diplomat reported to Washington that president Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov of Turkmenistan is seen as \"vain, fastidious, vindictive, a micro-manager,\" a \"practised liar\" and \"not a very bright guy\". In keeping with the country's insular regime, the charge provoked little reaction.</p><p><strong>Georgia</strong></p><p>Disclosures about the Caucasus state were a mixed bag. As the New York Times noted, they showed US diplomats' catastrophic failure to recognise that Mikhail Saakashvili, the president, was planning to attack the breakaway enclave of South Ossetia in 2008. But they also concluded that before the conflict Russia had been \"aggressively playing a high-stakes covert game\" in an attempt to provoke Georgia into retaliation. Giga Bokeria, secretary of Georgia's national security council, toed Washington's line in his assessment of the WikiLeaks releases. \"It is very cynical when one, under the guise of a martyr, fights against the greatest democracy [the US] using such prohibited methods,\" he said of Julian Assange, in televised comments.</p><p><strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong></p><p>Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital, was the setting for Prince Andrew's infamous rant about geographically-challenged Americans and snooping \"(expletive) journalists, especially from the National Guardian.\" At a meeting with the prince, Tatiana Gfoeller, the US ambassador to Bishkek, decided he was a victim of \"neuralgic patriotism\" whose behaviour \"verged on the rude\". Kyrgyzstan's leadership has been silent on that sharp assessment, while local media have been more interested in claims that China offered the country a $3bn (£1.9bn) aid package if it would close the Manas airbase, which the US uses to supply its troops in Afghanistan.</p><p><strong>Moldova</strong></p><p>According to the WikiLeaks documents, Moldova's then president, Vladimir Voronin, offered a $10m (£6.4m) bribe to a rival in 2009 in a desperate attempt to keep his communist government in power. A leading member of Voronin's party, Mark Tkachuk, told reporters the claims were \"fairy tales\" and \"low-life gossip\".</p><h2>Africa</h2><p><strong>Kenya</strong></p><p>It took just a few leaked words to create an outcry from the Kenyan government. In a teaser of what the cables from Nairobi would reveal, Der Spiegel said last week that US officials believed the country was a \"swamp of corruption\" — hardly a heretic view on the streets of Nairobi. Government spokesman <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczFyQZqhes&amp;feature=player_embedded#at=91\" title=\"\">Alfred Mutua immediately called a news conference</a> to say the government was \"surprised and shocked\".</p><p>\"If what is reported is true, it is totally malicious, and a total misrepresentation of our country and our leaders,\" he said.</p><p>He went on to say that foreign countries funding youth empowerment schemes in Kenya – a barely veiled reference to the US — were in fact trying to overthrow the government. The US ambassador to Nairobi, Michael Ranneberger, described Mutua's claims as \"utterly ridiculous\". The prime minister told parliament he welcomed the Wikileaks revelations.</p><p>'We now know what some of our friends think about us … it is helpful.\"</p><p>After the revelations on Thursday that the US ambassador believed rampant corruption could lead in renewed violence in the country, Kibaki's office released a statement defending his record.</p><p>\"We wish to state that President Kibaki's record on reforms through out his career speaks for itself. ,\" it said.</p><p><strong>Uganda</strong></p><p>The authorities in Uganda were also riled. In response to claims that President Yoweri Museveni feared his plane being shot down on the orders of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, the Ugandan foreign minister Sam Kutesa issued a statement yesterday (Thursday).</p><p>\"While it is true that we hold discussions with the US government on regional and internationals issues, the contents of the alleged cables are grossly inaccurate and illogical. For example, if the Ugandan president perceived the threat to fly the international airspace, the solution would be for him to stay at home. Other leaders in the world have done so in the past.\"</p><p>But Museveni's spokesman Tamale Mirundi confirmed that other leaked cables referring to the president's concern about Sudan supporting the Lord's Resistance Army rebels a few years ago, and Eritrea being a regional threat, were in fact accurate.</p><p><strong>Eritrea</strong></p><p>Despite its president being described by US officials as an \"unhinged dictator\", there was no reaction from Eritrea to the leaked cables. There is also no free press in Eritrea.</p><p><strong>Nigeria</strong></p><p>Royal Dutch Shell said it was \"absolutely untrue\" that it had infiltrated every Nigerian ministry affecting its operations there. The company offered no further comment.</p><p><strong>Zimbabwe</strong></p><p>In an opinion piece in the state-run Herald newspaper, Reason Wafawarova focused on how the cables showed that Mugabe had defied US expectations of his demise from power. He also delighted in description of opposition leader and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai as a \"flawed figure\".</p><h2>South Asia</h2><p><strong>Pakistan</strong></p><p>The rich store of WikiLeaks revelations about Pakistan have monopolized headlines and the political agenda for over ten days. But some stories are considered too hot to touch. While cables exposing the foibles of Pakistan's civilian leaders triggered a media feeding frenzy, the press largely ignored revelations that cast the powerful military in a bad light, including its alleged support for Islamist extremist groups such as the Taliban. That left politicians struggling to bat off embarrassing allegations, such as the bearded religious firebrand seen cosying up to the American ambassador, President Asif Zardari's obsession with his death, or prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani's secret support for CIA drone strikes.</p><p>\"Don't trust WikiLeaks,\" Gilani told reporters in Kabul at the weekend, attempting to brush off the revelations as \"the observations of junior diplomats\". Beside him President Hamid Karzai, also tarred in the dispatches, nodded solemnly. Rarely have the sparring neighbours agreed so easily. Coverage of army chief General Ashfaq Kayani focused on revelations that he threatened to oust Zardari last year but held back because he \"distrusted\" opposition contender Nawaz Sharif. The army issued a statement that Kayani \"holds all political leaders in esteem\". But most reporters shied away from US intelligence assessments that the army under Kayani continues to support the Taliban and Mumbai attackers Lashkar-e-Taiba. \"ISI extols the virtues of some Taliban elements\" read one small headline that provided no other details; otherwise loquacious television anchors were largely silent on the matter. One exception was the new Express Tribune paper. \"It has always been an open secret that the military acts as puppet master,\"&nbsp;said an editorial \"Only now do we have confirmation of just how tenuous the hold of democracy in the country really is.\"</p><p>Pakistani conspiracy theorists insisted the cables had been deliberately leaked as part of a Washington plot to discredit the Muslim world; the Saudi ambassador described them as \"a rapist's propaganda\".</p><p>But for most Pakistanis, the cables simply confirmed how much influence the US wields&nbsp;over their military and civilian leaders. Several headlines referred to the \"WikiLeaks shame\"; former diplomat Asif Ezdi said they proved Pakistan had become \"the world's biggest banana republic\".</p><p>The judiciary, meanwhile, liked the cables. Dismissing an attempt to block their publication, High Court judge Sheikh Azmat Saeed, said that WikiLeaks \"may cause trouble for some personalities\" but would be \"good for the progress of the nation in the long run.\"</p><p><strong>Afghanistan</strong></p><p>In Afghanistan the Wikileaks disclosure have been a source of endless fascination for the general public, with the country's journalists devoting hours of airtime to pouring over the cables. Among pundits debate has raged about the meaning of the revelations, and even whether they can be believed with some incredulous commentators refusing to accept that the world's most powerful country could ever lose so much confidential information. Some have even suggested it was a put up job by the Americans themselves.</p><p>But so far there have been no major political casualties, despite the deeply critical remarks of Hamid Karzai made by his own senior ministers and the US ambassador.</p><p>The Afghan president has publicly thrown his support behind Omar Zakhiwal, his finance minister who was quoted in cables describing his boss as \"extremely weak man\". But a cabinet reshuffle is expected after the new parliament is inaugurated.</p><p>Also thought to be vulnerable is Karl Eikenberry, the US ambassador who wrote at times despairing notes back to Washington about Karzai.</p><p>The Afghan and US governments have insisted their relationship remains strong but former US ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad has publicly said Eikenberry's position is untenable.</p><p>Many believe there is now no chance that he will extend his soon to expire two year term, if he wanted to.</p><p><strong>India</strong></p><p>In India the reaction to WikiLeaks was initially muted or positive, though the revelations were covered by all sectors of the press, including the local language media. \"The first lot of WikiLeaks documents paints a flattering picture of India as a reliable, trusted and respected power in a world that worries itself sick about neighbouring Pakistan,\" the Times of India newspaper said. Coverage focused on revelations from Pakistan and particularly about Islamabad's security services' relationship with local Islamic extremists. India's external affairs ministry refused to comment on the leak other than to stress its continuing \"candid\" dialogue with the United States. As the week has passed criticism, both of Western countries and of the leak, has built up, particularly as police in the UK moved to arrest the Wikileaks founder. \"The way these governments have been going after Assange and his group raises the question whether what is commonly called the free world is really free,\" said the Mumbai-based newspaper Daily News Analysis. Others attacked those behind the leak. \"There is a strong feeling that the sense of responsibility lacks,\" union law minister Veerappa Moily told The Guardian yesterday (Wednesday). \"This just creates mutual misunderstanding. The trust is endangered by such leaks and that is a very unhealthy trend.\" Shashi Tharoor, former minister of state for external affairs, called the leaks \"unethical and wrong\".</p><p>\"The confidentiality of government communications is the lifeblood of diplomatic comfort,\" Tharoor told a local reporter. \"You do not effectively run a government if your own diplomats cannot report to their own capitals in utter candour.\" Other commentators however called for an Indian version of the leak, arguing that the Indian bureaucracy was one of the most opaque in the world and could only benefit from public scrutiny. ends</p><p><strong>Bangladesh</strong></p><p>Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have been on the front page of most newspapers in Bangladesh over the last week. The story has been of particular interest to the country's many students who thronged street tea stalls in Dhaka, the capital, to discuss \"how WikiLeaks has shaken the US administration by revealing its confidential cables\", according to one local journalist. Anis Pervez, an associate professor at the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh, said he had discussed the leaks in his classroom lecture on media ethics. \"Every state has sovereignty and sometimes some information can create tension. Then again, there is a dilemma over how much information one should reveal to the public just because he or she has it,\" he said. One particularly cable alleging that the Islamic extremist group Lashkar-e-Toiba had established sleeper cells in Bangladesh hit headlines. \"The information divulged on the WikiLeaks is creating an odd situation for many countries. We have not yet checked the documents found regarding Bangladesh,\" said Yafeash Osman, state minister for science and technology, said.</p><p><strong>Nepal</strong></p><p>In Nepal there has therefore been some disappointment that most of the 2,600 documents that were sent from the US Embassy in Kathmandu have not yet to be released. The leaks sparked frantic efforts by Nepali politicians as well as journalists to find out what revelations about the Himalayan nation could be expected with journalists offices in Kathmandu bombarded by calls from politicians and leaderships seeking tips on what might be coming. As elsewhere released cables have been scoured for elements of local interest. Documents suggesting that Maoist rebels had received Indian funding provoked an inevitably strongly worded reaction from Nepal's Maoist party. Other cables touching on the relations between regional giants China and India have also been minutely scrutinised.</p><p><strong>Sri Lanka</strong></p><p>In Sri Lanka, the leaks provoked a political and media storm as many focused on the island nation's controversial and bloody recent history. While one effectively accused President Mahinda Rajapaksa of being complicit in war crimes – a charge he denies – another described a diplomatic campaign by British former foreign secretary David Miliband to champion aid and human rights during the Sri Lankan humanitarian crisis last year as largely driven by domestic political calculations. Media reactions have varied. Newspapers loyal to the government have covered the various allegations made in the cables but have particularly focused on material that is embarrassing to the US or the UK The campaigning Sunday Leader however published a call to journalistic arms: \"As media acquired books, the powerful enacted bans. As media developed newspapers, the powerful found ways to seal them in courts or seduce them with access and wealth. Through all this one force, however, is constant. You can't keep a good story down. You can't stop the thirst for justice, you can only mask it for a while. This is a lesson that WikiLeaks is teaching the world, and we hope that it will reach Sri Lankan ears.\"</p><h2>Asia Pacific</h2><p><strong>China</strong></p><p>China has been tight-lipped. It has also been increasingly keen to stop others from having their say, deleting articles and discussions about the cables. It called the contents of the diplomatic memos \"absurd\" but has otherwise refused to comment on the information they contain, such as reports of official frustration with North Korea and a source's claim that a senior official was behind the attack on Google.</p><p>Foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said yesterday that Beijing hoped the emergence of the cables would not affect relations with Washington.</p><p>Censorship has not stopped some people from reading about the cables on overseas websites.</p><p>\"Reading [about] China and Google, I want to say: WikiLeaks rocks!\" one wrote on a microblog service of the popular portal Sina earlier this week.</p><p>Another argued: \"What Wikileaks says about China must be a slander from the US. What do you think? The US government hates Wikileaks too? It must be a conspiracy.\"</p><p>China Digital Times, which monitors censorship, believes the <a href=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2010/12/latest-directives-from-the-ministry-of-truth-november-29-december-6-2010\" title=\"\">Central Propaganda Bureau issued an order</a> telling websites not to issue further reports on the cables, although some have reported on Julian Assange's arrest.</p><p><strong>Australia</strong></p><p>The role of Assange, the country's prodigal son, has generated the most coverage and debate. Referring to him as the 'Ned Kelly of the digital age', Bryce Lowry said: \"Assange is a cyber bushranger: a renegade taunter of authority and inspiration to many who marvel at his daring to challenge the status quo.\" Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the publication of the cables is illegal, and Assange's actions are \"grossly irresponsible\". She has made it clear the Australian government will offer him no support although the Australian consulate in the UK has offered him access to their services.</p><p>The cables themselves reveal an unflattering  view of former prime minister – now foreign minister –  Kevin Rudd. He was an abrasive, impulsive ''control freak'' who presided over a series of foreign policy blunders. Another cable referenced how Rudd angered the US by detailing a private conversation he had with Bush which included the moment he was \"stunned to hear Bush say, 'What's the G20?'\"</p><p>Rudd retaliated this week. \"Mr Assange is not himself responsible for the unauthorised release of 250,000 documents from the US diplomatic communications network. \"The Americans are responsible for that,\" he said.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/12/10/1291940034174/Pakistani-WikiLeaks-flag--002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/10/wikileaks-reaction-world-reaction","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/dec/10/wikileaks-reaction-world-reaction","sectionName":"US news"},{"webTitle":"Corruption index: global bribery and corruption worldwide ranked by Transparency International","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-09T11:30:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"news/datablog/2010/dec/09/global-corruption-index-worlwide-transparency-international","fields":{"body":"<p>If <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_12_07_media_advisory_gcb_2010\">Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer</a>, published today, is to be believed, global efforts to curb corruption are failing fairly dismally. The GCB differs from the more famous <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/oct/26/corruption-index-2010-transparency-international\">Corruption Perceptions Index</a> because it is a poll of ordinary citizens, not experts.</p><p>Asked if they thought corruption had got better or worse in the last three years, 91,000 working men and women around the world have given their emphatic response. 85% of Asians, 89% of Latin Americans, 76% of Africans, and a headline-worthy 97% of Europeans say that corruption has either stayed the same or got worse. So much for the world being on a trajectory towards the bright uplands of transparency and accountability. We appear to be moving backwards.</p><p>Those are the figures that stand out. But the fact is that corruption is not news. It is the backdrop to everyday life for much of the world.</p><p>What does it mean in real life? Well, a third of respondents under the age of 30 report paying a bribe in the past 12 months. In Sub-Saharan Africa that figure is far higher, with over a half of all respondents paying a bribe in the last 12 months. Payments to the police to get off a petty charge; payments to the hospital to get a decent bed for an ill relative; payments to the land registry to properly log a piece of land.</p><p>One in four people reported paying bribes in the last year and 29% said they had paid a bribe to the police. In Sub-Saharan Africa nearly half questioned had paid bribes to the police. In the EU the highest percentage of bribes was to Customs. The report also says political parties are the most corrupt of institutions around the world. In a scoring system ranging one to five, five meaning extremely corrupt, political parties scored 4.2 with parliament, legislature, police, public officials and civil servants following close behind. </p><p>The problem is not only that poor people are being made even poorer by a range of informal charges. The problem is that people with more money can pay bigger bribes. So you don't get that good bed after all; your child doesn't get into a decent school; your land is not registered but instead is sold off without your knowledge. Why? Because having the law on your side is not enough if you are poor and corruption is endemic.</p><p>So another year, another bribery report. Political parties are the sectors most liable to be corrupt. Still, just like in the 2007 and 2006 reports. The poor pay the most from petty bribery.</p><p>There is no obvious solution to corruption, any more than there is to theft, which is what it is. Rising living standards seem to be correlated to reduced petty corruption, with only 5% of respondents in the rich world paying bribes in the last year (note that grand corruption is a different matter). But, ultimately, human beings tend to act in ways they think they will get away with. Corruption's greatest friend is impunity. Only when law is enforced will corruption begin to ebb.</p><p>The key <a href=\"#data\">data</a> is below, with perception, bribery percentages and the institutions believed to be the most corrupt.

It won't make the Christmas Number One, but it is quite catchy, and it's nice about the Guardian.</p><p>Here's a sample of the lyrics:</p><p>If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear<br />Our friends are thin skinned, feckless and vain,<br />with a crazy old man and another just strange,<br />Don't corner Merkel, she'll become tenacious, <br />She's risk averse and rarely creative<br />Some are abysmal or taking their meds<br />While others won't keep their promises<br />Fet frequent flyer miles of Ban Ki Moon<br />His biometric data, we'll need it soon</p><p><strong></strong></p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>9.17am:</strong> When the WikiLeaks cables first started emerging, journalists from elsewhere, who hadn't been poring over them for months, were dismissive. They scoffed at them as \"tittle tattle\" and \"nothing new\".</p><p>At least one of them has repented. In <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/rachmanblog/2010/12/wikileaks-not-so-dull-after-all/\">FT blogpost Gideon Rachman writes</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In previous posts, <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/rachmanblog/2010/11/the-dullness-of-wikileaks/\">I dismissed WikiLeaks as not such a big deal</a>. Well, that was obviously wrong. I argued that everybody already knew that - for example - Nicolas Sarkozy is vain or Russia is a brutal and corrupt place, so the cables did not add much to the sum of human knowledge.</p><p>But that was wrong on two counts. First, there is a difference between an idea being conventional wisdom in the media, and spelled out in a diplomatic cable - both in terms of authority and in terms of political impact. You can see that in the angry reactions to the leaks from everybody from Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to Kevin Rudd, the foreign minister of Australia. (Apparently Rudd is a \"mistake-prone control freak\".) </p><p>Second, with the arrest of Julian Assange on dubious-sounding sexual assault charges - and now the attack on Mastercard's web-site, apparently by Assange supporters, the whole thing is shaping up into an unpredictable conflict between western governments and internet-based anarchists. And, as more and more material is released, there are some genuine surprises emerging.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>9.31am:</strong> <a href=\"http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1823/poll-wikileaks-harm-serve-public-interest-press-handling\">Six out of ten Americans think the release of the cables has been harmful to the public interest in the US</a>, according to Pew research.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-369609521'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/12/9/1291887513687/Pew.jpg' alt='wikileaks-pew-poll' width='220' height='260' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Those polled also said the cables had been more damaging that the release of the Afghanistan war logs.</p><blockquote><p>Six-in-ten (60%) of those paying attention to the story say they believe the release of thousands of secret State Department communications harms the public interest. About half that number (31%) say the release serves the public interest, according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted Dec. 2-5 among 1,003 adults.</p><p>Yet the public makes a distinction between WikiLeaks itself and the press' handling of the document release. While nearly four-in-ten (38%) of this group say news organizations have gone too far in reporting the confidential material, a comparable number (39%) say the media has struck the right balance. Just 14% say news organizations have held back too much of the classified material.</p></blockquote><p>Salon's Glenn Greenwald takes issue with the poll. He tweeted: </p><blockquote><p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/12618983144431616\">The premise of this Pew poll is false</a> -  that WL indiscriminately dumped 1,000s of docs while media selectively released</p></blockquote><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>9.54am:</strong> \"The campaign is not over...

For example, our terms of service state that \"you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content… that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity.\" It's clear that WikiLeaks doesn't own or otherwise control all the rights to this classified content.

In a statement, the national prosecutors' office said the youth – whose name was not released – is believed to have participated in attacks by WikiLeaks supporters on websites \"including MasterCard and Paypal, among others.\" Talk inside the internet backchannels, where many of these activists are discussing targets, immediately turned to the possibility of attacking the Dutch police's website, according to a source.

At present – and the vote has been live less than an hour – the crowd is split between Mastercard (44 votes out of 139) and the US senate (43 votes). Another attack on Visa is the least popular option. \"We can either hit a new target, or strike even more panic by re-attacking an easy target again that is easy to take down. Either way the media will spread the news,\" the group says. Amazon, it says, is not listed because there are \"not enough bots yet\". Presumably, that means the earlier splintering of the group – when it couldn't decide whether to bomb Amazon or Paypal – lost it some momentum.

(S/NF) Summary: China's engagement in Kenya continues to grow exponentially. China enjoys a large trade surplus with Kenya; exports increased by more than 25 percent a year from 2004 to 2008. The China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) is drilling for oil in the Isiolo region. China may be a potential partner in the development of the new mega-port at Lamu. In addition, China is heavily involved in various infrastructure projects across Kenya primarily with roads. China is also providing weapons to the GOK in support of its Somalia policies and increasing their involvement with the Kenyan National Security and Intelligence Service (NSIS) by providing telecommunications and computer equipment. Recently, China signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement with the GOK providing new development grants. To date, China and the U.S. do not collaborate on development projects in Kenya. End summary.</p><p>2. (U) China enjoys a large trade surplus with Kenya, exporting more than 30 times its imports. For 2008, China exported $917 million of goods to Kenya while China imported $29 million worth of Kenyan goods. China's exports in 2008 grew by 39 percent over 2007 capping the fourth straight year of at least 25 percent export growth, including a 54 percent increase in 2007 and a 79 percent increase in 2005. China is now the third largest exporter to Kenya after the United Arab Emirates, which principally exports oil to Kenya, and India. In comparison, the U.S. exported $440 million worth of goods to Kenya in 2008 while importing $343 million worth of Kenyan goods.</p><p>3. (U) The CNOOC is drilling for oil in the Isiolo region of Kenya (see ref A). The exploratory well will cost $26 million dollars and drilling will be complete in April 2010. Numerous oil companies have drilled 31 exploratory wells in Kenya over the last 50 years without success. However, CNOOC is making a credible effort to find oil in an area geologically similar to Southern Sudan, with its substantial oil finds. As reported ref A, we had heard that CNOOC would announce results from the exploratory well by January 2010; we are now hearing an announcement may come in April.</p><p>4. (U) The GOK is highly interested in developing a major port complex in Lamu, which has much greater potential as a deep water port than Mombasa. The GOK originally held discussions with Qatar over the development of the Lamu port in return for a substantial allocation of farm land. Negotiations involving development of the Lamu port reportedly occur inside the \"black box\" of President Kibaki's inner circle at State House. We understand, however, that talks with Qatar are off, and that the Chinese are in play as a potential partner for the port development project and associated regional infrastructure (road and rail infrastructure to Southern Sudan and Ethiopia, and pipeline infrastructure to Southern Sudan and Uganda). China's interest in the Lamu project is reportedly linked to the presence of oil in Southern Sudan and Uganda which could be exported via Lamu as well as the greater export potential to Ethiopia, Southern Sudan and Uganda. The addition of oil from Isiolo would add additional impetus to China's interest in the port development which is estimated to cost more than $5 billion.</p><p>5. (SBU) China is currently developing a number of infrastructure projects in Kenya. Currently, China Wuyi, Syno Hydro, and China Overseas Engineering Corporation are working on the Thika Road project, a major eight lane highway from Nairobi to Thika town. Another Chinese firm, Shengli Engineering &amp; Consulting Company was the prime contractor for the Mombasa-City Centre-Gigiri road upgrade project. In addition, the second phase of a project to upgrade the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) is being worked by China National Aero-Technology International Engineering Company (CATIC). The first phase of the project was completed by the Chinese company, China Wu Yi. TBEA International, another Chinese firm, is developing a 120 MW thermal plant in Longonot and 600 MW coal-fired power station in Mombasa as an independent power producer. TBEA is also undertaking projects that involve construction of 132 kV lines and sub-stations in the Rift Valley, Central, Western and Coast provinces. During a recent visit to the Olkaria geothermal development site in the Rift Valley Province, Econoff observed that Great Wall Drilling, another Chinese company, was exploring for geothermal energy. The KenGen Olkaria Geothermal Development Manager told Econoff that while he would prefer to buy quality American drills, pipes, and other geothermal-related products, American companies could not compete with China on price and price won every time in Kenya.</p><p>6. (S/NF) In January 2010, the GOK received from the GOC via CATIC weapons, ammunition, supplies, and textiles for making uniforms in support of the GOK's Jubaland initiative.</p><p>7. (S/NF) As of late August 2009, XXXXXXXXXXXX awarded XXXXXXXXXXXX  a contract to provide landline telephone monitoring equipment to XXXXXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXXXXXX  awarded the contract to XXXXXXXXXXXX  after being pressured to do so by XXXXXXXXXXXX  and XXXXXXXXXXXX . XXXXXXXXXXXX 's preference for  is based on kickbacks he received XXXXXXXXXXXX  while on a visit to China. XXXXXXXXXXXX  received monthly payments of over $5000 from XXXXXXXXXXXX which were used to pay medical bills.</p><p>8. (S/NF) As of September 2008, XXXXXXXXXXXX  As of early March 2009, Chinese technicians were working on a project in the basement of the NSIS headquarters. The presence of the technicians was well known throughout the NSIS and was causing some concern over the level of cooperation between the NSIS and its Chinese counterparts.</p><p>9. (U) The GOK and GOC recently signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement. The agreement provides a $7.3 million grant from China to Kenya. Of the grant, $150,000 will finance a computer program for the Ministry of Finance while the remaining funds can be used by the GOK to fund development projects of their choice. The agreement also covered Chinese funding of feasibility studies for the potential development of Lamu port. In addition, China committed to funding portions of the Northern Corridor road project, which links Mombasa and Nairobi to Ethiopia and Southern Sudan, as well as parts of the new Mombasa-Kampala standard gauge railway. Currently, China's Shengli Engineering Construction is refurbishing The Moi International Sports Complex at Kasarani with $12.8 million of grant-in-aid money from China. In Early 2009, China provided a $1 million grant to the GOK for the construction of a 100 bed hospital in Nairobi. In 2008, the GOK received approximately $381 million in interest-free and preferential loans, with $145 million intended for the planned ring roads aimed at decongesting Nairobi. Since 2008, the GOK has implemented campaigns to attract investment from the $1 billion China-Africa Development Fund.</p><p>10. (U) China's companies working in Kenya tend to import a substantial number of Chinese workers. This importation of labor from China tends to limit the number of Kenyans who directly benefit with wages and knowledge transfer from the projects. The low Chinese bids on major projects also push local firms out of the process, especially in infrastructure areas where capacity building of local firms would be useful. In addition, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) noticed a marked increase in poaching wherever Chinese labor camps were located and in fact set up specific interdiction efforts aimed to reduce poaching (see ref B). KWS also reports that 90% of the ivory smugglers detained at JKIA are Chinese nationals.</p><p>11. (U) The U.S. mission in Kenya has no current or pending development partnership arrangements with the GOC or any informal collaboration at the program or project level. The GOC does not participate in donor coordination in Kenya. Donors have encouraged the GOK to bring China into the donor coordination process, but no progress has been made to date. While we do not recommend it, a potential area for collaboration could include agricultural development, a USG strength and an area of Chinese interest in Africa. However, the GOC does not participate in the multilateral agricultural donors group in Kenya. The GOC could be invited to join this donors group, predicated on their willingness to sign a Memorandum of Understanding ensuring their support of Kenya's long term agriculture strategy. The World Bank recently announced a new initiative to work in cooperation with Chinese infrastructure development in Africa. This new effort seems to be aimed at working with China and African countries to maximize the benefits of Chinese development aid to the African people.</p><p>12. (SBU) Comment: Collaboration between the USG and China in Kenya should be approached cautiously as there appears to be little dovetailing of our interests to date. <em>The GOC has been silent on the implementation of the reform agenda, which we consider essential to Kenya's future stability and prosperity; the GOC turns a blind eye to the flooding of the Kenyan market with Chinese counterfeit goods, such as batteries, which directly damage U.S. market share here; and the GOC has not demonstrated any commitment to curb ivory poaching. We expect China's engagement in Kenya to continue to grow given Kenya's strategic location. If oil or gas is found in Kenya, this engagement will likely grow even faster.</em> Kenya's leadership may be tempted to move ever closer to China in an effort to shield itself from Western, and principally U.S., pressure to reform. Given the possibility of a backlash by the Kenyan people against China, perhaps over the issue of imported Chinese labor or mishandling of natural resources, there may be benefits to keeping our distance, at least publicly, from China.

The U.S. noted it would have to consider whether to impose sanctions for the tank transfer, and that a factor in U.S. deliberations would be whether the GOU was being truthful. -- Ukraine again undertook to look into specialty steel exports to Iran's missile program, while the U.S. warned that if Ukraine could not solve this problem on its own, the U.S. may take action of its own against the entities involved. -- After two years of negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine signed a contract September 24 on the removal and storage of radioactive sources. -- The U.S. also pressed Ukraine to agree to destroy more small arms under the NATO Partnership for Peace Small Arms/Light Weapons destruction project. End Summary</p><p>2. (S) In a one-on-one meeting prior to the formal meeting, Nykonenko welcomed Van Diepen to Kyiv. Nykonenko said that Ukraine was very familiar with Van Diepen's strong nonproliferation bona fides and took this as more proof that the United States had confidence Ukraine could be a strong nonproliferation partner. The sides previewed the agenda and discussed security assurances, HEU spent fuel repatriation and downblending, NATO Partnership for Peace issues related to small arms and light weapons elimination, SCUD missile elimination, missile defense, Ukrainian specialty steel exports to Iran, and Ukrainian T-72 tank exports to South Sudan. Relevant portions of the one-on-one discussion are included in the following readout of the regular meeting agenda.</p><p>HEU</p><p>---</p><p>3. (C) During the one-on-one meeting, Van Diepen said that it was particularly urgent for Ukraine to approve the shipment of the HEU spent fuel from the Kyiv Institute to Russia by the end of September. He explained that if the shipment is not approved by then, it could not take place until 2011 at the earliest, and Ukraine would continue to bear the costs and security risks of storing the material until then; that the spent fuel had no commercial value, but would be valuable to terrorists; and that, since Ukraine had been invited to the Nuclear Security Summit next year, it would be important for Ukraine to report progress in securing its nuclear materials. Nykonenko replied that Ukraine's position of February 2008 had not changed, and thus we had to wait for the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences report in early 2010.</p><p>4. (C) In meetings the next day, Vladimir Ryabtsev from Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) explained that all of the technical issues had been resolved, and Ukraine had made the decision to ship the spent fuel. They had not shipped it because it had not been worked out who would pay Russia $800,000 for addressing the waste associated with reprocessing the spent fuel. There was not enough money in Ukraine's budget to pay this expense. Wayne Leach, the DOE officer assigned to Embassy Kyiv, said that</p><p>the U.S. would send this new information back to Washington and provide an answer to Ukraine soon. (Comment: Other sources have indicated to DOE separately that the decision to repatriate this spent fuel still rests with the President and the NSDC and is still being addressed as a package along with the other Russian-origin HEU in Ukraine; in effect, that Ryabtsev may have been characterizing the debate somewhat inaccurately. The GOU has long been aware that DOE's Global Threat Reduction Initiative program does not have authority to pay for waste issues associated with such repatriation.)</p><p>Missile Defense</p><p>---------------</p><p>5. (U) In the one-on-one meeting before the plenary, Nykonenko told Van Diepen that Ukraine had read with interest the new U.S. plan for missile defense in Europe. Nykonenko pointed out that Ukraine had missile defense expertise and was interested in continued missile defense cooperation, which could help reconfirm Ukraine's role in the new European security architecture. It was 'very important' for Ukraine to receive positive signals from the U.S., he said. Van Diepen replied that the U.S. would be looking forward to discussing missile defense with Ukraine the following week during the meetings in Kyiv led by Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Vershbow.</p><p>Security Assurances</p><p>-------------------</p><p>6. (S) The first item Nykonenko raised during the one-on-meeting was an appeal for additional security assurances for Ukraine, beyond those the U.S. had provided in the 1994 Budapest Declaration. He explained that Ukraine felt threatened, particularly after the Russian invasion of Georgia. Ukraine needed a security anchor to fill the vacuum until it could join NATO. Ukraine had received the August 2009 note from the U.S. reaffirming Budapest, but it wanted to discuss the issue in more detail. Ukraine was hoping that, with U.S. leadership, a new multilateral security assurance could be worked out. The GOU would be grateful to begin expert-level talks on this; the fact of such talks would send a good signal to Ukraine's public*and neighbors. He passed a non-paper that proposed a new security assurance.  Legally binding assurances were best, he concluded, but he said he understood this was very difficult.</p><p>7. (U) Van Diepen explained that the United States' Budapest commitment endured and was not tied to the expiration of the START Treaty in December. See paragraphs 53-54 below for additional discussions on this topic and issues related to the START Follow-on Treaty.</p><p>SCUD Missile Elimination</p><p>------------------------</p><p>8. (S) Nykonenko introduced the SCUD agenda item by noting that this project is a priority for Ukraine. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense Economic Department Deputy Director Sergiy Novosyolov reiterated that point and stated that we successfully completed the first stage -- the U.S. team inventory of the SCUDs and associated equipment in June-July 2009, the various documents and annexes from each of the sites, and U.S. agreement to eliminate a portion of the melange (liquid propellant for SCUD and other missiles). Novosyolov further explained that the SCUD Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) had been approved by all the Ministries and was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for final approval and will soon be ready. He also noted that a list of possible Ukrainian contractors had been sent to the U.S. Embassy and stated GOU readiness to discuss costs, timetables, volume of work, transporting the missiles to elimination sites, and other technical and logistical factors associated with implementation of the project.</p><p>9. (S) Alexander Dotsenko, from the National Security and Defense Council, added that there are several legal issues for the Cabinet of Ministers to consider before authorizing the MOD to sign the MOU. He stated that we should schedule an experts meeting to discuss the details of the elimination work, including the specific process for selecting the contractor, tax exemption issues, and a system to monitor the work of the contractor to ensure that all of the work is completed on time and in accordance with the other terms of the contract.</p><p>10. (S) Van Diepen expressed appreciation for the excellent cooperation received from the Ukraine Ministry of Defense in the conduct of the June-July 2009 site inventories. He noted U.S. interest in moving forward to the elimination</p><p>phase of the project and hoped that the MOU would be approved soon. Paul Van-Son, from ISN's Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF) office, expressed agreement in principle to the Ukraine-proposed technical discussions, but emphasized that the MOU must be signed first. He also explained that the U.S. understood the importance of additional melange elimination to Ukraine, but noted that we would concentrate first on eliminating the SCUDs and associated equipment and melange in accordance with the MOU before discussing any further U.S. role in the elimination of additional stocks of melange.</p><p>Melange Elimination</p><p>-------------------</p><p>11. (S) Nykonenko noted that Ukraine had a dramatic melange problem, with over 16,000 tons of the rocket fuel and the steady deterioration of the storage containers. While the U.S. had committed to eliminating 1440 tons as part of the SCUD elimination project and the OSCE agreed on September 16 to eliminate 3000 tons, Ukraine was interested in additional bilateral U.S. assistance to dispose of the remaining fuel. Alexander Nilov, a rocket fuel expert from the MOD, explained that the 3000 tons would be transported by rail to Russia, where a Russian contractor hired by the OSCE would eliminate the fuel. The first shipment of melange would leave Ukraine on November 1, and the work would be completed in a year. This export of a military product to Russia was in compliance with Ukraine's export control laws, he added.</p><p>12. (S) Van-Son explained that NDF contractors are evaluating the technical capability/costs of using the Polish mobile plant that is on site at Radekhiv to eliminate the 1440 tons of SCUD oxidizer. He again emphasized that the MOU on SCUD elimination must be concluded before further discussions can take place on elimination of SCUD-associated melange. He concluded that the U.S. would like to evaluate the progress on the OSCE melange elimination project once it commences, as well as progress on the NDF SCUD project, before considering any further funding for any separate melange project in Ukraine.</p><p>13. (S) Dotsenko reminded the U.S. of his request to consider eliminating additional melange as part of the SCUD project and stated that Ukraine had met its obligation to eliminate half of its missiles and associated equipment by 2005 as it agreed to do in 1998. (NOTE: While Ukraine currently has 54 SCUD TELs, Dotsenko maintains that Ukraine possessed 117 SCUD TELs when the 1998 U.S.-Ukraine Memorandum of Understanding was signed. According to Dotsenko, Ukraine eliminated half of its SCUD force prior to 2005 using its own funds, and the U.S. should therefore consider eliminating more melange based on the 1998 numbers.) Dotsenko asked the U.S. to consider additional melange elimination projects, pointing out that Ukraine would have 13,000 tons remaining even after the OSCE project is completed. He also requested that melange elimination be included on the agenda for the next meeting.</p><p>Removal of SS-24 Solid Rocket Fuel and Elimination of Motor Cases</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---</p><p>14. (S) Nykonenko explained that, because of Ukraine's budget crisis, the water wash-out removal of SS-24 rocket fuel from the motor cases had been significantly delayed. Ukraine was continuing to adhere to the \"black box\" elimination method, under which the USG paid Ukraine a given amount of money for each eliminated motor case, regardless of how Ukraine removed the propellant. As in previous meetings, Ukraine requested additional U.S. funding for SS-24 elimination ($250,000 per rocket motor to remove the fuel in an environmentally safe manner and an additional $15,000 per empty rocket case). Nykonenko highlighted a letter sent to the U.S. Congress from the Ukrainian Rada requesting additional U.S. assistance under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program to perform this work.</p><p>15. (S) Neil Couch, from the VCI Bureau's START Treaty office, said that the U.S. remains committed to economically feasible, technologically sound propellant removal and motor case elimination as part of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program. He continued that the Department of Defense is committed to the SS-24 elimination program regardless of the end of START in December 2009, but will not pay Ukraine more than it pays Russia for the elimination of the exact same missile system.</p><p>16. (S) Sergei Birin, from the National Space Agency of Ukraine, explained that Ukraine had begun this work with 10</p><p>rocket motors. It needed $250,000 to remove the fuel from each case plus an additional $15,000 per empty rocket case for expenses related to the operation of the facility where the motors were located. Birin said that Ukraine needed an additional $6 million to complete this work, and Ukraine was waiting for the U.S. answer to its request. Ukraine had allocated $50 million to speed up the implementation of rocket fuel wash-out, but this sum was not sufficient to continue the work*operations at the Pavlohrad missile facility had been suspended. Nykonenko noted that Russia's costs were lower because it used a method that Ukraine did not regard as environmentally safe*burning the fuel out of the motors. Ukraine cannot use this method because it is located in the center of Europe and the rocket facilities where this work is done are near large population centers. He added the U.S.-Ukraine 1993 CTR Agreement stated that elimination would be completed in an environmentally safe manner.</p><p>17. (S) Couch recalled that Ukraine had agreed after four years of intensive negotiations in the START Treaty Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission (JCIC) to cut four 80-millimeter holes in the motor cases so they could not be used again as rockets, but could be used for other commercial purposes after the fuel was eliminated. Ukraine also could have crushed the motor cases or cut them in two. Birin said that Ukraine had already eliminated the fuel from four of the ten rocket motor cases in the test batch it was using to refine its wash-out technique. In the first motor case there was some residual fuel remaining that Ukraine burned out. This burn-out left big holes in the motor case such that there was no need to cut the smaller holes as agreed in the JCIC. With each successive wash-out, the amount of residual fuel remaining had been less, so Ukraine was confident it would come up with an effective technique to wash out the fuel.</p><p>18. (S) Van Diepen noted that Ukraine was having detailed technical discussions on these SS-24 elimination issues with DTRA this week. He said he would get a detailed debriefing from DTRA and forward Ukraine's remarks to the political level, which would consider Ukraine's new requests for assistance. He promised to provide Ukraine a response.</p><p>Nuclear Risk Reduction Center (NRRC)</p><p>------------------------------------</p><p>19. (C) Couch said that for several weeks the NRRC link between the U.S. and Ukraine had been out of service. The U.S. had determined that the link between Washington and Kyiv was ok, and that the problem was between the MOD and the Ukraine ground station. Nykonenko replied that Ukraine appreciated U.S. assistance to upgrade the link, and that Ukraine had completed this work. He said that Ukrainian engineers were working on the current problem and hoped to have the link back in service soon.</p><p>Wassenaar Arrangement</p><p>---------------------</p><p>20. (C) Nykonenko said that Ukraine had amended its list of military items subject to export control restrictions. In addition, it had revised the list of dual use items; that list is awaiting interagency approval. Finally, Ukraine is working to enhance the control of lathes and other items, including training, that are not on the Wassenaar or MTCR lists, but are on the EU list. Ukraine is using best practices guides for approval of exports. Van Diepen emphasized it is very important to pass national legislation to implement the export control regimes effectively.</p><p>Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)</p><p>----------------------------------------</p><p>21. (S) Tetyana Vidzigovska, State Service of Export Control of Ukraine, stated that Ukraine had implemented the changes to the MTCR Annex agreed to at the 2008 Canberra Plenary, noting that the GOU approved these changes on September 19, 2009. She also explained that the GOU is paying close attention to items not controlled by the MTCR and is considering enhancing controls over training and intangible technologies, and adopting additional controls on items going to Iran in accordance with the European Union list. Van Diepen thanked Ukraine for the update and noted that the U.S. undergoes a similar interagency process in implementing changes to the MTCR Annex.</p><p>22. (S) Boris Atamanenko, National Space Agency of Ukraine, stated that Ukraine had transferred MTCR Category I items to the U.S., Russia, Germany, and Saudi Arabia, and Category II</p><p>items to the U.S., Russia, Saudi Arabia, the Republic of Korea, China, and India during the past year. In accordance with its MTCR commitments, he noted that Ukraine had informed MTCR Partners in April 2009 (POC Document 86) of the intended Category I transfer to Saudi Arabia, and none of the Partners had objected or made an official request for further information. Van Diepen attempted to confirm that Ukraine had actually transferred Category I items to Saudi Arabia., not just notified its intention to transfer, but Atamanenko's response created confusion on this point.</p><p>23. (S) Van Diepen then said that the United States was extremely disappointed by this unwelcome news of an MTCR Category I transfer to Saudi Arabia. By definition, MTCR Category I systems are inherently capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction, and the MTCR Guidelines clearly state that such transfers should only be made on rare occasions. A principal purpose of the MTCR is to prevent the transfer of MTCR Category I items to non-MTCR countries. Van Diepen further noted that he understood that Ukraine had previously notified MTCR Partners of an MTCR Category I transfer to India, to which the U.S. objected but Ukraine transferred the items anyway. He stated that the India case was the first time that an MTCR Partner had gone ahead with a transfer when objections were made by another Partner. If Ukraine were to transfer Category I items to Saudi Arabia, that would be yet another unfortunate precedent. Van Diepen added that the U.S. would object to such a transfer, as it is our right to do as an MTCR Partner, but he said he would reserve further commentary until we get more information on what is actually being contemplated for transfer or has been transferred to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>24. (S) Van Diepen said that Ukraine should consider this discussion a formal request for more information on the Category I transfer to Saudi Arabia. He also asked that this information be provided to the U.S. well in advance of the MTCR Rio de Janeiro Plenary in November. This would allow for bilateral consultations on the margins of the MTCR Plenary on the Saudi issue as well as the broader philosophy on MTCR Category I transfers. Given the confusion over whether or not a transfer had already taken place, Van Diepen requested further clarification from Ukraine on Day 2 of the talks.</p><p>25. (C) On Day 2, Atamanenko clarified that no MTCR Category I items had yet been transferred to Saudi Arabia, but a project had been started that will result in a Category I transfer. Ukraine will not transfer any technology that would create any missile systems. Atamanenko also noted that the U.S. (ISN Director Durham) and UK had approached the GOU at the MTCR RPOC meeting in Paris in April, that they had requested further information about the sale, and had not raised concerns about the potential transfer. However, Ukraine had not received a formal written request from the U.S. or the UK for this information. Van Diepen then reiterated his 'formal' request for further information on the equipment/technology to be transferred in preparation for a robust discussion of this issue on the margins of the upcoming MTCR Plenary. (Embassy Kyiv subsequently followed up with a written request and raised the request in further meetings with MFA.)</p><p>Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>26. (S) Nykonenko said that Ukraine had participated in the ATT's Open-Ended Working Group meetings in 2009 and was looking forward to the February 2010 meetings. Ukraine supported the development of the ATT as long as it did not restrict self-defense and the legitimate production of military items. Ukraine was optimistic that an ATT could capture countries outside of the export control regimes. He said that Russia did not agree with Ukraine's position, so we needed a common strategy to deal with Russia. Nykonenko added that any Treaty negotiated without the participation of the U.S., Russia, and China would be of limited utility.</p><p>27. (S) Van Diepen said that the United States supports greater responsibility in arms transfers, reducing the destabilizing trade in illicit arms, and ensuring that all states have national systems and internal controls that meet the highest standards. In working towards these goals, we will continue to oppose lowering of international standards on the transfer of conventional arms and ensure that there is no infringement on domestic ownership of firearms. He continued that work on the ATT must be done on a consensus basis in order to ensure these objectives are met. The UK</p><p>needs to get back tQconsensus decision-making; the UK planned to introduce a resolution during the UN First Committee*the U.S. needed Ukraine's help to ensure that consensus decision-making is part of any resolution passed. Nykonenko supported the U.S. position on the feasibility of an ATT and that the two countries (along with Russia and China) needed to develop a common strategy.</p><p>Transfer Cases</p><p>--------------</p><p>28. (S) Van Diepen said that there are two types of cases the U.S. wanted to discuss on the second day of the consultations: 1) transfers to Burma and South Sudan in which there were deliberate Ukrainian government actions that are contrary to U.S. philosophy on exports; and 2) other transfers by Ukrainian entities, presumably not authorized by the Ukrainian government. The U.S. wants to work cooperatively with Ukraine to stop this second category of illicit transfers.</p><p>Burma</p><p>-----</p><p>29. (S) Nykonenko said that Ukraine had received the U.S. demarche and was no longer exporting weapons to Burma. Ukraine was just wrapping up existing contracts, and had been reducing its exports to Burma since 2005. In 2008 Ukrainian exports to Burma were 'as good as zero' in part due to previous U.S. warnings, and Ukraine had not signed any new contracts with Burma in the last two and one half years. Current exports were just spare parts. The remaining business was so small that the company involved had recalled all of its workers from Burma.</p><p>30. (S) ISN/CATR Deputy Director Brian Bachman thanked Nykonenko for the information. He said that the U.S. was still concerned about the exports to Burma, but was pleased to hear that Ukraine was now only exporting a small number of spare parts and was no longer exported completed weapons, as reports had indicated.</p><p>South Sudan</p><p>-----------</p><p>31. (S) Van Diepen recalled that when the U.S. had raised with Ukraine in July 2008 that an additional shipment of T-72 tanks, BM-1 GRAD armored vehicles, small arms, and other military equipment planned for a late June or early July shipment to Kenya was being purchased by the Kenyan Ministry of State Defense for South Sudan, Ukraine had assured us the arms were for the Government of Kenya. Ukraine had informed the U.S. that it had received an end-user certificate from the Kenyan government and receipts acknowledging the arrival of the earlier tank shipment in Kenya. Subsequent to our discussions, the M/V Faina, which was carrying another weapons shipment from Ukraine, was hijacked, and it became clear that cargo was also intended for South Sudan. Van Diepen asked if the GOU had investigated.</p><p>32. (S) Valeriy Lysenko, from Ukraine's Export Control Service, said that the T-72 tank shipment was intended for Kenya. He said Ukraine had not transferred any military equipment to South Sudan. All of Ukraine's contracts were checked.</p><p>33. (S) Van Diepen gave the Ukrainian side a copy of the contract that clearly lists the GOSS, and asked if the GOU side maintained that the export was for Kenya. Lysenko held to this line, questioned the authenticity of the contract, and asked if the U.S. had any better evidence. Van Diepen, regretting that the GOU had forced him to do so, showed the Ukrainians cleared satellite imagery of T-72 tanks unloaded in Kenya, transferred to railyards for onward shipment, and finally in South Sudan. This led to a commotion on the Ukrainian side.</p><p>34. (S) Van Diepen continued that he appreciated the sides could have different export control policies, as was their sovereign right. But not being told the truth was something the United States did not expect from a strategic partner. There was nothing for Ukraine to gain from lying and a lot to lose, he cautioned. Since South Sudan is on the U.S. terrorism list, the U.S. would have to consider whether to impose sanctions over the transfer; a factor in U.S. deliberations would be whether the GOU the truth.</p><p>35. (S) Lysenko said that Ukraine would study the U.S. information and he asserted that Ukraine only had a relationship with Kenya, and did not have a relationship with</p><p>South Sudan. Ukraine could not be held responsible for the actions of a third country. This matter was a common problem for the U.S. and Ukraine to resolve. He said Ukraine's special agencies might need to get involved to find out what had happened. Nykonenko said that Ukraine would study this situation in the light of a partner relationship so hat the U.S. would know that Ukraine is a reliable partner.</p><p>Ukraine's Exports of Specialty Metals for Iran's Ballistic Missiles</p><p>---------------------------------------</p><p>36. (S) Van Diepen said that, contrary to Ukraine's export control policy, Ukrainian entities, including XXXXXXXXXXXX, were engaged in providing the Iranian ballistic missile program with specialty metals and other sensitive items such as ball bearings used in liquid propellant missile systems. It is possible that these activities were taking place without the knowledge of the Ukrainian government. The U.S. remains deeply concerned that, given the high quality of steel that can be purchased from Ukrainian manufacturers, Iran's ballistic missile program continues to seek items from Ukrainian entities, including XXXXXXXXXXXX. Van Diepen continued that such steels have long been difficult for Iran to produce indigenously. Van Diepen provided the following points/non-paper:</p><p>-- The United States and Ukraine have discussed in the past the supply by Ukrainian firms of sensitive materials to Iran's ballistic missile program.</p><p>-- Specifically, between 2002 and 2007, we repeatedly raised concerns that Ukraine's XXXXXXXXXXXX was engaged in providing the Iranian ballistic missile program with specialty metals and other sensitive items such as ball bearings used in liquid propellant missile systems.</p><p>-- In September 2004, the United States imposed sanctions against XXXXXXXXXXXX for transferring items controlled under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) to Iran.</p><p>-- Subsequently, in May 2006, we advised you of XXXXXXXXXXXX's continued efforts to supply Iran's ballistic missile program with additional materials, including MTCR-controlled 08X22HGT titanium stabilized duplex stainless steel, which is used in the production of Scud and NoDong propellant tanks, as well as CR18NI10TI, a type of stainless steel that is not MTCR-controlled, but is used in the production of a variety of Scud engine parts.</p><p>-- We remain deeply concerned that, given the high-quality of steel that can be purchased from Ukrainian manufacturers, Iran's ballistic missile program continues to seek items from Ukrainian entities, including XXXXXXXXXXXX.</p><p>-- Such steels have long been difficult for Iran to produce indigenously. As you will recall, in late 2006 we shared with all MTCR Partners information indicating that a key choke point for Iran's missile programs is the ability to acquire advanced materials such as AISI 4340 and AISI 4130 steels.</p><p>-- Both of these steels are used by Iran's solid-fueled ballistic missile program in the production of motor cases.</p><p>-- We therefore urge you to exercise vigilance in your export control processes, and to take all appropriate measures to ensure that Ukrainian firms are not acting as sources of specialty metals to Iranian ballistic missile entities.</p><p>37. (S) Nykonenko said that Ukraine would look into the matter and provide detailed information to the U.S. Van Diepen said that if Ukraine could not solve this problem on its own, the U.S. would consider taking action by sanctioning the entities involved, including the steel companies, and by taking other measures. Iran's missiles threatened U.S. and allied troops stationed in the Middle East, so for self-defense reasons, the U.S. had to act to stop these exports. Ukraine's steel companies have benefited from trade with the West, but they could not have it both ways-- it was not in their interest to risk large profits from the West for small illicit profits from rogue states like Iran.</p><p>Ukrainian Training to Iran's Malek-Ashtar University of Technology</p><p>--------------------------------</p><p>38. (S) Van Diepen said that we recently shared with the GOU information indicating that as of early 2009, Iran's Malek-Ashtar University of Technology (MUT), as in years past, was continuing to sponsor international scientists, including from Ukraine, to provide training in Iran. Malek-Ashtar University of Technology is subordinate to Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), and provides instruction to representatives of Iran's Defense Industries Organization (DIO) as well as the Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO). The U.S. urged Ukraine to ensure that Ukrainian individuals and institutions are not providing sensitive technology, training, and/or other support to Malek-Ashtar University of Technology or other Iranian entities affiliated with Iran's missile program, and asked for the status of Ukraine's actions. Nykonenko said that Ukraine had recently received the U.S. information and was reviewing it.</p><p>Prohres-Pakistan</p><p>----------------</p><p>39. (S) Van Diepen noted that we recently provided information to Ukraine noting the interest in Pakistan's National Engineering and Scientific Commission (NESCOM) in procuring gyrotheodolites from Ukraine's Prohres. He urged Ukraine to investigate this activity and take actions to prevent any transfer of this missile-related equipment. Nykonenko said that Ukraine had recently received the U.S. information and was reviewing it.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>-------------</p><p>40. (S) Van Diepen said that there is a long history to this case and requested an update from Ukraine. He also provided additional information on this case:</p><p>-- We now have new information indicating that in August 2009, XXXXXXXXXXXX was working with representatives of China's Changda Corporation to establish a partnership related to the production of gyrotheodolites with China's Shaanxi Cangsong Machinery Plant.</p><p>-- The Shannxi Cangsong Machinery Plant is subordinate to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation Tenth Academy and manufactures inertial guidance systems for Chinese ballistic missiles.</p><p>-- Given the possible missile-related end-use of these items, as well as the identity of XXXXXXXXXXXX's potential Chinese partner, we are concerned that this cooperation could be used to support China's MTCR Category I missile programs.</p><p>-- We therefore strongly urge you to conduct further inquiries into XXXXXXXXXXXX's dealings with Chinese missile-related entities, and take all appropriate measures to ensure that  XXXXXXXXXXXX is not serving as a source of goods or technologies for China's MTCR Category I programs.</p><p>41. Nykonenko said that Ukraine is still reviewing the U.S. information on these matters. (NOTE: Ukraine provide a written update on this case at the end of the talks: \"XXXXXXXXXXXX did negotiate with China Great Wall and received licensing approval to repair a previously provided UGT-S gyrotheodolite. However, XXXXXXXXXXXX did not negotiate with the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology to transfer MTCR-controlled DOZ stellar sensors.\" END NOTE.)</p><p>G8 Global Partnership/Combating Nuclear Smuggling</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ----</p><p>42. (U) Viktor Ryazantsev of the State Committee for Nuclear Regulation, Mykola Proskura of the Ministry for Emergency Situations, and Oleksandr Panchenko of the State Border Guard Service provided detailed reports on the progress made on the range of anti-nuclear smuggling assistance projects developed with the GOU by the U.S. Nuclear Smuggling Outreach Initiative (NSOI) in January 2006. Each reported extensive progress on these projects and expressed deep appreciation for U.S. assistance in facilitating both project implementation and participation by other donors.</p><p>43. (U) NSOI Coordinator Mike Stafford agreed with them that the two sides had made remarkable progress on these projects and added that their degree of cooperation provided a model for NSOI's engagement with other governments. Stafford also noted that, in addition to progress on the assistance projects, it was important to monitor progress in implementing the agreed steps in the joint action plan that the sides had also agreed upon in January 2006 and whose</p><p>implementation the assistance projects were designed to facilitate. Stafford noted that the USG had just received from the Ukrainian Embassy earlier in the week an updated matrix indicating that 27 of the 30 steps in the joint action plan were either complete or in progress. He congratulated the GOU on this progress and secured Nykonenko's agreement to keep the U.S. side updated as implementation proceeds. Stafford also announced that NSOI had allocated $935,000 from its FY09 budget to assist monitoring on Ukraine's green border with Russia, proposed on behalf of the Preventing Nuclear Smuggling Program a workshop to strengthen Ukraine's ability to respond to nuclear smuggling incidents, and agreed to a Ukrainian request to query the Government of Finland on when a proposed mobile radiation monitoring van might be provided. (The Finnish regulatory authority subsequently reported that they hoped to provide it in December.)</p><p>44. (U) On behalf of ISN/CTR, Stafford expressed U.S. appreciation for the provision of a temporary location for the Science and Technology Center Ukraine (STCU) and requested periodic updates on construction of the permanent headquarters. Nykonenko emphasized three additional assistance projects that had been suggested by Ukraine at the most recent Global Partnership (GP) Working Group meeting, and reiterated a request that contributions by GP members to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund not be credited against their commitments to the GP. Stafford said he had investigated the latter matter after the original Ukrainian request and had learned the USG and several other GP members were counting these contributions within their GP commitments. The USG was not inclined to change this practice and thus would not ask others to change, either, especially since how to account for assistance was a sovereign decision.</p><p>Electron</p><p>--------</p><p>45. (U) Proskura said that, after two years of negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine had signed a contract September 24 on the removal and storage of radioactive sources from the Electron Gaz Plant.and the Kavetskiy Institute. Ukraine had selected the contractor, and he saw no reason why Ukraine's nuclear regulatory body would intervene to stop the work.</p><p>46. (C) Leach said that this contract demonstrated Ukraine's strong commitment to nonproliferation. The sides would begin be securing the sources at the two facilities and then would work on removing the material beginning with one-of-a-kind sources at the Institute of Physics in Kyiv. The sides would work out a way to deal with the different sources and more difficult conditions at Electron Gaz. The sides would need to work closely and cooperatively to resolve all of the problems as the project moved forward, he concluded.</p><p>NATO Partnership for Peace Destruction Project</p><p>--------------------------------------------- -</p><p>47. (U) PM/WRA Deputy Director Steven Costner noted that the sides would have detailed technical discussions the next day on this topic, but he wanted to summarize the state of play in front of the larger group. While the original Phase I of the project planned for the destruction of 15,000 tons of munitions and 400,000 small arms/light weapons (SA/LW), revised plans by NATO and the USG (as Lead Nation) was for the project to terminate when current funding ran out (around the end of March 2010), due to the GOU deciding not to destroy all of the SA/LW. This revised plan would cover 6000 tons of munitions. The good news was that munitions destruction finally had commenced, with approximately 600 tons destroyed to date, and that the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency had determined that an extra 2000 tons of munitions could be destroyed (i.e., 8000 tons total) due to interest accrued in the account. The other donors would need to approve the use of the interest for this purpose, but that was expected to be a formality. Additionally, construction on the explosive waste incinerator would begin in October. As for SA/LW destruction, over 134,000 had been destroyed to date, with the GOU recently committing to destroy another 54,000 after over a year and a half suspension of such destruction. This would bring the total destroyed to approximately 190,000 SA/LW, but would leave the project approximately 210,000 weapons short of the original goal.</p><p>48. (U) Costner emphasized that the USG had committed to engage the GOU on its proposal to convert the balance of the SA/LW into replicas for sale to see if this could be done in a way that would satisfy USG requirements that the weapons no longer function as such. If agreement was reached, the USG and NATO would commit to continuing the destruction project</p><p>and destroying the balance of the 15,000 tons of munitions as originally envisioned. However, he emphasized that U.S. laws were stringent in this regard and that experts may not reach agreement the next day. In this case, the sides would be faced with two options: 1) Ukraine would need to destroy the weapons as originally agreed; or 2) the project would be shut down, as noted above.</p><p>49. (U) Nykonenko expressed appreciation for the good news that the munitions total would be increased to 8000 tons, and expressed confidence that the experts would find a solution the following day that would allow destruction assistance to continue. (Note: The following day Ukrainian experts stated that they have recommended to the Cabinet of Ministers that the GOU agree to destroy the balance of weapons consistent with their original commitment, instead of converting them to replicas. If Cabinet of Ministers approval is attained, this will allow the project to continue. See septel for details. End Note.)</p><p>Biological Threat Reduction Initiative</p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>50. (U) Ludmilla Muherska from the Ministry of Health gave a detailed presentation on Ukraine's efforts to upgrade 18 regional medical laboratories. The Ministry of Health is also working with the MOD and the other security services to upgrade security at the laboratories. Ukraine would require additional assistance to reduce the biological threat and to complete all of this work</p><p>51. (U) Van Diepen urged Ukraine to identify expeditiously a new location for a Central Reference Laboratory (CRL) that meets DoD/CTR's conditions and he emphasized that Ukraine needs to consolidate all especially dangerous pathogens in the CRL, once completed.</p><p>52. (U) Muherska said that Ukraine is working on this complex issue and was considering several sites for the CRL. Some of the sites were located on MOD-owned property, so if selected, the site would need to be transferred to the Ministry of Health. Ukraine is hoping that it would be able to select a site soon.</p><p>Side Conversation -- Security Assurances and START Follow-On</p><p>--------------------------------------------- ---------------</p><p>53. (S) On the margins of the Nonproliferation talks, Nykonenko had three conversations with VCI/SI Deputy Director Neil Couch to clarify Ukraine's desire to participate in the START Follow-on Treaty and Kiev's security concerns. Nykonenko stated that he has been appointed as the Ukrainian Representative to the START Follow-on negotiations and, in that capacity, he wants to consult with the U.S. negotiator. He added that, despite a rocky relationship with Russia, he has met with Ambassador Antonov on four occasions and he doesn't understand why the United States has not offered similar consultations. He is willing to meet with A/S Gottemoeller at any time or place. Nykonenko reiterated his offer for Ukraine to play a mediating role between the United States and Russia in START Follow-on, citing past examples in which Ukraine had played such a role in START. Finally, Nykonenko asked that the START Follow-on Treaty contain a preambular statement that singled-out Ukraine's contribution to START implementation specifically and to nuclear non-proliferation in general. He added that it was unfair to include Ukraine in the same category as Belarus and Kazakhstan since they are members of the CIS and only do what Russia tells them to do.</p><p>54. (S) Couch asked Nykonenko to explain why Ukraine needed additional, legally binding security assurances, recalling that the 1994 Budapest security assurances provided by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation did not expire with the START Treaty in December of 2009; that the 2008 United States-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership was still in force; and that Vice President Biden''s recent speech in Kyiv had confirmed the United States' commitment to Ukrainian security. With all of these assurances, what else did Ukraine need? Nykonenko responded that Ukraine had no doubts about the commitment of the United States; however, Ukraine had serious concerns about Russia's commitment. Citing the Russian-Georgian conflict and the large ethnic Russian population in Ukraine, Nykonenko explained that if the United States would agree to new security assurances with Ukraine, then Russia would likely agree to join in the document. That is Ukraine's real desire; it views an agreement with the United States as a vehicle to bring Russia along. Nykonenko added that such an</p><p>agreement would also satisfy the two halves of Ukraine society, the westward-leaning half and the Russian-leaning half, and help quell internal tension. He also raised the issue of the Russian Black Sea Navy Base at Sevastopol, stating that Ukraine has no way of knowing how many soldiers Russia had on the base and that he believed Russia has exceeded its number of personnel allowed under the Navy Base lease. This was especially urgent for Ukraine given Russia's suspension of its CFE commitments. Nykonenko was clearly concerned that the Russians could use the Black Sea Base as jumping-off point for military action in Ukraine. (Note: A subsequent initial check with analysts at the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates no visible build-up of Russian forces at the Black Sea Navy Base. DIA is currently conducting a more thorough review of available information. End note.)</p><p>55.

Yesterday a big <a href=\"http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/20504/new_harvest.html?breadcrumb=%2Fproject%2F60%2Fagricultural_innovation_in_africa\" title=\"report \">report </a>was launched by the Harvard academic Calestous Juma with the backing of several African presidents, and next week Chatham House in London is hosting a major <a href=\"http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/food10/\" title=\"conference on food security\">conference on food security</a> where the International Fund for Agriculture and Development (<a href=\"http://www.ifad.org/\" title=\"IFAD\">Ifad</a>) is launching a new report on rural poverty.</p><p>Meanwhile Olivier De Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, warned that the current UN climate summit in Cancun needs to launch a \"Green Marshall Plan for Agriculture\" or risk a possible 40% increase in emissions by 2030 if current agricultural methods are extended.</p><p>Rising food prices and terrible future scenarios of the impact of climate change on food production, are focusing minds on what is perceived as Africa's huge untapped potential for agriculture. This week yet another <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/event/food-security-farming-and-climate-change-2050\" title=\"report\">report</a> from the International Food Policy Research Institute warns that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/01/climage-change-food-prices\" title=\"climate change could push prices up\">climate change could push prices up</a> by 130%, and calls for unprecedented human ingenuity to meet the challenge of feeding a burgeoning population.</p><p>Some of this renewed interest from around the world is self interest; countries eyeing Africa as a source of food, which is prompting an unprecedented rush to buy or lease land. But the foreign interest is matched by that of many African countries keenly aware that improving agricultural productivity is key to entrenched problems of poverty – on average 64% of Africans depend on agriculture for their income – and hunger.</p><p>Central to all the discussion is the assertion that Africa could produce far more food than it currently does. In contrast with Asia, which has seen huge increases in agricultural yields in the last 40 years, sub-Saharan Africa's track record has been abysmal. Food production is actually 10% lower today than in 1960, yet over this time period the aggregate world food production has increased by 145%.</p><p>The reasons are not hard to find. The use of fertiliser is strikingly low – only 13kg per hectare in sub-Saharan Africa compared with a north African average of 71kg. Only 24% of cereal is using improved seeds compared with 85% in east Asia. The lack of investment in nutrients has led to a catastrophic depletion of soils; 75% of farmland in sub-Saharan Africa has been degraded by overuse. As soil fertility has fallen, farmers have expanded into forests to maintain incomes, leading to deforestation – which in turn leads to more problems, for example with soil erosion such as I saw in my <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/oct/31/climate-change-mali-africa-aid\" title=\"visit to Mali\">visit to Mali</a> recently.</p><p>But if there is widespread agreement on the causes of the problem, there is an extraordinarily polarised debate about the best strategy to tackle the problem. On one side there is a powerful lobby which argues that biotechnology, massive investment in irrigation and mechanisation are the way forward, and on the other side are those who argue that these kinds of investments are usually tied up in big corporate deals in which local smallholder subsistence farmers lose out – either they lose their land or access to water, and often both.</p><p>Juma and his prestigious panel of international experts have attempted to pick a politically feasible path between these two positions. His report, A New Harvest, is being launched with the backing a clutch of presidents, including those of Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.</p><p>Inevitably, his enthusiasm for biotechnology will trigger anxieties among that alliance of European and African activists who believe that this entails Faustian pacts with multinational corporations. Another constituency will also be doubtful on the grounds that this kind of emphasis on biotech and science as the way forward in Africa lacks understanding of how development is largely a political process and crucially depends on the effectiveness of institutions – it is a weakness of westerners to believe that clever technology can sort any problem out.</p><p>One old hand in the field told me the other day that, on average, it takes 46 years for agricultural innovations to get from the laboratory to widespread use in the field in Africa; it's not lack of technology that is the problem but effective means to disseminate practical solutions. Technology might be able to achieve quick fixes in health on the continent, but they might be elusive in agriculture because it entails much more complex issues of land rights and power.</p><p>But what will delight these very critics is Juma's championing of the smallholder farmer – not as an encumbrance to development but as central to its achievement. At the very beginning – the first page of chapter one – he throws his weight behind the example of Malawi, which in 2005 defied USAid (and initially the World Bank) to put major investment into subsidised fertiliser and improved seeds in an attempt to boost maize production. Yields doubled and Malawi was meeting domestic need and exporting surplus maize within a year. Malawi became a poster-girl for western NGOs because it successfully challenged the best part of two decades of a consensus on aid in Africa – namely that the state should not subsidise smallholder agriculture.</p><p>The second example Juma chooses to highlight is even more striking. He argues that China's dramatic reduction of poverty has been achieved by growth primarily in the agricultural sector, not the industrial. Since the late 1970s, improvements in technology and infrastructure helped boost production in smallholder agriculture, with farmers' incomes rising at more than 7% a year. The result is that 200 million small-scale farmers working an average of 0.6 hectare of land are now feeding a population of 1.3 billion.</p><p>China offers a fascinating model for Africa that is radically different from the western model of high-investment, export-orientated agriculture – the carnations from Kenya model. The key to China's success, argues Juma, is \"a strong, competent, developmental state\". Unfortunately, that is what has often been lacking in sub-Saharan Africa. And to be fair, the desperate state of African agriculture is also a product of a history of structural adjustment programmes, which insisted on cutting back the role of the state in funding research and agricultural extension services of many countries.</p><p>This report clearly draws a line under that history of neglect. But the question is whether it can really mobilise the kind of investment it believes is urgently needed. The political rhetoric surrounding its launch is warm, but a note of caution. We have been here before: the Maputo declaration of 2003 pledged African countries to 10% of government spending for agriculture. Seven years on, many countries have not even reached 4%.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2010/12/3/1291375323059/africa-farming-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/dec/03/africa-agriculture-food-boost-production","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/dec/03/africa-agriculture-food-boost-production","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Africa can feed itself in a generation, says author, if leaders take up cause","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-02T21:06:37Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2010/dec/02/africa-feed-itself-generation","fields":{"body":"<p>\"Africa can feed itself.

He calls for new roads, energy sources and irrigation projects.</p><p>Some African leaders have been criticised for enriching themselves or their militaries. Juma said they had to recognise that \"agriculture and economy for Africa are one and the same\".</p><p>He told the BBC: \"It is the responsibility of an African president to modernise the economy, and that means starting with the modernisation of agriculture.\"</p><p>Juma said that food self-sufficiency would require big shifts in policies that have led to dependence on food aid and imports. His book calls for more direct involvement by political leaders in sectors such as water, energy, transport, communications and education.</p><p>Juma said the army might refuse if the agriculture minister asked them to build a road to distribute food. \"But if the president asks, they will do it,\" he said. \"The president is the commander in chief.\"</p><p>About 70% of Africans are involved in agriculture, but almost 250 million people, or a quarter of the population, are undernourished. The number has risen by 100 million since 1990.</p><p>The researchers found that, while food production has grown globally by 145% over the past 40 years, African food production has fallen by 10% since 1960. Only 4% of the continent's crop land is irrigated. Fertilisers, pesticides and high-quality seeds are prohibitively expensive and in short supply.</p><p>Juma said: \"African agriculture is at the crossroads. We have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.\"</p><p>The findings were presented in Tanzania today, where the presidents of Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi were holding an informal summit to discuss Africa's food security and climate change.</p><p>African political and economic analysts welcomed the research. Dr Greg Mills, author of Why Africa Is Poor, said: \"Agriculture is one of the areas of competitive advantage that Africa has, but in the past century we've done very badly.</p><p>\"Africa can do a whole lot more. I don't think every country is going to be self-sufficient, but many countries can be. It's not just about food self-sufficiency; it's getting the balance right between domestic crops and crops for international consumption.\"</p><p>George Mukkath, director of programmes at the charity Farm Africa, said he was in broad agreement with Juma. \"There hasn't been much reform of African agriculture. Only 10% of GDP is invested. The question is whether governments are willing to look at it as a priority.\"</p><p>He added: \"Climate change makes the whole thing more crucial. There needs to be more investment in technology for crops. \"</p><p>Fears have been expressed that \"land grabbing\" – in which wealthy countries buy or lease land in Africa to farm it for their own populations – could hurt Africa's potential for self-sufficiency.

Some 33.3m people around the world have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, according to the latest figures from the United Nations.</p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most heavily affected by HIV/Aids, although the United Nations Aids programme (UNAIDS) said in a report in September that between 2001 and 2009, new HIV infections fell by more than 25 percent in 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The key points show:</p><blockquote><p>• 22.5 million people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, around 68% of the global total<br />• An estimated 1.8m people were newly infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa in 2009, down from 2.2m in 2001. An estimated 1.3 million people in the region died from Aids-related causes in 2009<br />• Between 2004 and 2009, Aids-related deaths fell by 20% in sub-Saharan Africa<br />•  South Africa is home to the world's largest population of HIV-infected people, with 5.6m<br />• With an adult prevalence of 25.9%, Swaziland has the world's most severe level of infection</p></blockquote><p>The <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/globalreport/default.htm\">UN AIDS report</a> shows a depth of understanding of the problem. The key data is available from <a href=\"http://www.aidsinfoonline.org\">Aids info online</a>. </p><p>Using the database we were able to extract figures for:<br /><ul>\n<li>The prevalence of Aids as a % of the countries population</li>\n<li>Annual number of Aids deaths</li>\n<li>Number of Aids Orphans</li>\n<li>HIV prevention spending per capita</li>\n<li>HIV Care and treatment as a share of total HIV spending</li>\n</ul></p><p>for each country with UN data available. As you can see from the data, there are some pretty big patches of figures missing.

This act, 20 years ago, set the agenda for far-reaching transformations in the political sphere, in economies everywhere, in social interaction, even in concepts of our own identity. And Berners-Lee succeeded in doing so for one reason: he released the technology for free.</p><p>This simple decision, taken by a computer scientist used to working in environments that promoted openness and transparency, eclipses any hype about subsequent Twitter revolutions, Facebook campaigns or political protests ascribed to the platform since. The invention of the web is comparable to Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1450.</p><p>Like the printing press, the web has already been credited with ushering in an age of enlightenment; it is hailed, too, as the most powerful harbinger of social change the world has ever seen. But this isn't the first time such claims have been made. Tom Standage, author of <em>The Victorian Internet</em>, has argued that the telegraph, in the 19th century, inspired rampant technophilia. \"The telegraph was the first technology to be seized upon as a panacea,\" he has written. \"It was soon being hailed as a means to solve the world's problems.</p><p>\"It failed to do so, of course – but we have been pinning the same hope on other new technologies ever since.\"</p><p>So is the web over-hyped? In the 90s, when it still was in its swaddling clothes, revolution meant building a website brandishing the word \"REVOLUTION!\" in flashing red Comic Sans capital letters on a bright yellow background. Unfortunately, e-radicalism required a degree of technological capability. And political protests online were derivative, often no more effective than a giant billboard that people might drive by on the way to work or the shops. But everything <em>did</em> change in 2003 with the advent of a new crop of publishing platforms, blogs and social networks, that net pundits described as an entirely new phenomenon.</p><p>Stripping the hype away, this version of the web gives a new crop of cyber-revolutionaries access to a printing press, a radio station, a cable TV channel and more. Rather than virtual pamphleteering, they are developing technologies that take seed in grassroots communities. The power, as 20-year-old blogger and political activist Jody McIntyre puts it, is with the people.</p><p>In particular, there has been an explosion of technologies to circumvent censorship in countries where panic-stricken regimes have tried to stem dissident information. For example, Walid al-Saqaf developed an encryption technology called alkasir when the Yemeni government closed down his news aggregation site, <a href=\"http://yemenportal.net/\">YemenPortal.net</a>. As the son of a campaigning journalist who died in mysterious circumstances, al-Saqaf felt that it was important that he use both his journalism and IT skills to get around the blockade, \"because I felt it would have been a betrayal to my own profession to simply manipulate what people see\".</p><p>\"Information freedom is essential if you're really going to live a dignified life,\" he argues.</p><p>The Chinese government is the most infamous of web censors, but there is evidence that even its Great Firewall is collapsing at its foundations. The country's most popular blogger is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Han\">Han Han</a>, a 28-year-old author (and professional rally car driver) who posts treatises openly critical of the government, but because he speaks in the youth vernacular and enjoys such a tremendous following, his personal politics are generally overlooked by the powers that be.</p><p>As Han told me: \"Although the internet is controlled, when compared with traditional media, it better reflects reality.\"</p><p>Other political activists I spoke with are using the web's hyper-connectivity and plug-and-play capabilities to crowdsource action. Kenyan-born Ory Okolloh helped create the website <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a> in the aftermath of her country's disputed presidential election in 2007; it collected eyewitness reports of violence sent in by email and text-message and placed them on a Google map, and the open-source software has since been released freely and used elsewhere for similar projects. Tom Steinberg is the founder and director of <a href=\"http://www.mysociety.org/\">mySociety</a>, a company that builds digital tools to provide a direct pipeline between individuals, local communities and local government.</p><p>Despite traditional media's fears that they are fast becoming obsolete, there is great respect among the modern cyber-radicals for the scale of attention that newspapers and TV can bring. \"If I was running an election campaign and I had £10,000, I would still spend it all on TV ads, leaflets and posters,\" Steinberg says. \"The internet is good at all sorts of things, but shoving your message down the throats of people who don't care — which is what it takes to win a campaign – it's not particularly great at.\" But on the web, he says, \"you can make things that say, 'Go on, just have a go.'\"</p><p>In some instances, the political impulse is almost an afterthought. Christopher Poole is the American creator of <a href=\"http://www.4chan.org/\">4chan</a>, an image-centric bulletin board that he set up to discuss Japanese anime – but now its users,  or some of them at least, are making use of the anonymity that the site affords them to campaigning ends.</p><p>By contrast, Peter Sunde is the co-founder of the <a href=\"http://thepiratebay.org/\">Pirate Bay</a>, a site that allows for the peer-to-peer sharing of computer files of any kind, but one that was set up with an explicitly political purpose. Sunde now has a jail sentence hanging over him.</p><p>What today's crop of cyber-radicals demonstrate is that power does reside in the hands of the people, thanks to the foundations laid by Tim Berners-Lee 20 years ago. And a new generation of social activists are exploiting the technological tools available to them for their own agendas.</p><h2><strong>CHRISTOPHER \"MOOT\" POOLE – 4CHAN</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-369736103'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290781793590/cyber-Moot-001.jpg' alt='cyber Moot' width='200' height='232' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Christopher Poole, aka Moot, creator of 4chan.org.

He intended the site to be a place to discuss Japanese comics and anime, but it soon morphed into something far bigger. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> revealed moot's real-world identity in 2008.</strong></p><p><strong>What is 4chan?</strong><br />4chan is an image-centric bulletin board. It's based on a Japanese site called Futaba. Their code was publicly available so I downloaded a copy of their source code and translated the text from Japanese to English from an online resource. It's me, a handful of volunteer moderators and a part-time developer. For a site that has more than 10&nbsp;million users and 700 million page impressions, most people are shocked to discover that it's not a company, it's not an operation, it's our hobby.</p><p><strong>How has it evolved?</strong><br />All of its growth has been organic. We've never advertised the site; it's been word-of-mouth. Now our traffic is about 12 million unique visitors per month. Part of the way it spread is because the images that are posted lend themselves naturally to be shared via IM [instant messaging], chat or email. People see a funny or provocative image, send it to their friends, and their friends come to 4chan. The community has a very distinct culture and language, and it's responsible for creating and propagating internet memes like lolcats [amusing pictures of cats] and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK2tWVj6lXw\" title=\"Rickrolling\">Rickrolling</a> [a prank involving the video for the 1987 Rick Astley song \"Never Gonna Give You Up\"]. As that started to trickle out into the mainstream… all of a sudden, it's not just something spread as word-of-mouth by 18- to 25-year-old video game nerds; it's hit mainstream consciousness. </p><p><strong>The site is distinctive because users can post material anonymously, and some users have also organised themselves as a collective, using the name \"Anonymous\". What does that actually mean?</strong><br />As recently as six years ago, people were used to forums where you could lurk, you could view, but in order to post and participate, you had to register. Because you didn't need to register on 4chan, people started to appreciate it, and realise how radically different it was. We began to see anonymity not just as an aspect or feature, but as a thing, as a principle, as an idea that we are one, we are a collective, we are Anonymous. People then came to the site who not only saw Anonymous as a principle, but started to exploit anonymity as a new platform where they could be rebellious and no one knew who they were.</p><p><strong>\"Anonymous\" started a protest movement against the practices of the Church of Scientology two years ago. Were you complicit in their activities?</strong><br />I didn't start 4chan as an outlet for dissenting voices and freedom of speech. At first the community was so tame. But as it became less tame, I felt there was something there worth protecting. The rise of social networking is an assault on the free, the open, the anonymous web. I started to appreciate that 4chan is one of the last bastions of freedom online. Anonymity – including anonymous posting – is something to be protected. 4chan is very privileged to be one of the last places for this type of discourse, for this type of interaction. That's important. That's why I've decided to be hands-off and to protect it as a place, and to deliver  a platform.</p><p><strong>Why?</strong><br />Anonymity allows you to express and view opinions, images you wouldn't necessarily be comfortable with elsewhere. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to be negative. It's not about, \"You can't say fuck on Facebook&nbsp;but you can on 4chan.\" Services where you have a persistent, registered identity such as Twitter and Facebook – in many cases it's your real identity – limit what users want to say and read. But you can on 4chan. It is an&nbsp;outlet. I was invited to speak at Facebook to provide an alternative and opposite perspective to theirs. Mark Zuckerberg's point of view is that anonymity and monikers and pseudo-identity represents cowardice. He said that if you have nothing to hide, what's the big deal? Why would you be concerned about putting all this stuff on your profile? Well, I'm not a zealot and people like what Facebook is doing. But there is a place for both. They both&nbsp;offer powerful utilities for different needs.&nbsp;The world still needs a Google,&nbsp;and Facebook. But it also needs&nbsp;the anonymous, ephemeral, open 4chan.</p><p><strong>Are there any rules?</strong><br />There is a set of codified rules and we&nbsp;do enforce them: don't break the&nbsp;law or post anything illegal.  Past that, the users are left to their  own devices.</p><h2>ORY OKOLLOH - USHAHIDI</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-369736104'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290781977254/cyber-Ory-001.jpg' alt='cyber Ory' width='200' height='250' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ory Okolloh, founder of Ushahidi.

We build tools for democratising information and increasing transparency – we're lowering the barriers for individuals to share their stories.

Essentially, I was going to college every morning and bus drivers wouldn't let me on the bus because I was in a wheelchair. So in response to these feelings, I began writing the blog, detailing my experiences.</p><p><strong>Why use the web?</strong><br />If you're not given a platform by others, you'll make your own. If your form of resistance is writing, then you will find any means necessary to get that writing out into the public consciousness, even if you have to write it on a piece of paper and pin it up on walls around London – [but] the way I saw it, everyone I knew was going on the internet.</p><p><strong>What is it about digital tools that make them effective in galvanising people?</strong><br />I don't think the internet is some kind of grand solution that will solve all our problems, but it helps because of its capacity to reach people across the world. A lot of revolutionaries talk about the necessity of encouraging revolution and resistance in any context around the world. If we're writing on the internet, the hope that someone in Kashmir or Palestine or Iraq can read what you're writing is a good one. With the web, people in power can't edit or co-opt what we've said. I can publish whatever I want to say. They can't censor our voices any longer. You can say whatever you like about Julian Assange and Wikileaks, but you can't change the video or the images that a million people saw in one day of American soldiers eager to kill Iraqi civilians. People see those images and know the truth is in front of their eyes.</p><p><strong>What are its shortcomings?</strong><br />We need to realise that most people in the world don't have access to the net. The internet is just the first step. The movement we want to build, the revolutionary movement for equality for all people, can only happen through direct action, and direct action on the streets. The internet can play a role in our political education, raising our political consciousness, but as long as people remember that this is a way to plan action, to organise ourselves, to connect people, but not the solution, then we'll be OK.</p><h2>HAN HAN – BLOGGER</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-369736106'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/Gallery_Images/2010/11/26/1290787796456/Cyber-Han-Han-001.jpg' alt='Cyber Han Han' width='200' height='268' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Han Han a professional rally driver, bestselling author, singer, creator of a literary magazine and China's most popular blogger. Photograph: Ym Yik/epa/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The 28-year-old Chinese professional rally driver, bestselling author, singer, creator of a literary magazine and China's most popular <a href=\"http://www.hanhandigest.com/\">blogger </a>– indeed, possibly the most popular blogger in the world.</strong></p><p><strong>What are your greatest criticisms of the Chinese government and the current political climate there?</strong><br />The Chinese Communist party puts keeping their political position first above everything. Of course, this is the wish of many political parties around the world. For the Chinese government, the reality is that regardless of whether the people are satisfied or unsatisfied, the party's position will always be secure. However, they are sometimes nervous, sometimes arrogant and this attitude has caused many tragedies.</p><p><strong>What impact do you hope your web activity will have on the political system?</strong><br />Although China has many idealistic journalists and media figures, the media are still controlled and censored. Although the internet is controlled, when compared with traditional media it better reflects reality. Rather extreme views or false information may sometimes appear on the internet, but it's only because traditional media fail to take the responsibilities they should take. The government might think the internet is really annoying, but I think it actually helps the government.</p><p><strong>How do you think internet-based social change is different in China?</strong><br />The only difference is English-speaking countries treat the internet as technology, while Chinese-speaking countries treat the internet as medicine.</p><p><strong>How did you decide the internet was the best mouthpiece for your views? You already had a profile in traditional media, so why not use them?</strong><br />It's faster and more direct. It's almost impossible to publish sensitive articles in traditional media. Even though others might delete your writing online, at least you can publish your opinion completely. I don't write articles to oppose a specific party or government; my articles could criticise any party. I'm a writer. How can I call myself an intellectual if I can't write and publish words as I wish?</p><p><strong>Why do you feel you can get away with statements against the government that other people wouldn't?</strong><br />The atmosphere is not as terrifying as people in the west may think. Sometime my articles do get censored, but besides those who advocate policy changes and democratic reform, the government actually doesn't often control or censor writers. The writers here have become smarter: they know what to write and what not to write.</p><p><strong>How have you dealt with resistance from your detractors, in particular the Chinese government?</strong><br />They can only censor my articles, not my thoughts. I can accept this type of censorship. It's a game, and I'm playing by other people's rules. I don't think the government disagrees with the ideas in the articles that were censored; they are afraid of the ideas spreading.</p><p><strong>What effect do you feel you are having on the political psyche of China's youth?</strong><br />I can't really influence them in any way, but I hope that when the country is one day in their hands they will remember the past and take good care of this nation. In that world there is no capitalism, socialism, communism or feudalism; there is also no westernisation or easternisation. There is only right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, good and evil.</p><p><strong>Where will the most radical change brought about by the web be felt in 10 years?</strong><br />I'll answer this question in 2013, when we have confirmation that the world still exists. Otherwise my answer now will be rubbish.</p><h2>PETER SUNDE – THE PIRATE BAY</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-369736107'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290782169412/cyber-Sunde-001.jpg' alt='cyber Sunde' width='200' height='250' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Peter Sunde, co-founder of The Pirate Bay. Photograph: Richard Saker for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The 32-year old Swedish co-founder of the <a href=\"http://thepiratebay.org/\">Pirate Bay</a>, the world's leading file-sharing site, allowing users to exchange music, games, videos and more. Found guilty, along with his colleagues, of assisting others in copyright infringement in 2009; lost his appeal last week (after this interview took place) and now faces eight months in jail and a fine shared with his colleagues of £4.1m.</strong></p><p><strong>What is the Pirate Bay?</strong><br />The Pirate Bay was a project developed as part of an \"anti-anti-piracy group\" started in Sweden called Piratbyrån. Pirate Bay blew up because other file-sharing sites were being shut down because of legal pressure from Hollywood. Most of the other sites were run by 16-year-old guys, and when you're that age and you get a letter from a Hollywood attorney saying they're going to sue you for all the money in the world, you shut down your site. We wanted to make a statement and take on the fight. The internet is based on the idea that everyone can share whatever they want. If you start having gatekeepers you have a consumer-and-producer relationship. We didn't like the idea that corporations would take the internet and turn it into cable TV.</p><p><strong>What philosophy lay behind your attitude?</strong><br />We were influenced by Public Enemy and the KLF. And by traditional French philosophers, rather than by any US west coast libertarians.</p><p><strong>What makes you think that the free sharing of files online can be right?</strong><br />I grew up with computers. I got my first computer when I was nine, and everything I learned about computers was from copies. I wouldn't be able to program if it wasn't for illegally copying my first programming language compiler.</p><p><strong>How did your attitude develop?</strong><br />I started reading academic papers about file sharing that said it is good for the community; it's good for the artist. The only people who lose are the record companies and the studios. Copyright is based on the notion that there are certain companies who should be able to profit from culture. It's not based on the idea any more that people who create things should be able to benefit, or get money for it. Copyright is boring, so no one really wants to get to know it. It's such a big legal field, so the companies who can profit from it have a free arena to dictate terms. But the internet removed the middleman. I don't understand why&nbsp;that's a bad thing. I see the situation in the same way as discovering a car that runs on water and the oil companies forbidding water to be used in cars.</p><p><strong>Why is the web important?</strong><br />It means there are no gatekeepers any more. You have the power to influence people as quickly as you can connect with the internet. With Twitter and Facebook you don't even need to create your own publishing platform. You just have to have an idea. In Sweden, after the recent election, a 17-year-old immigrant girl created a Facebook group calling for a demonstration against the [rightwing, nationalist Sweden Democrats] who were voted into office. Ten hours later, 6,000 people showed up and started demonstrating.</p><h2>WALID AL-SAQAF – YEMEN PORTAL</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-369736108'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290782808118/cyber-Walid-001.jpg' alt='cyber Walid' width='200' height='249' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Walid al-Saqaf, creator of Yemen Portal. Photograph: James Duncan Davidson/TED</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The 37-year old Yemeni activist is the creator of <a href=\"http://yemenportal.net/\">Yemen Portal</a> and of software used to circumvent firewalls.</strong></p><p><strong>What is Yemen Portal?</strong><br />YemenPortal.net is a news aggregator. More than 90% of the content is in Arabic. It gathers information or news articles released on official news websites and through dissident and independent sites, and puts them together to present a comprehensive view of what's happening in Yemen. This feature has allowed a lot of people to look into dissident content they didn't know&nbsp;about.</p><p><strong>Why was this necessary?</strong><br />The traditional media in Yemen are very restrictive, and the broadcast media are monopolised by the state: you wake up in the morning in Yemen and turn on the news on TV and you find that all the news is about the president's meetings and the government's meetings.</p><p><strong>How did the government respond to the fact that an increasing readership was discovering dissident content through Yemen Portal?</strong><br />They simply blocked access to it, to the whole site from within Yemen. So I had three choices: give way and let the government control what did and didn't appear on my site; shut it down altogether; or keep the controversial content and find ways to allow people to access the site. I chose the latter, because I felt it would have been a betrayal to my professsion to manipulate what people see. I developed a piece of software called alkasir. If you were browsing the net and wanted to open your Gmail, your Gmail would go through the regular internet service provider. But when you open a blocked website, it activates itself and changes into the encrypted proxy mode. That's better than anonymising everything because if you do that, you give the impression to the monitors at the ISP that there is a fishy connection.</p><h2>TOM STEINBERG – MYSOCIETY</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-369736109'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290783068270/cyber-Tom-008.jpg' alt='cyber Tom' width='200' height='240' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tom Steinberg, founder of mySociety. Photograph: Anna Gordon for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The 33-year old founder of <a href=\"http://www.mysociety.org/\">mySociety</a>, which has developed websites in the UK including TheyWorkForYou and WriteToThem, aiming to bring greater transparency to government.</strong></p><p><strong>What is mySociety?</strong><br />MySociety builds websites that give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and democratic parts of their lives. We run various democracy and transparency sites in the UK that do things like make it really easy to find out how your politicians voted or, on a more local level, help you report problems to the council, such as potholes and broken streetlights, or get information out of government that you might want via the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p><strong>How can the web be used as a tool to influence people?</strong><br />The internet enables you to help people to achieve things they might want to get done in their lives and in their communities on a scale that is not possible unless you are using such a cheaply scalable digital technology.</p><p><strong>How has it transformed the political process?</strong><br />There is no one thing that is \"internet politics\". There really are two worlds: partisan campaigning to exert power and to beat your opponents into a pulp; and the creation of what you might call empowering platforms using general-purpose tools that let people communicate, act, exert power or achieve goals like requesting information out of the government. These two really different things often get bundled together. There's actually quite a big difference between the way that Barack Obama used what was essentially an extremely good credit card form to raise $500m through his website, taking that money and using it to buy TV adverts and posters to beat the Republicans, versus services like those that we run. We build platforms so that people can achieve potentially smaller things that are not so single-minded in purpose.</p><p><strong>What it is that you want to change by building these platforms?</strong><br />We get people who've never tried to campaign on anything, they've never written to a politician, but if you make the barrier low enough and give them a reason, you'll push them over the edge.</p><p><strong>Is the best way to influence the public to give them the tools or the messages?</strong><br />If I was running an election campaign and I had £10,000, I would still spend it all on TV adverts, leaflets and posters. The internet isn't massively good at making people think things they don't currently think. It's very good at helping people to do things when they decide that they want to. I think that TV and adverts on the side of buses will be playing a dominant role in politics for a long time to come. But I'm a great believer that the internet will strengthen the community on your street because it can bring together people who care about an issue who didn't previously have a voice, so that they can then shout loudly enough to make political bodies and organisations pay attention.</p><p><strong>Are you trying to transform local politics?</strong><br />It would be lovely if measurably more people in the future felt they could realistically be part of the solution if there was some problem in their community, that it's not just something unimaginably over their heads that's dealt with by another class of people that they never meet. I am out to give as many people as I can a better experience of dealing with the democracy they live in and the government that rules over them.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2010/11/26/1290795549624/cyber-radicals-001.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/28/internet-radicals-world-wide-web","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2010/nov/28/internet-radicals-world-wide-web","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Population of African cities to triple: Get the data","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-23T15:06:54Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2010/nov/23/african-city-population-grows","fields":{"body":"<p>The population of African cities is set to triple over the next 40 years according to a report by UN-HABITAT.</p><p>The report entitled <a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=9141&amp;catid=7&amp;typeid=46&amp;subMenuId=0&amp;AllContent=1\">The State of African Cities 2010: Governance, Inequalities and Urban Land Markets</a> shows <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa/roundup\">Africa</a> facing a remarkable rise in urban population.</p><p>Cairo is set to grow by 23% over the next 15 years with a projected figure of 13.5 million inhabitants by 2025.

and Ushahidi collaborate on Project Activate","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-22T18:02:03Z","sectionId":"activate","id":"activate/blog/activate-ushahidi-project-activate","fields":{"body":"<p>Next week the Guardian will welcome the open source platform <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com\">Ushahidi</a> to its headquarters in North London for a week long engagement as part of the Activate Summit's fundraising and tech development initiative entitled <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/blog/call-to-action\">Project Activate</a>. </p><p>Those familiar with Ushahidi and its work can skip the next couple of paragraphs, but for the uninitiated (have you been living under a rock for the last four years?!) the Nairobi-based start up takes its name from the Swahili for 'testimony' or 'witness' and is a crisis crowdsourcing platform which combines social activism, citizen journalism and geospatial information. </p><p>Born out of the disputed 2007 presidential elections in Kenya, the website enabled the mapping of eyewitness reports of violence sent in by some 45,000 users through email and text-message in the aftermath of the elections at the beginning of 2008. This source of on-the-ground, real-time information enabled global reporting and co-ordination of aid and peace efforts at a time when international news and aid organisations had been paralysed by a Government-led media black out. </p><p>It has since been employed as a crisis management and relief tool for a number of human and natural disasters including during the fallouts from the devastating earthquakes in Haiti and Chile. Under the watchful management of co-founders Ory Okolloh, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/video/activate-2010-juliana-rotich\">Juliana Rotich</a>, Erik Hersman and David Kobia, Ushahidi has fast become a darling of the open web movement and only last week Okolloh received the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.beet.tv/2010/11/kenyas-crowd-mapping-start-up-ushahidi-launches-commerical-effort-.html\">Monaco Media Prize</a>, an honour granted in the past to no lesser names than Jimmy Wales and Lawrence Lessig. </p><p>And so, for four days (and no doubt some late nights) in wintery London Ushahidi core developer <a href=\"http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2009/09/11/welcoming-brian-herbert-to-the-ushahidi-team/\">Brian Herbert</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2009/12/14/jon-gosier-joins-the-swift-river-initiative/\">Jon Gosier</a>, director of Ushahidi's <a href=\"http://swift.ushahidi.com/\">SwiftRiver</a> platform (which helps to filter and validate large amounts of information for use on the main platform), will fly out from the US to work alongside the Guardian tech and developer team to share ideas, insights and visions for future collaboration. </p><p>The aim is to see if we can help streamline and enhance some of Ushahidi's capabilities, to better understand the practicalities of application and benefits of use of the platforms for media companies such as ours and ultimately to find and create the basis for some longer term projects between our two organisations. A lot of the conversations have already been happening online in the lead up to the end of Nov trip so we're hoping everyone will hit the ground running and we'll be able to do some really fantastic work. </p><p>This is the second time we've run the Project Activate fundraising and tech dev drive off the back of the Summit - the first one came in 2009 when we worked with the inspirational <a href=\"http://www.swradioafrica.com/\">SWRadio Africa</a> team under the guidance of director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/video-gerry-jackson-sw-radio-africa\">Gerry Jackson</a>. </p><p>It's no surprise to note the similarities between SWRadio and Ushahidi - both have their roots in upholding the principles of democracy and both exhibit an unwavering faith in the power of technology and human interconnectedness to challenge institutionalised failure and corruption. They are born of an emerging system where injustice motivates, technology enables, humans create and the internet amplifies and proliferates. </p><p>Project Activate is indicative of the Guardian's commitment to empowering these kinds of grass root organisations that often spring out of a horrendous set of circumstances and yet in spite (or perhaps because of) this, they thrive to become bastions of free speech and transparency and to epitomise the notion that we are stronger as an open and connected world. They also celebrate creativity, adaptability and mutualisation in modern journalism which are key tenets of the Guardian canon, as outlined by our editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger in his recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jan/25/cudlipp-lecture-alan-rusbridger\">Hugh Cudlipp lecture</a>. </p><p>So both for Activate and the Guardian Ushahidi are a natural partner and we can't wait to see the results of our working together.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2010/8/13/1281713875091/Ushahidi-map-of-Port-au-P-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/activate/blog/activate-ushahidi-project-activate","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/activate/blog/activate-ushahidi-project-activate","sectionName":"Activate"},{"webTitle":"Prince William and Kate Middleton engagement: live coverage ","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-16T11:33:49Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/blog/2010/nov/16/prince-william-kate-middleton-engagement","fields":{"body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p><strong>11.17am:</strong> <br />It's official. There is to be a royal wedding next summer. Clarence House has today confirmed that Prince William and Kate Middleton are to marry. Here's the full statement:</p><blockquote><p>The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince William to Miss Catherine Middleton.</p><p>The wedding will take place in the Spring or Summer of 2011, in London. Further details about the wedding day will be announced in due course.</p><p>Prince William and Miss Middleton became engaged in October during a private holiday in Kenya. Prince William has informed The Queen and other close members of his family. Prince William has also sought the permission of Miss Middleton's father.</p><p>Following the marriage, the couple will live in north Wales, where Prince William will continue to serve with the Royal Air Force.</p></blockquote><p>I'm sure you will all want to rejoice at the news in the comments section below. The moderators have been warned.</p><p>Before you all wade in with what will no doubt be robust views on whether we shoud live blog this announcement and its aftermath, the prospect of the wedding does raise some important questions:</p><p>• The wedding is likely to be a key test of feelings towards the monarchy since the last big royal wedding in 1981. How much has republican sentiment increased since then?<br />• Will the wedding itself change public opinion towards the royal family – positively or negatively?<br />• In the age of austerity and cutbacks who is going to pay for it and how much will it cost? Will it be an austerity wedding?</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>11.36am:</strong> Top marks to Ed Miliband for being one of the first to offer congratulations. He tweeted this a few minutes ago.</p><blockquote><figure data-media-id='gu-image-368755586'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/08/twitter.gif' alt='Live blog: Twitter' width='40' height='40' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Delighted for Prince William and Kate Middleton on their engagement. The whole country will be wishing them every happiness.</p></blockquote><p>He won't be the last.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>11.49am:</strong> What will she wear? The <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1327407/Has-Kate-Middleton-Royal-wedding-dress-designer.html\">Mail on Sunday has been researching this key question for some time.</a></p><p>It reports that her favourite designer is Daniella Issa Helayel. It quotes a friend: \"She loves Issa's look and wears it well. Kate knows she's going to need conservative yet attractive outfits once they are engaged and she's started collecting a very enviable wardrobe.\"</p><p>Speaking to PA Peta Hunt, fashion director at You &amp; Your Wedding magazine, has this crucial insight:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I can't see it will be covered in Swarovski crystals. I think it will be hand embroidered and I think with lace.\" </p><p>She must have some sort of crown or tiara. I would imagine shoulders would be covered at some stage. I think a high neck would look fantastic. It's quite refined and could be quite stylish.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>11.55am:</strong> Reams of pre-written copy is spewing out of PA, such as this</p><blockquote><p><br />He reportedly calls her \"Babykins\", while he is apparently her \"Big Willie\". </p></blockquote><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>12.00pm:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.republic.org.uk/What%20we%20want/In%20the%20news/?command=fe_show_press_release&amp;press_release_id=316&amp;date__date__year=&amp;date__date__month=&amp;date__date__day=\">Republicans are already complaining about the likely cost.</a></p><p>Here's Graham Smith, spokesman for Republic:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm sure this is very happy news for those who know the couple, but it is a private matter and we mustn't see the government wasting limited resources paying for a major set-piece event.</p><p>William is not the head of state, there is no guarantee he will ever be head of state.  This is a private occasion which I'm sure the palace will want to milk for maximum PR effect.  It is not for the taxpayer to pay for any part of this event, the Windsors must cough up.\"</p><p>Inevitably there will be additional security arrangements for the wedding, but that must be paid for by the Windsor family from their own personal fortunes, not by taxpayers who are experiencing sweeping spending cuts.</p><p>If people are being told to tighten their belts, if the government is making thousands unemployed, if welfare payments are being slashed, it would be sickening for the government to allow a single penny more to be spent on the royals at this time.</p><p>Spending public money on this wedding or affording it any special status would be no more appropriate than if it were Ed Miliband's wedding.  This is a private occasion.</p><p>We are certain the palace spin doctors will be working overtime to use this opportunity to their advantage.  Republic today makes this pledge to do all it can to counter that PR campaign and continue to push the case for  a modern and democratic institution in place of the monarchy.</p></blockquote><p>That reads like something Republic made earlier. It is not just royal correspondents who have pre-written material on this.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>12.08pm:</strong> A good day to bury bad/awkward news?

The environmental movement needs to change.  The world is radically different than it was in the 1960's and 1970's when the modern movement was formed.  The environmental movement needs to mature its view of the role of people, technology and corporations.  People are the solution not the problem.  Technology and innovation allows us to survive on a resource-limited planet.  Big corporations are not always the enemy.   </p><p>But the filmmakers of \"What the Green Movement Got Wrong\", in their exuberance to make their point, blamed environmentalists for starvation in Africa and energy scarcity throughout the world. That blame is misplaced.  Of all those at fault for drought and food shortage in Zambia, environmentalists rank low on the list.  The environmental community has been too short on solutions, but to view the environmental movement as a shadow government is to badly misread reality.  Indeed, environmental groups have raised the alarm about food and energy scarcity. To blame environmentalists for the problems they identify is like blaming women for misogyny.   My mentor David Brower, a legendary American environmentalist, liked to say that \"politicians are like weather veins and our job is to make the wind blow.\"  Environmentalists attempt to move public opinion, they don't set public policy. The environmental community can hardly be blamed for the lack of transparency in the nuclear and biotech industry that has been  at the heart of public concern.  </p><p>That I and other lifelong greens have critiques of the environmental movement is no secret; in 2004 I gave a widely-circulated speech entitled \"Is Environmentalism Dead?\"  But as I shared with the filmmakers in footage not selected for broadcast, I am and have always been a passionate supporter of the very groups I criticize.  They have been the thin green line that has blocked short-sighted politicians and corporations from turning our last wild forests into toilet paper, our last whales into sushi, our atmosphere into an open sewer.  While I have disagreements with Stewart Brand, I have always respected him and I'm the first in line to say that the environmental movement needs to review its most sacred beliefs.  But this film misses the mark.  </p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/nov/04/channel-4-convenient-green-fiction\">George Monbiot, Guardian columnist and author of Heat</a></h2><p>Stewart Brand ends the documentary by demanding that we set aside the joys of ideology and romanticism. But this is one of the most romantic and ideological films I've ever seen. It expresses the profoundly romantic belief that technology alone can solve political and economic problems, and suggests that we needn't make hard choices, such as restraining consumer demand. The idea that wealth and power don't have to be confronted to protect the environment and to ensure that everyone is fed is deeply ideological. It's a convenient ideology - if you're trying to rub along well with corporations and governments. Brand's approach, which the film is based on, is not so much a new form of environmentalism as a new form of corporate consultancy: he appears to be seeking to shape the environmental debate to suit the businesses he works for. </p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/cif-green/2009/dec/09/copenhagen-kyoto-climate-change\">Tim Flannery, author of The Weather-Makers and chairman of the Copenhagen Climate Council</a></h2><p>What the Green Movement Got Wrong' posits that the anti-nuclear and<br />anti-GM crops stance taken by some environmentalists has been<br />counter-productive. This is, in my view, very much a debate the<br />environment movement needs to have.</p><p>Far less positive it its inference that environmentalists have dealt with<br />climate change in a counter-productive way. This assertion is poorly<br />based, and moreover lets the climate sceptics, who are really to blame for<br />our slowness to action, off scott-free.</p><p>One of the program's greatest weaknesses is that it uses the terms<br />'greens' and 'environmentalists' so as to smear the entire movement with<br />the perceived sins of a few. While regrettable and lazy, it would be a<br />pity to toss the baby out with the bathwater. I hope that all concerned<br />with the environment use the issues raised in the program to think more<br />deeply about what a sustainable future might look like.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/about/dr-doug-parr-chief-scientist\">Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace</a></h2><p>As a scientist working for an environmental group, the documentary's proposition that we are anti-science and ideological is simply not one I recognise. The reality is we're pro-science and very pragmatic. Our biggest campaign on climate change would not exist if we didn't hold science in high regard. Our pragmatism in delivering real change means some surprising alliances. We worked with McDonalds on stopping Amazon deforestation and with Coca-Cola on greener refrigeration to protect the ozone layer and prevent climate change. We don't share all the values of these corporations but are pragmatic enough to realise what working with them could deliver. Because of that very pragmatism we've been accused of abandoning our values– so to now be accused of being ideological is bizarre. We are also not ideologicaly or dogmatically opposed to nuclear and GM technologies.  We've looked at what they can do and see better alternatives – we believe GM and nuclear would institutionally block those better alternatives from blossoming. But if the evidence changes then so will our position.  </p><h2><a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/about/andrew-simms\">Andrew Simms, policy director of the New Economics Foundation</a></h2><p>If you suggest that it is better to mend a bicycle with a spanner than a fish, does that make you anti fish? Brand and Lynas try to label environmentalists as anti-science and anti-progress. But both they, and the corporate lobbies promoting GM food and nuclear power, fail to acknowledge that the green movement is merely in favour of different applications of science, ones they conclude are more likely to deliver better progress. The question should be, which tool is best for the job? Who holds the fish, and who the spanner? Brand and Lynas are waving fish. A wide range of agro-ecological farming methods coupled with land reform and economic support to small farmers are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2003/aug/04/greenpolitics.famine\">more proven, more productive and more likely to reliably feed the poor than GM</a>.</p><p>And, numerous, quicker, <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18625064.200-new-uk-nuclear-plants-could-prove-costly.html\">cheaper</a>, safer and more efficient climate friendly energy strategies and technologies than nuclear <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/200510030053\">are available</a>.</p><p>The programme had an oddly emotive pitch. Whilst shrouding itself in science, it displayed a very unscientific faith in particular technologies. Considering the multiple other solutions on offer for human hunger and climate change, the curious, unsettling question, left unanswered, is why do GM food and nuclear power get such disproportionate attention?</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/craig_bennett_31082010.html\">Craig Bennett, Friends of the Earth's director of policy and campaigns</a></h2><p>Last night's Channel 4 documentary was supposed to reveal a radical new approach to saving the planet. But, like the companies peddling the GM and nuclear technologies the programme pushed, it promised much and delivered little.</p><p>There's nothing new about GM and nuclear.  Both have been around for decades, both are expensive and ineffective and both are distractions. The documentary urged us to engage with technology, science and people to deliver the solutions that are so urgently needed. </p><p>But this is precisely the approach that Friends of the Earth has followed for years – focussing on driving the right kinds of changes and winning campaigns that make a real difference on the ground.</p><p>After all, it's because of the people who took action with us that the UK has the world's first climate change law, requiring emissions cuts in line with what scientists say is needed.  [<a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/news/channel_4_story_wrong_about_greens_25787.html\">More from Friends of the Earth</a>]</p><h2><a href=\"http://africanbiodiversity.org/abn_old/index.html\">Zachary Makanya of PELUM-Kenya and chair of African Biodiversity Network</a></h2><p>What the Green Movement Got Wrong\" was an insult to the very people it purports to care about.  The programme did not include Southern farmers' voices, and implied that Africans do not have the intelligence to think for themselves.  The ABN is here to dispel that myth and to tell the film's producers that it is they who have failed to understand the real issues.\"</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/aboutus/seniorstaff/benpage.aspx\">Ben Page, chief executive at pollsters Mori IPSOS</a></h2><p>I think the programme probably posted a false dichotomy between different parts of the green movement, but it is true that those greens who present apocalyptic visions of temperature feedback loops have the effect of reinforcing the views of the many who tend to view global warming as like death and taxes: inevitable but unpleasant and therefore better not to think about.</p><p>However it is not the green movement's positioning per se that is behind the decline in concern about climate change of the last few years (those who think it is happening are down from 91% to 78%): but the media giving disproportionate coverage to the tiny minority of scientists who disagree with it, and a very cold winter, that are more to blame. My personal position is that we need both technology and considerable changes in consumption to cope with it: it is only by avoiding extreme positions (as the public would see them) that one can take people with you. </p><h2><a href=\"http://www.sandbag.org.uk\">Michael Buick, director of emissions trading campaigners Sandbag</a></h2><p>Luckily the documentary was not a loud \"Ha-ha! Green crazies admit they were wrong\", as it could easily have been given C4's patchy record on environmental issues, and the anti-Greens amazing ability to turn the facts on their head. The diverse and eclectic 'Green movement' can name some of the century's most passionate, selfless and ultimately foresighted people amongst its ranks. As the documentary showed there have been many successes that we all benefit from. And yes some alarms were sounded without good reason, some perhaps simply too early to be taken seriously.</p><p>Yet the larger theme of 'What the Greens got wrong' struck a chord. Not about nuclear energy or GM crops, but about the natural bias towards the 'No' word, the puritanical streak and misanthropy found too often in our ranks. We need whistleblowers, and the 'Greens' have had many. But we also need entrepreneurs. After the 'not this way' MUST come a 'here's a better option'...</p><p>The instinctive 'no' of the green movement has been on clear display when it comes to emissions trading. The idea of using the power of markets to protect the earth's ecology is new, radical and full of problems and pitfalls. But we need bold new ideas to move forward. In a crisis all suggested solutions with real potential should be taken seriously. It is clear that a good number of carbon trading's most passionate opponents get their drive not from a reasoned assessment of the pros and cons, but from a raw dislike of capitalism. They are quite simply cheesed off that a system they object to should find a way to adapt to a problem of (perhaps largely) its own making. Shouldn't it rather throw it's hands up 'mea culpa' and humbly beat a retreat? [<a href=\"http://www.sandbag.org.uk/blog/2010/nov/5/what-show-got-right/\">More from Sandbag</a>]</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.plants.leeds.ac.uk/groups_atk.html\">Professor Howard Atkinson, plant scientist at the University of Leeds</a></h2><p>By 2030, our warming world will have 50% more mouths to feed. To avoid a food crisis without stripping the planet of water and nutrients we have to come up with solutions soon. Redistribution of wealth and food is vital, but might not be possible in the time available.</p><p>No one is advocating GM as a magic bullet against world hunger, but to reject the contribution of this technology before we even know what it is capable of would be morally wrong. If science can develop nutrient-enriched rice or drought tolerant maize, how can we justify its dismissal on ideological grounds?</p><p>A reliable, sustainable food supply is the common goal of both plant scientists and the green movement; climate change and a growing population are our common concerns. We cannot afford the luxury of fighting over individual technologies such as GM; to succeed we must work together with every tool at our disposal.

Whereas previously countries had been ranked in terms of wealth, the HDR ranked them according to human wellbeing. I have yet to find a better explanation of why GNP is such a limited measure of how a country is doing than the one given by Robert Kennedy, when he was running for president, a few weeks before he was shot:</p><blockquote><p>\"Our gross national product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break them. It counts napalm and the cost of a nuclear warhead, and armoured cars for police who fight riots in our streets. It counts Whitman's rifle and Speck's knife, and the television programmes which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.</p><p>\"Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages; the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.</p><p>\"It measures neither our wit nor our courage; neither our wisdom nor our learning; neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country; it measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it tells us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.\"</p></blockquote><figure data-media-id='gu-image-368368456'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2010/11/4/1288876225582/Graphic-HDI-rankings-001.gif' alt='Graphic: HDI rankings' width='465' height='505' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Human development index rankings</figcaption></figure><p>The HDR tried to rectify some of that, and it is still an eagerly anticipated publication. But it is also true that in recent years it has been losing a bit of its pulling power. There is little to surprise us any more. Norway is always top, and an unfortunate African country (recently Zimbabwe) is always bottom. Even the movements around the Index are not big enough to be very significant given the limitations in the methodology.</p><p>But this year, to mark the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2010/\">20th anniversary of the first report</a>, tucked away unassumingly in chapter five, is a new feature that could again revolutionise our way of assessing progress, and revitalise the HDR's mission. Alongside the regular Human Development Index, the team of researchers has added what they are calling an \"Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index\", or IHDI.</p><p>The HDI measures average wellbeing in a country, but not the disparities between different regions or groups within a country, which are sometimes vast. The IHDI now takes into account how human development is distributed as well. Countries which are very unequal see their human development scores suffer more than those that are less unequal.</p><p>So how does this affect the all-important rankings? In the top 20 countries, movement is limited. Inequality in health, education and income, which are the dimensions of inequality measured in the new Index, is less in countries with \"very high human development\". But there are some things worth noting. The USA moves down nine places, while South Korea, the incredible economic and human development success story of the past half century, also moves down 18 places (from 12th to 30th) in recognition of its high levels of inequality.</p><p>The other big losers are almost all in Latin America, the most unequal region in the world. Panama falls 20 places, Peru 26, Brazil 15, Colombia 18. Venezuela only falls one place, while Nicaragua bucks the trend, rising six places – read into that what you will.</p><p>Which are the countries moving up the scale, to take the places of these falling unequal countries? There is no clear pattern but quite a few of them seem to be from the former soviet block (Armenia, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Uzbekistan).</p><p>Does any of this matter? I think so. One of the main findings of the first 10 years of the MDGs is that inequality matters. More and more people are realising that rising inequality within and between countries is one of the great challenges facing the modern world. Equality matters as an end in itself, and it matters as one of the quickest means to reduce absolute poverty.</p><p>It is very significant that this UN flagship publication is for the first time including inequality in its rankings, tentatively at first, but hopefully it will get bolder in coming years. When the HDI proper fully incorporates an inequality adjustment (ie the IHDI replaces the HDI as the main index), countries will really sit up and listen.</p><p>Governments do care about this index and where they are placed on it. Civil society will use these figures in their battles for a more just world. Crucially, when a country manages to reduce inequality, it moves up the rankings. Brazil has seen its \"HDI losses\" fall between 2000 and 2005 as the country has become a little more equal.</p><p>As with the HDI when it was first launched, the methodology may need some tinkering over time, and the weighting (how much importance you attach to inequality, in a number, which affects overall ranking) will no doubt be adjusted according to what is politically feasible. But the first step has been taken.</p><p>This is not the only innovation in this year's HDR, which also launches indexes in gender inequality and multidimensional poverty, nor the only interesting talking point – the document is full of fascinating analyses that challenge some widely held beliefs.

web behaviour, saying that \"people used to search the web but now browse the graph\" – the Facebook social graph. That's not to overlook the power of search, but indicates how aggressively Facebook is positioning itself at the heart of the internet, as the starting point for the consumer online experience.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-368364492'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/4/1288871330181/browse4nov2010.jpg' alt='Henri Moissinac's presentation explained how Facebook sees the web moving from search to social' width='460' height='251' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Henri Moissinac's presentation explained how Facebook sees the web moving from search to social</figcaption></figure><p> <strong>666 million users:</strong> It's four months since Facebook announced that it had reached <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jul/21/facebook-500-million-users\">500 million active monthly users worldwide</a>, 26 million of whom are in the  UK. Those numbers have undoubtedly increased; mobile has risen from 150 million active monthly users in July to 200 million as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/nov/03/facebook-deals-mobile\">announced by founder</a> Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/pda/2010/jul/20/facebook-500-million\">last night</a>. It's fair to assume, then, that with a similar rate of growth the global user number is now around the deliciously symbolic 666 million. </p><p><strong>Facebook Zero:</strong> Facebook watchers have noted that the company's relatively effortless rise to half a billion users will be much harder to repeat for the next half a billion, with developing markets crucial to that growth. Mobile is key to that, particularly in markets where desktop use is low, such as Africa. Facebook's response to this strategy is Facebook Zero, a simplified, image-free version of the site that users can access for free in some of the markets where Facebook has negotiated a deal with operators. Turkey is seeing strong growth of Facebook Zero because mobile data costs are so high, and is just one country where users are benefitting from Facebook's deals with 300 mobile operators.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rsepulveda/2678498699/\" title=\"Henri Moissinac, Facebook Mobile by rsepulveda, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/2678498699_ea284b0524.jpg\" width=\"460\" alt=\"Henri Moissinac, Facebook Mobile\" /></a><br /><em>Henri Moissinac, Facebook's head of mobile business.

Facebook Zero gives some insight into how the company plans to pursue mobile-orientated growth across the former.</p><p><strong>Developers: </strong>Moissinac described third-party developers' objectives as a combination of distribution, audience engagement and monetisation. Facebook has not done enough so far to help developers make money from their apps on Facebook, he admitted, but is planning to work on that. </p><p>When asked about Facebook's own monetisation plans he insisted it is still very early days, but eMarketer has estimated Facebook's ad revenue for 2010 will be around $1.28bn world – up from $665m in 2009. </p><p><strong>More stats from Moissinac: </strong></p><p>• 50% of Facebook users come back every day<br />• 500,000 apps on Facebook<br />• 250 million users every day<br />• Mobile use is surprisingly 60% through mobile browsers, rather than apps, though 15% is through SMS.<br />• Most active mobile users are in Indonesia, South Africa, Kenya, Canada and the US, where at least 60% of Facebook users spend just as much time on a mobile device as on the desktop.<br />• Look at our data on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/pda/2010/oct/26/facebook-farmville-3\">Three mobile broadband use</a> as one indicator, borne out by Nielsen data on US average time spent online from September this year;  Facebook at 5 hours 25 minutes compared to Yahoo at 2:17 and YouTube at 1:17.</p><p><strong>Startup culture:</strong> What Moissinac also described – when repeatedly asked by the audience  for release dates for an iPad app and various other projects – is how relatively small Facebook still is. It's a risky habit to give fixed release dates for developer projects which can easily slip back. Plus, despite the enormous expectation and  scrutiny of its products and activity, and the now phenomenal reach of  its service, it is still a small company of just 2,000 staff (that's was  Moissinac's guess, though <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/search/fpsearch?companyId=10667&amp;sortCriteria=R&amp;keepFacets=&amp;facet_CC=10667\">LinkedIn</a> says more like 3,000). </p><p>That ever-attractive \"newness\" would explain the influx of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/pda/2010/nov/01/rasmussen-google-facebook\">staff inspired to leave</a> the now goliath Google to join Facebook, on 1601 California Avenue.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2010/nov/04/facebook-mobile-moissinac","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/pda/2010/nov/04/facebook-mobile-moissinac","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Corruption index 2010 from Transparency International: find out how each country compares","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-26T08:00:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2010/oct/26/corruption-index-2010-transparency-international","fields":{"body":"<p>The Corruption Index is always controversial.

href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/2010/oct/25/china-cuts-rare-earths-exports\" title=\"Guardian: China moves to cut mineral supplies\">rare earth elements</a>\" are a group of 17 naturally occurring metallic elements used in small amounts in everything from high-powered magnets to batteries and electronic circuits. The materials (including scandium, yttrium and a group of elements called the lanthanides) have specific chemical and physical properties that make them useful in improving the performance of computer hard drives and catalytic converters, mobile phones, hi-tech televisions, sunglasses and lasers.</p><p>As technology advances, so the demand for the metals rises; in the past decade, their use has doubled. There are several kilograms of such elements in typical hybrid petrol-electric cars made by Toyota and Honda, a market that will expand in coming years.</p><p>Despite their name, rare earth elements are not actually all that rare. In a report on the elements published this year, the British Geological Survey put their natural abundance on the same level as copper or lead.</p><p>China has a near-monopoly on mining the elements. According to the geological survey China has 37% of the world's estimated reserves, about 36m tonnes, but controls more than 97% of production. The former Soviet bloc has around 19m tonnes and the US 13m, with other large deposits held by Australia, India, Brazil and Malaysia.  The <a href=\"http://rsc.org/\">Royal Society of Chemistry</a> is raising awareness of declining mineral resources, making conservation of rare earth and other elements a priority for 2011.</p><p>The US House of Representatives is also worried about security of supply and is considering legislation to try to end America's dependence on Chinese imports. The Mountain Pass mine in California, shut down in 2002 because of environmental and cost issues, is now to be reopened, along with potential mines at Bear Lodge in Wyoming and Bokan Mountain in Alaska..</p><p>Other sources, untapped as yet, include Greenland. Estimates suggest the land mass could meet 25% of global demand for REEs. South Africa also has potential for rich REE deposits, as do Malawi, Madagascar and Kenya.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/25/rare-earth-elements","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/oct/25/rare-earth-elements","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Climate change adaptation remains a dishearteningly familiar story | Eliza Anyangwe","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-18T10:00:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2010/oct/18/climate-change-adaptation-failings","fields":{"body":"<p>At the House of Commons this week, the all-party parliamentary group on climate change gathered to view <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/gallery/2010/oct/12/climate-change-adaptation\">an exhibition</a> showcasing the <a href=\"http://practicalaction.org/cba-workshop-2010\">Community Based Adaptation</a> (CBA) tools developed by the NGO <a href=\"http://practicalaction.org/home\">Practical Action</a> in partnership with the vulnerable communities with whom they work. </p><p>At the community level, climate change impacts upon food and water security, livelihoods and any chance largely pastoral or subsistent farming communities have of working their way out of poverty. The images showed the coalface of climate change work, focusing on places where changes in rainfall pattern are inseparable from wider development issues and poverty. </p><p>The exhibition tells a positive story. It shows how, in Bangladesh, the measures introduced to combat the increasingly destructive monsoon seasons include \"floating gardens\" and the use of ducks as livestock. It also depicts scenes from Kenya, where camels have replaced cattle as severe water shortages and reduced biodiversity make the terrain too difficult for cows.</p><p>But consider the wider context, and the reality is more disheartening.</p><p>The international climate talks in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/copenhagen\">Copenhagen</a> were a disaster in diplomacy and developing country engagement. Self interest and sabotage were the order of the day and, as a result, the world's poorest continue to bear the brunt of climate change effects. As a Practical Action <a href=\"http://practicalaction.org/climate-change/docs/climate_change/adaptation-in-international-negotiations.pdf\">briefing paper</a> on adaptation describes, the rural poor in developing countries are the hardest hit by climate change because they \"are the most reliant on their climate and ecosystems, are the most susceptible and ill-equipped to deal with extreme weather events, and [because they] are already living in poverty\".</p><h2>Financing</h2><p>The lack of political consensus – which precedes financial commitment – is debilitating, says the NGO, which claims that $100bn a year is needed for adaptation alone from 2020 and \"a fair and binding international climate deal\".</p><p>At this time, world leaders have pledged only $1.5bn to finance adaptation and of that a meagre $190m has been given. None of this amount is additional to aid and most of it is funded through the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/\">World Bank</a>, which – as Rachel Berger, Practical Action's climate change adviser, explained at a parliamentary meeting held before the exhibition launch – is distrusted by developing countries for being donor driven. It also funds fossil fuel development.</p><p>However, Andrew Simms of the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/\">New Economics Foundation</a>,  said money wasn't the issue. \"The question is not that there is no money for climate change. That is simply not true. It is just a question of priorities and targeting.\"</p><p>So until adaptation becomes a priority, funding is simply an exercise in creative accounting: a reallocation of existing aid budgets. In the face of broken aid commitments, the prospect of securing additional funding to finance adaptation looks fairly bleak.</p><h2>Joined-up thinking</h2><p>An important concern for all the speakers at the parliamentary meeting was that governments – in both developed and developing countries – are not making important links between: climate change and development; climate change and the geopolitics of water; and climate crisis and economic crisis.</p><p>If the projected future of a world four degrees hotter is accurate, then water and food scarcity and extreme weather events will further exacerbate vulnerability in poor countries, worsening political and economic instability in fragile states and leading to more civil unrest.</p><p>Yet at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Uganda in 2009, climate change was not discussed. According to Chris Tydeman, an independent consultant on European policy, it is expected at least to \"get a mention\" at the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.africa-eu-partnership.org/node/398\">Africa-EU summit</a>. But have those links been made?</p><p>The meeting also heard that joined-up thinking means placing at the centre of planning the people whom mitigation strategies are supposed to help. Parachuting in technology has not delivered development in rural communities, nor is it an effective strategy to dealing with climate change. Rather empowering the community to find their own solutions to the problems they face mean not only that those solutions will be effective and relevant but they will also be sustainable as both the know how to deliver them and the raw materials come from within the community.</p><p>The message from the event was simple: it is time for policy makers to think harder about these communities when they decide to put money towards adaptation. It is indisputable that people in the developing world have started to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/cif-green/2010/oct/12/climate-change-local-action\">do their bit</a> to ensure they are prepared for climate change and to minimise the impact of the damage already done.</p><p>As Practical Action put it: commitments to climate change may stall, but the consequences of inaction will not. The effects are being seen with increasing frequency and ferocity.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2010/10/11/1286802428534/MDG--Photo-Exhibition-Ada-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/oct/18/climate-change-adaptation-failings","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/oct/18/climate-change-adaptation-failings","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Civilian engineering in Africa: the only way is up","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-16T23:06:48Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2010/oct/17/civil-engineering-africa","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 24 2010</strong></p><p>The article below described a Nairobi-made light aircraft that has \"a 40 litre engine and weighs 800kgs\". Most light aircraft weigh about 460kgs. We meant a 4 litre engine, which weighs approximately 308kgs.</p><p> <hr size=\"1\" /> </p><p>Gabriel Nderitu is a 42-year-old IT specialist with no background in aviation engineering, but ever since he was a boy, he wanted to fly. Now he is close to finishing building his own twin-seater aircraft, a feat made all the more remarkable by the fact that he's done so in the backyard of his home in the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya.</p><p>So far, the project has taken 16 months of his time and cost him 450,000 Kenyan shillings (£3,500) from his savings. The plane has a 74in propeller and a 40-litre Toyota engine and weighs 800kg. The strutted wing and ailerons are skinned with aluminium sheets. To help with the welding and the assembly, Nderitu hired five mechanics.</p><p>How did he know what to do? Nderitu spent six months researching the subject online, downloading blueprints. Some parts he ordered from the US. \"It's a boyhood dream,\" he told Kenyan TV. \"I just want to get it out, whether it works or not. If it gets out of my mind then I can do something else.\"</p><p>Such ingenuity is far from atypical in Africa. As the blog <a href=\"http://www.afrigadget.com/\" title=\"AfriGadget\">AfriGadget</a> points out, Nderitu is not the first African to try building his own aircraft. Physics graduate Mubarak Muhammad Abdullahi, 24, from north Nigeria, recently built <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hV0rzEDq7TWnlm7tMmr2zeQmiRig\" title=\"\">a working helicopter using scrap aluminium and parts from a Honda Civic, an old Toyota and a crashed Boeing 747</a>. This inventor had no formal training in aviation, either, but his helicopter flew, if only ever seven feet off the ground.</p><p>There have been reports, too, of three&nbsp;Somali men constructing a homemade&nbsp;chopper.</p><p>The AfriGadget site is filled with examples of similarly inspired inventions: a customised bicycle with a dynamo that can charge a mobile phone, for example, or a contraption to extract biogas from cow dung. The idea is to showcase Africans \"bending the little they have to their will, using creativity to overcome life's challenges\". The site's founder, Erik Hersman, grew up in Kenya and Sudan and also co-founded <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a>, a crowdsourcing tool that allowed Kenyans to track the violence that followed the 2008 elections and which has since been used in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gaza.</p><p>As for Gabriel Nderitu, there is no guarantee that his aircraft will be allowed to fly, or that it is even capable of full flight. But that little matters. \"If a guy says 'I want to build an aircraft' it seems like he's from the moon, or from somewhere,\" he told the Kenyan media. \"And if it happens, if it at least lifts off, even if it is three feet, it shows that you have gone somewhere.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/14/1287076803440/Mubarak-Muhammad-Abdullah-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/oct/17/civil-engineering-africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2010/oct/17/civil-engineering-africa","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Global hunger index: see how the world compares. Spreadsheet and visualised","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-11T12:18:15Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/datablog/2010/oct/11/global-hunger-index","fields":{"body":"<p>Is global hunger getting worse? According to the <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/publication/2010-global-hunger-index\">2010 Global Hunger Index</a> (GHI), published by the <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org\">International Food Policy Research Institute (</a>IFPRI), in many countries nothing has changed over the last decade. </p><p>The GHI scores countries on three equally weighted indicators: the proportion of people who are undernourished, the proportion of children under five who are underweight, and the child mortality rate.  The biggest contributor to the global figure is child undernutrition, which accounts for almost half of the score.</p><p>The Index is calculated for 122 developing and transition countries for which data on the three components of hunger are available. Twenty-nine countries have levels of hunger that are \"extremely alarming\" or \"alarming.\" Most of these are in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</p><p>Pregnancy and the first two years of life provide a vital \"window of opportunity\" to prevent future health problems among children, said the report, which is also produced by NGOs Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. It added that undernourishment during these two years can cause irreversible, long-term damage.</p><p>\"The high prevalence of child under-nutrition is a major contributor to persistent hunger,\" said the report.</p><p>Marie Ruel, director of IFPRI's poverty, health and nutrition division and co-author of the report, said: \"To improve their scores, many countries must accelerate progress in reducing child malnutrition. Considerable research shows that the window of opportunity for improving nutrition spans from conception to age two. After age two, the negative effects of under-nutrition are largely irreversible.\"</p><p>The chair of the German NGO Welthungerhilfe, Bärbel Dieckmann, added: \"The health of women, specifically mothers, is crucial to reducing child malnutrition. Mothers who were poorly nourished as girls tend to give birth to underweight babies, perpetuating the cycle of under-nutrition.</p><p>\"Nutrition interventions should be targeted towards girls and women throughout the life cycle and especially as adolescents before they become pregnant.\"</p><p>The report notes that – despite gains in reducing hunger and undernourishment over the last 20 years, with hunger levels falling by one quarter – the number of hungry people has recently begun to rise. The report defines world hunger levels as \"serious\". It notes that the recent spike in food prices pushed the number of undernourished people beyond one billion, although estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the UN suggest the number will drop this year.</p><p>Eight of the nine countries in which hunger levels rose were found in Africa. These include Liberia, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Burundi and DRC had \"extremely alarming\" hunger levels, along with Eritrea and Chad. North Korea was the only country outside Africa to show an increase in hunger levels, which has been blamed on negative trends in economic growth and food production.</p><p>Other key findings are:</p><p>• In South Asia, low nutritional, educational, and social status of women is among the major factors that contribute to a high prevalence of malnutrition in children under five<br />• In some countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, for example Burundi, Madagascar, and Malawi, about half of the children are stunted (low height for age) due to poor nutrition<br />• The burden of child undernutrition could be cut by 25-36 percent by providing universal preventive health services and nutrition interventions for children under two and their mothers during pregnancy and lactation. </p><p>IFPRI have provided us with the key data as a spreadsheet for you to download and play with.

As a result, the company's principle environmental concerns are changing weather patterns, water-scarcity and unsustainable farming practices.<br />•\tUnilever measures its product categories against four green indicators covering water, waste, sustainable sourcing and greenhouse gas emissions.<br />•\tMost CO2 emissions associated with Unilever brands occur during consumer use as products require energy to heat water for cooking and washing.</p><h2>Targets &amp; Performance</h2><p><strong><br />Emissions &amp; Energy</strong></p><p>•\tThe company's aim is to reduce the carbon intensity of manufacturing operations by 25% by 2012 (measured as tonnes CO2 per tonne of production against a 2004 baseline).<br />•\tIn 2008, the company reduced CO2 emissions by 1.6% per tonne of production compared to 2007.<br />•\tUnilever has reduced the carbon intensity of its energy use by 39% between 1995 and 2008. This represents a 43% reduction in absolute terms.<br />•\tThe company is investing in more efficient power and steam generation technology and the development of less energy intensive manufacturing processes. For example:<br />-\tIn Europe, Unilever has at least three CHP plants which use waste steam and hot water to generate electricity.<br />-\tThe Cu Chi factory in Vietnam uses solar panels to preheat water for steam generation.<br />-\t2m point-of-sale ice cream freezer cabinets are being replaced with energy-efficient HC alternatives.<br />•\tThe company plans to reduce indirect impacts by working with customers and suppliers to address wider impacts. For example, Ben &amp; Jerry's has a Lick Global Warming campaign and an ice cream flavour called Fossil Fuel.<br />•\tAround 4m tonnes of CO2 are produced each year because of Unilever's transport and product distribution requirements.</p><p><strong>Water</strong></p><p>•\tUnilever relies on water for:<br />-\tSourcing: the cultivation of agricultural raw materials<br />-\tManufacturing operations: cleaning, cooling, as an ingredient<br />-\tConsumers: use of home care and personal products<br />•\tUnilever aims to:<br />-\tReduce water in manufacturing<br />-\tWork with suppliers on issues such as crop irrigation<br />-\tInnovation on product design<br />•\tSince 1995, Unilever has reduced the amount of water used per tonne of production by 63% by minimising water use and maximising water recycling.<br />•\tDuring 2008, there was a 3% reduction in water intensity compared to 2007 – from 3.05 m3 to 2.96 m3 per tonne of production. <br />•\tThe water intensity of food production has dropped from 5.27 m3 in 2003 to 4.23 m3 in 2007 per tonne of production.<br />•\tProducts aimed at reduced consumer water consumption include the One Rinse Comfort fabric conditioner. In Vietnam, One Rinse Comfort reduces the water needed by two-thirds and sales rose by nearly 30% in 2008.<br /><strong><br />Waste</strong></p><p>•\tWaste intensity has reduced by 68% per tonnes of production between 1995 and 2008, despite a 4.3% increase in the last year (7.56 kg/tonnes in 2007 to 7.89 kg/tonne).<br />•\tThe company says this increase was due to:<br />-\tLegislative changes<br />-\tUnder-capacity in effluent treatment<br />-\tPlanned disposal of accumulated and inherited hazardous waste<br />•\tChanging packaging design is one of the ways in which the company wants to use to reduce waste impacts.<br />•\tThe PVC policy commits to replacing PVC in all packaging by the end of 2010, where there are viable alternatives.</p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>•\tAgricultural and forestry crops make up around half by volume of raw materials used by Unilever.<br />•\tUnilever buys approximately 12% of the world's black tea, 6% of the world's tomatoes and 3% of its palm oil.<br />•\tUnilever established guidelines for good agricultural practice based on 11 indicators including water, energy, pesticide use and animal welfare. Growers and third-party suppliers are encouraged to comply.<br />•\tMost of the world's oil palm is grown in South-East Asia where the clearance and burning of forests contributes to global warming.<br />•\tFollowing a public challenge by Greenpeace, Unilever has agreed to draw all their palm oil from certified sustainable sources by 2015.<br />•\tUnilever have also agreed to support a moratorium on further deforestation in South-East Asia.<br />•\tAt the end of 2009 around 80% of Lipton Yellow Label and PG tips tea sold in Western Europe came from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms.<br />•\tUnilever also uses paper and board, plastic, glass, aluminium, steel and mixed material laminates (for sachets and pouches) in its manufacturing processes.</p><h2><br />Relationships</h2><p>•\tFounding member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which it continues to chair.<br />•\tWorked with Greenpeace to build a global coalition of companies, banks and NGOs to break the link between deforestation and the cultivation of oil palm.<br />•\tUnilever worked alongside Tesco to persuade the Consumer Goods Forum, a global alliance of 300 leading manufacturers and retailers, to work together to end deforestation.<br />•\tWorking with Greenpeace on climate-friendly refrigerants in an alliance called Refrigerants Naturally!<br />•\tFounding members of the Carbon Disclosure Project's Supply Chain Leadership Collaboration.<br />•       CEO Paul Polman co-chairs a sustainability steering group of The Consumer Goods Forum with Sir Terry Leahy. They have set out the vision for the sustainability programme to drive and communicate sustainability improvements throughout the value chain of the consumer goods industry.<br />•\tParticipated in a 2008 event hosted by Wal-Mart on water stewardship, sharing expertise on reducing water use at all steps of a product lifecycle.<br />•\tParticipated in an initiative with Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA), the UK Department for International Development and Wageningen University to train smallholder farmers in sustainable tea cultivation.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/profile-unilever","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/profile-unilever","sectionName":"Global"},{"webTitle":"Nobel peace prize winners list 2010: how does Liu Xiaobo compare to previous medal holders?","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-08T10:41:56Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2010/oct/08/nobel-peace-prize-winners-list-liu-xiaobo","fields":{"body":"<p>The Nobel Peace Prize for 2010 has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/08/nobel-peace-prize-liu-xiaobo\">gone to China's best-known dissident, Liu Xiaobo</a> — who is presently in a prison cell where he is serving 11 years for incitement to subvert state power.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-380061718'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/10/9/1255086910080/Nobel-Peace-Prize-medal-001.jpg' alt='Nobel Peace Prize medal' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nobel Prize winners get this medal Photograph: Ted Spiegel/© Ted Spiegel/CORBIS</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2010/\">Norwegian Nobel committee</a> praised Liu Xiaobo for his \"long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.

A number of Chinese dissidents signed a letter in support of Liu Xiaobo. In an <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/en/pa/why-nobel-peace-prize-should-go-liu-xiaobo-analysis-498270\">article backing him for the prize, the philosopher Xu Youyu wrote</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>His activities in 1989 can be seen as formative in the entirety of his following writings and other works, characterised by an unwavering bravery and refusal to back down in the face of danger and suppression, by the pursuit and defence of human rights, humanism, peace and other universal values and, finally, adherence to the practice of rational dialogue, compromise and non-violence</p></blockquote><p>That's a long tradition. There have been 120 Nobel Peace Prize winners since 1901 - many of the prizes have been shared, such as that between Israeli leader Menachem Begin and Egypt's Mohamed Anwar Al-Sadat in 1978 or Frederik Willem De Klerk and Nelson Mandela's in 1993.</p><p>We have produced a breakdown of winners - which you can see in the graphic above. The top lines of it are:</p><blockquote><p>• 23 of the 120 have been won by institutions<br />• The US has produced the most winners - 28 so far, including Barack Obama last year. It's followed by the the UK with 15<br />• This is China's first Nobel Peace Prize<br />• The vast majority of winners are men</p></blockquote><p>Last year we made some <a

broadband internet establish a new development trajectory for east Africa? | Mark Graham","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-07T10:00:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2010/oct/07/rwanda-kenya-broadband-internet-investment","fields":{"body":"<p>Six young software developers start the morning with a team meeting about implementing cloud computing solutions for an international client. This isn't Silicon Valley, Seoul or Bangalore. It's Kigali, Rwanda. </p><p>East Africa is in the process of reinventing itself. The government of Rwanda has invested heavily in IT infrastructure to bring high speed internet connections to even the most remote parts of this small, resource-poor country. Kenya, similarly, has ambitious plans to become a highly wired nation and attract a share of the growing market in international business outsourcing.</p><p>Only a year ago, east Africa was the last major region on Earth without fibre-optic broadband internet connections. People were forced to rely on painfully slow and prohibitively expensive satellite connections. However, the recent arrival of three submarine fibre-optic cables into the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa has now fundamentally altered the connectivity of the region.</p><p>Bitange Ndemo, Kenya's permanent secretary for information and communications, compares the landing of these cables to a virus that has infected the region. \"In the next five years there will be a full blown status of the virus,\" he says. \"It has to kill something. It will kill the current inefficient systems, it will kill the corruption we have, and it will create completely new systems. In my view, the IT industry is the leading system that will be created.\"</p><p>Ignace Gatare, Rwanda's minister of information communication technology (ICT), similarly remarked: \"People were saying: 'Rwanda you are dreaming. How can you invest [millions of] dollars when you are still an agricultural nation?' I would respond that we cannot forget agriculture, but we cannot afford to be disconnected from the digital global economy.\"</p><p>I spent the last five weeks in both countries, interviewing software developers, web designers, call centre managers and government officials. Among all those groups, similar opinions were echoed by almost everyone I spoke to. The sense of anticipation and expectation is palpable.</p><p>A commonly expressed sentiment is that the cables have fundamentally altered the relative distance between east Africa and the rest of the world. For instance, Anthony Nguru, a Nairobi-based software developer, said: \"Without fast internet, you are landlocked. You can only do small projects around here.\" With the arrival of the cables, there is a general sense among east African businesses that they can work with clients anywhere in the world, unconstrained by traditional barriers. </p><p>IT businesses in Kenya and Rwanda are eager to take advantage of this newfound connectivity and reach out to international customers. However, the fragility of the technological fix on which these companies are relying is often painfully apparent. Both countries have suffered multiple internet outages in the last few months due to vandalism, technical faults and an explosion in Uganda that severed the main internet connection into Kigali. </p><p>Older infrastructure problems will also undoubtedly continue to plague the development of the industry. At the opening session of the recent east Africa ICT summit, a keynote speaker was discussing how faster internet speeds would transform the region when one of Nairobi's frequent power cuts interrupted his talk. The irony of the situation was not lost on the audience. </p><p>Nobody knows whether the East African gamble on IT and outsourcing will pay off. Vast resources have been invested, and there are high hopes among many in the public and private sectors that changes in connectivity offer opportunities for economic growth. But important questions remain. Will altered connectivity really allow firms in east Africa to become hubs in the global economy? Or will improved connections simply allow foreign firms to better exploit the demand in east Africa for IT services? Perhaps most importantly, who stands to benefit? And who will be left out of these transformations? </p><p>The answers to these questions are unclear. But it is likely that the sense of expectation and change in Kenya and Rwanda will be enough to bring about significant economic transformations, whatever they may be. </p><p><em>Mark Graham is a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, which is part of the University of Oxford.

Others disappear without trace. But some go on to do something extraordinarily different. When the Stooges' early-1970s lineup reformed in 2009, the most curious aspect wasn't the return of a band whose last gig,&nbsp;in 1974, had ended in a hail of bottles and eggs, but the revelation that long-lost guitarist James Williamson had spent the&nbsp;intervening years as vice-president of&nbsp;technology standards for Sony. Similarly, Pentagon officials must be bemused to consult US missile defence systems analyst Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter and&nbsp;discover that he had a previous life as&nbsp;guitarist in AOR supergroups Steely Dan&nbsp;and the Doobie Brothers. But what compels or enables pop stars to make such&nbsp;unlikely career shifts? And is a pop past a help or a hindrance? We talk to those&nbsp;who know.</p><h2><strong>David Rowntree</strong><br /><strong>Then: Blur drummer</strong><br /><strong>Now:<em> </em>Lawyer</strong><br /></h2><p>I was never just the drummer in Blur – I always had something else going on, such as my work as an animator. Once when talking to some lawyer friends, asking them what their life was like, one of them&nbsp;suggested I should hang out at the Old Bailey. So I did, for two weeks. One of&nbsp;the court staff mistook me for Chris Evans. I shadowed a solicitor at a friend's criminal law firm – going to prisons and police stations – and absolutely loved it. It was a whole other world. I worked there while I was doing my legal training, representing people when they'd been arrested, being&nbsp;called out at 2am. It's incredibly difficult and often the whole case rests on&nbsp;what happens at the police&nbsp;station. I ended up back at the Old Bailey as a solicitor's representative working on a murder trial, one&nbsp;of the most&nbsp;fantastic times of my life. It meant something: somebody's life was on the line. I'm not sure the client knew I was the&nbsp;drummer from Blur, but I don't think they could have cared less: they're on trial for murder.&nbsp;They're not gonna care if it's bloody Mick Jagger.</p><h2><strong>Rev Richard Coles</strong><br /><strong>Then: Keyboard player for 80s hitmakers the Communards</strong><br /><strong>Now: Curate of St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge</strong><br /></h2><p>We were the first generation of pop bands to come through for whom being gay didn't feel like an issue, but of course it was. I remember a Daily Telegraph leader which said: \"The problem with Aids is it's not confined to homosexuals.\" It's a different world now, and it would be flattering to feel we contributed in some way. I did all the things that pop stars do. If you give someone aged 25 a lot of money&nbsp;and feed their ego, they behave extraordinarily badly. Your friends are on the dole and suddenly you're doing the Montreux pop festival or messing about with Roland Rat. People are always pleased to see you and tell you that you're marvellous. You get used to that in 30 seconds, but&nbsp;coming down from that takes much longer. The end of the band coincided with&nbsp;a very dark time: suddenly people around me were getting terribly ill [with Aids] and&nbsp;dying in their 20s. If you've encountered turbulence, maybe you yearn for a safe harbour.</p><p>I was a chorister when I was a kid, so I had breathed the atmosphere. But I'd always thought religion was all wicked nonsense. Suddenly I found myself attending church. I discovered that I needed it, as a human being. I'd done some&nbsp;broadcasting, where the fact that I'd been a pop star, wore glasses and played piano seemed to make people think I was a&nbsp;towering intellectual, but aged 30 I went to university to study theology, and eventually I got through selection as a priest. I actually think my pop past helps me all the time: you're performing all the time, the hours are long, people look at you&nbsp;funny, you dress up, and there's music. It's actually not dissimilar.</p><h2><strong>Louise Wener</strong><br /><strong>Then: Singer with Britpop band Sleeper</strong><br /><strong>Now: Author</strong><br /></h2><p>I actually wanted to write books first, but then music came along. I'd wanted to be in a band for so long but the rise and fall was disconcertingly swift. When the band split, I went through something like a grieving process. Outside the band, I wasn't sure who I was. I worked on a solo album but my heart wasn't in it. I'd bought a secondhand electric typewriter and I used to tap away at the back of the recording studio, trying to wring out the beginnings of a novel. I wrote about 80,000 words, junked them and started again. And then I got excited because I thought I might have something worth showing to someone else. I sent the first three chapters of my first book to random agents. I'm sure the fact that I'd been in Sleeper meant my manuscript was plucked off the slush pile and read, but I felt very self-conscious about only being signed on the back of past glories. Writing requires more discipline than a three-minute pop song, but you don't have to fight with the band, the record company. Every time I see a great gig I want to get the band back together, but the feeling is fleeting. I'm much happier with the anonymity of writing. I think fame is a form of madness.</p><h2><strong>Terry Chimes</strong><br /><strong>Then: Drummer on the first Clash album</strong><br /><strong>Now: Chiropractor </strong><br /></h2><p>As a kid, I preferred a microscope to a football for Christmas, but I got distracted by music and the option of joining the Clash seemed more fun than medical school. The punk scene was more about boozing than drugs, but I saw people deteriorating before my eyes and grew fed&nbsp;up with the arguments. I played with the Clash a second time when Topper Headon's drug use became a problem. Then, after the Clash, I played for Black Sabbath and Billy Idol. Once I was in Sun City with Black Sabbath and we went ten-pin bowling. After three hours, my shoulder locked up. They said they would find a chiropractor. This guy came in, cracked all my joints and I could move my arm again. It made a big impression.</p><p>I'd always known I wanted to heal people, so I enrolled on a chiropractic course in Bournemouth and didn't tell anyone who I was. But shortly afterwards they rereleased Should I Stay Or Should I&nbsp;Go. It was No 1 for three weeks, and of course, I'm in the video, so the secret was&nbsp;out.</p><p>Drums are the most hands-on instruments; chiropractic is the most hands-on medicine. You're manipulating people's spines. Mick Jones and Paul Simonon [from the Clash] have sent musicians to me for treatment, and I get some Clash fans.</p><p>There have been some funny moments. Once I was sitting in the car and the mobile went and this voice said: \"Is that Terry Chimes Chiropractic? Terry Chimes who used to be in the Clash? This is the singer.\" It was Joe Strummer.</p><h2><strong>Peter Wishart</strong><br /><strong>Then: Guitarist in Scottish rockers Runrig</strong><br /><strong>Now: Scottish Nationalist party MP for Perth and North Perthshire</strong></h2><p>Before Runrig, I was in Big Country for a while, and we supported Alice Cooper when he had a snake onstage. I had a phobia and spent the whole time terrified of the snake. Eventually we were booted off the tour when the denim-clad metal kids booed our heartfelt Celtic anthems.</p><p>Runrig were a political band, which suited me as I had a strong trades-union and student politics background. Where other bands discussed sex and drugs, Runrig debated the Scottish constitutional question. When our former singer Donnie Munro stood for election in the late 90s and almost succeeded, the SNP leader Alex Salmond encouraged me to have a go. I knew entering politics would mean leaving the band, but I was approaching 40 and was ready for a new challenge.</p><p>I was elected in 2001, although I still play in parliamentary rock band MP4. People often say politics is show business for ugly people, and there is a lot in that statement: there is the rehearsing, preparation and performance, and you're dealing with the media. When I first stood&nbsp;for election there was quite a fuss&nbsp;because I'd been on Top of the Pops five times, but constituents just want you to do a good job.</p><h2><strong>Andrea Lewis</strong><br /><strong>Then: Singer with the Darling Buds </strong><br /><strong>Now: Runs children's theatre schools</strong><br /></h2><p>The music thing all happened so quickly. I was only 19, and from the moment John Peel played us it went mad. We were pigeonholed with Transvision Vamp and the Primitives as blonde-fronted bands. We had some success, but Harley [Farr] the main songwriter and I went out together then split up while the band was still going. We fell out with our management and couldn't go on tour. I closed the door and never revisited it. It left a bad taste for 10 years. Aged 29 I went to drama school. I joined a theatre company and toured Europe. I had a radio show on BBC Wales and had children. Now I run children's theatre schools in Cardiff and Newport for 200 children. I've learned to trust my instincts. You get a lot of people saying to the kids: \"You're going to be the next X Factor.\" I tell them my experiences, to put things into perspective. Last month we played a reunion gig for a friend of ours who passed away. We've all got kids now, and it wasn't half as painful as I expected, although Harley didn't want to do it. He's a nutritionist now.</p><h2><strong>Robert Dean</strong><br /><strong>Then: guitarist in new romantic pioneers Japan</strong><br /><strong>Now: Illustrator of ornithology books</strong><br /></h2><p>Being in Japan in the late 1970s was an exciting time. But by the time the band were listening to Ryuichi Sakamoto and Yellow Magic Orchestra and actually thinking of moving to Japan, there wasn't much room for my guitar. I played with ABC and Gary Numan, and played with my&nbsp;own band in Australia, but I'd never really had a holiday. So I went to Peru and Bolivia and loved it; I went backpacking in South America, and eventually settled in Costa Rica.</p><p>As a kid I'd always been into wildlife, and&nbsp;in Costa Rica there's so much natural beauty. I started watching and then painting the birdlife, and now I illustrate and write books documenting it. I love it here and don't miss my past life. But it's funny, even out here you can never quite escape: I play in a local band, and sometimes&nbsp;people come up and say, \"Weren't you in ...?\" I seem to be seen as a major expert on South American birdlife  now, although I'm not sure how that happened. I just made a conscious effort to change my&nbsp;life.</p><h2><strong>Mike Edwards</strong><br /><strong>Then: Leader of indie dance hitmakers Jesus Jones</strong><br /><strong>Now: Personal trainer</strong><br /></h2><p>I decided early on that being cardiovascularly fit would prevent me losing my voice onstage. I got into cycling, which became a good method of transport in London when we were famous because you could get where you wanted without people on the tube going \"I saw your interview this week.\" Cycling became such an obsession that I started racing. But&nbsp;as the band's career went down the tubes, I wondered what I'd ever do should Americans ever stop playing Right Here, Right Now, and remembered Mick Jagger saying that apart from music he was unemployable. I came across an advert asking \"Have you ever fancied a career in fitness?\" and I did. I enrolled on courses, I had clients. I now run a personal training business with a couple of trainers under my wing. The band thought I was nuts, but&nbsp;I was always the least rock'n'roll in the group. I use music a lot in classes but never&nbsp;Jesus Jones: it was a separate life. But being a pop star has helped. When I was first qualifying, the people around me&nbsp;were absolutely terrified, but after playing to 72,000 people at Wembley Stadium, doing exercises in front of 10 people was nothing.</p><h2><strong>David Emmanuel </strong><br /><strong>Then: Early-80s reggae MC Smiley Culture</strong><br /><strong>Now: Diamond mine manager</strong><br /></h2><p>My hit single Police Officer was a true story&nbsp;– the police used to take my weed. It was better than being arrested, and I made that into a hit. With Cockney Translation I was a black man talking cockney. I integrated cultures even though I didn't understand it at the time. I was invited to meet the Queen, who said she listened to my records in the palace. Although I paved&nbsp;the&nbsp;way for people like the Streets and Dizzee Rascal, I left the music business because I wasn't rich. I first became aware&nbsp;of the possibilities for mining after visiting Grenada, where my mother comes from. Cockney Translation had endeared me to a lot of serious businessmen in the East End of London, and because of the&nbsp;records,&nbsp;I'd met a lot of influential people who helped me get investment. At school I thought diamonds came from vaults: now&nbsp;I've got gold and diamond mine concessions in Ghana, Uganda, Liberia, Kenya and the Congo, and I'm promoting a record for the Azerbaijan government. Recently, I bought an expensive car in cash, which resulted in a visit by the police. It was like Police Officer all over again.</p><h2>Amelia Fletcher<br />Then: Singer with indiepop bands Talulah Gosh and Heavenly<br />Now: Chief economist and director of mergers at the Office of Fair Trading<br /></h2><p>I basically carried on my education so I&nbsp;could keep doing the band. I was studying philosophy and economics at&nbsp;Oxford when I was in Talulah Gosh and&nbsp;can remember asking for quiet rooms so I could do essays after soundchecks. Heavenly were even more academic: several of us got firsts. I did a masters, then a doctorate and by the end I was hugely overqualified. At that point I didn't think that I wanted to be an economist, but the qualifications I had pretty much meant&nbsp;I had to become one. I started in consultancy part-time, but then I got really into it. I don't think any of us quite believed in the band enough to give up our jobs and go for it. My work&nbsp;is quite serious, but my bands are&nbsp;fun. I tried to keep my background quiet because I thought it might compromise my gravitas, but a few people found out. Now I play in Tender Trap, and we were up for the 6Music votes-based playlist; I bit the bullet and emailed people at work and&nbsp;asked them to vote for us. Whenever the OFT gets involved in music – such as the planned merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster – I have to withdraw because I might have a conflict of interest. It's funny, because it's the one subject I might know something about.</p><h2>Peter Momtchiloff<br />Then: Guitarist in Talulah Gosh and Heavenly<br />Now: Senior commissioning editor at the Oxford University Press<br /></h2><p>I was never that career-minded, in music or anything else. Like most of my friends at Oxford, I'd just coast along. You didn't come out of university in debt like you do now. I got by on the dole and then I got a job in a record shop, where I met Amelia, and we formed the band. I did some freelance copy editing from home for two years so I could do music and go on tour. Eventually I joined the Oxford University Press as a desk editor and worked my way up. Now I publish philosophy books – talking to potential authors and working out who would be good to publish. I've been called \"the world's most influential voice in philosophy publishing\" in the Economist, but it was probably one of my friends who said that. I do publish more philosophy books than anyone else, but I have to take expert advice from philosophers on whether the stuff is good. I still play in bands, so in a way nothing changed. The weird thing about talking to philosophers is you expect them to be super-highbrow, but many of them are my generation, and a lot are indie music fans and nerds. I've been in the middle of the US talking to a philosopher, and they've suddenly gone all sheepish and said: \"I probably shouldn't tell you this, but I've got all your records.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/9/21/1285085292388/THE-MIDEM-POP-FESTIVAL-CA-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/23/pop-stars-musicians-jobs-careers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/2010/sep/23/pop-stars-musicians-jobs-careers","sectionName":"Music"},{"webTitle":"The millennium development goals and the gender gap","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-22T14:11:01Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"news/datablog/2010/sep/22/millennium-development-goals-gender-gap","fields":{"body":"<p>A common criticism of the Millennium Development Goals is that they are not political enough. Actually, there are good reasons for that, such as the need to get buy-in from a very diverse set of countries and politicians. But one area of the MDGs is highly political: gender equality. Perhaps that is why, as a new <a href=\"http://www.unifem.org/progress/\">UNIFEM report</a> published this week insists, progress on the gender equality dimensions of the MDGs is slower than on other aspects. </p><p>Importantly, there are some areas where we need to look behind the statistics to see what is really happening. Take education. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?facet_goal=goal-3-promote-gender-equality-and-empower-women\">MDG3</a> calls, among other things, for gender parity in education (primary, secondary and tertiary). Well the data in a recent <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_55740.html\">UNICEF report</a> appears to be very promising. It shows that while girls are still disadvantaged in primary school enrolment in developing countries (although they are catching up), boys tend to be the ones going less to secondary school in most regions, and particularly in Latin America. It appears to be the case in a number of southern African countries as well. And in Mongolia.</p><p>So I was interested by what Laura Turquet, lead author of this year's UNIFEM report, Progress of the World's Women, told me about this:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>You're right that there are quite a few countries where gender parity has been reached for secondary school attendance, but in sub-Saharan Africa at least, generally at very low rates overall. So for example, in Kenya parity has been reached, but only around 10% of all children go to secondary school. So while gender parity is important, if girls are matching boys but at a very low level overall, much more needs to be done. Secondary education has enormous intrinsic value, but it is also especially important for girls because it enables them to access jobs, lowers their chance of getting HIV and gives them more of a say in decisions within the household.</p><p>If you then break the figures down by location and poverty, you find that while around a quarter of rich urban girls in Kenya go to secondary school, less than 5% of poor rural girls do. In Colombia, parity has been reached at around 67%, but only 40% of poor rural girls are attending secondary school. So we need to pay attention not only to averages, but also to how poor girls and those in rural areas are faring.</p></blockquote><p>As always, we need to get well behind the statistics to really understand what is going on. Even more worrying are disparities in child mortality in different countries. You may not know (I didn't) that under-five mortality (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?facet_goal=goal-4-reduce-child-mortality\">MDG4</a>) tends to be higher among boys than girls, reflecting \"biological and genetic advantages\" of females in the first year of life, and possibly beyond. No surprise then that, globally, more girls survive to their fifth birthday than boys, according to <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_55740.html\">UNICEF data</a>. </p><p>However, China and India buck this trend, with boys surviving more than girls. While UNICEF carefully avoids comment, this is clearly a reflection of the social pressures in those countries to favour boys. It is an issue raised some time ago by Amartya Sen, who documented Asia's 'missing women', estimating that there are 100 million fewer women and girls than there should be, as a result of sex selective abortion, maternal mortality, violence against women and girls and other forms of gender discrimination.</p><p>An <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/index.asp?page_id=101347\">ActionAid report</a> found that sex selective abortion in some of the richer states of Northern India is creating ratios of just 300 girls for every 1000 boys, which is staggering. While in poorer families, the issue tends to be neglect of girls and sometimes infanticide, the problem is most pronounced among richer families, who can afford to find out the sex of their foetus and pay for an abortion. It is against the law in India to tell expectant parents the sex of their foetus, but the law is widely flouted. </p><p>For some, gender inequality is about breaking the glass ceiling, but for millions of women and girls it's a matter of life and death.</p><p><a name=\"data\"></p><h2>Download the data</h2><p></a></p><p>• <a

With the 2015 target date looming some are looking more achievable than others.</p><p>Here we take a closer look at three of the goals for a taste of what has been achieved so far, and what is left to accomplish.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=&amp;facet_goal=goal-1-eradicate-extreme-poverty-and-hunger\">MDG 1</a>, end poverty and hunger, looks like one of the most achievable, despite the World Bank's prediction that as a result of the global economic crisis 53 million more people will remain in extreme poverty by 2015 than otherwise would have. </p><p>There have been some remarkable success stories.  Ghana has reduced hunger by three quarters, from 34% in 1991 to 8% in 2005, and in Ethiopia the percentage of the population that was undernourished fell from 71% in 1991 to 46% in 2005.  In stark contrast is the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the percentage of the population going hungry increased from 29% to 75% over the same time period.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=&amp;facet_goal=goal-2-achieve-universal-primary-education\">MDG 2</a>, achieve universal primary education, is looking increasingly unlikely.  However, in terms of enrolment in, as opposed to completion of, primary school education there have been some real improvements.  Take, for example, Tanzania where the number of children starting primary school has risen from 50.7% to 99.6% since 1991; or Mali which saw a massive leap from 23.4% to 74.7%.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=&amp;facet_goal=goal-4-reduce-child-mortality\">MDG 4</a>, to reduce the under five mortality rate by two thirds, looks certain to fail.  By 2007 the rate had only dropped by a third.  However there have been vast improvements in some countries.  Vietnam saw the number of children dying before their fifth birthday drop from 56 in every 1000 (1990) to 14 (2008); Turkey has dropped their rate from 84 to 22 and Peru's fell from 81 to 24.  In contrast Kenya saw its child mortality rate increase from 105 to 128 per 1000.</p><h2>Download the data</h2><p>• <a href=\"https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AjuKrzV2yCOLdHlRZzRKbFJPZXIzLTdzTWc5UHlBLUE&amp;hl=en\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a></p><h2>Development and aid data</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's development and aid data with our gateway</a></p><h2>World government data</h2><p>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government with our gateway</a></p><h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2><p><strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a> or mail us at <a href=\"mailto:datastore@guardian.co.uk\">datastore@guardian.co.uk</a></p><p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br /><strong>• <a href=\"http://twitter.com/datastore\">Follow us on Twitter</a></strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/9/20/1284995879620/Ban-Ki-moon-speaks-during-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/sep/20/millennium-development-goals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/news/datablog/2010/sep/20/millennium-development-goals","sectionName":"News"},{"webTitle":"Child mortality: how the data shows it isn't dropping fast enough","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-17T14:51:15Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/datablog/2010/sep/17/development-data-aid","fields":{"body":"<p>One of the plethora of reports about the MDGs being published at the moment is a rather good one by UNICEF called <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_55740.html\">Progress for Children: Achieving the MDGs with Equity</a>. Its comprehensive data demonstrates the danger, in the words of UNICEF's policy director Richard Morgan, of a \"statistical victory, but a moral failure.\" In other words, while the world might meet some of the numerical targets set out 10 years ago, when you like behind the numbers, the picture is less rosy. </p><p>Take <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?facet_goal=goal-4-reduce-child-mortality\">MDG4</a>, whose headline target is to reduce child mortality by two-thirds. While great improvements have been made in child health, the world is leaving the poorest children behind. Inequality in child mortality, as in almost all other areas of human life, is increasing in our era.<br /> <br />The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?facet_goal=goal-4-reduce-child-mortality\">global under-five mortality rate</a> has reduced from 90 per 1000 in 1990 to 65 in 2008. That is significant progress. It shows that determined effort combined with economic advance can produce results. The figures on measles related deaths are the most dramatic, with a reduction of 92% in sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2008. </p><p>But then comes the bad news. In 10 of the 26 developing countries with a significant decline in under-five mortality, the gap in under-five mortality between the richest and poorest households increased by 10 per cent or more, and in a further eight countries it either widened or stayed the same. This is the \"moral failure\" that Morgan speaks of, and UNICEF is calling for action to make development gains for children more equitably shared. In the words of Claire Melamed, the Head of the Growth and Equity programme at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), we need to respond to the \"spirit of the MDGs\", not just the numerical targets.</p><p>The ODI has also produced a report assessing progress on the MDGs called the <a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4908&amp;title=mdgs-progress\">MDG Report Card</a>. One of its most interesting contibutions is to contrast \"relative\" and \"absolute\" progress towards the MDGs. The UNICEF report carries a map showing progress against MDG4 which is bleak reading for those concerned about Africa and South Asia (see graphic above). In these regions, it says, there has been \"insufficient progress\" or \"no progress\" on under-five mortality. (The world as whole is on track because of successes in Latin America and other parts of Asia.) </p><p>But hang on a minute, says the ODI report. Sub-Saharan Africa has actually made strong progress on reducing under-five mortality, with a reduction from 157 per 1000 to 124 per 1000 between 1990 and 2007. That means millions of children saved, now and in the future. But if you start from a worse position, it is harder to do well on the relative measure, which the UNICEF report uses, and which gives Africa only a 20% reduction. </p><p>Save the Children has also published a report on MDG progress for children, <a href=\"http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/lib.nsf/db900sid/NROI-8949M8/$file/sc-sep2010.pdf?openelement\">A fair chance at life</a>, which raises another classic stats trap: while the percentage of children dying before the age of five is down in sub-Saharan Africa, the actual number has risen since 1990, because of population growth. </p><p><a

money smoothly and quickly into the hands of those who desperately need it - and know how to use it - is a perennial problem faced by both governments and non-government agencies. Joseph Malinga, our reporter based in Katine, north-eastern Uganda, only yesterday wrote on our site that it has now taken five months for funding to arrive in Katine to replace the losses suffered by a farmers' savings group following a robbery last year.</p><p>Katine is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/sep/23/background.news/\">community development project</a>, involving 66 villages in six parishes across a large area and covering the full range of development issues. The non-government agency <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/amref/\">Amref (African Medical Research Foundation (Amref)</a>, which is implementing the project, funded by Guardian readers and Barclays Bank, works in several countries and through various national and local administration offices in Africa and elsewhere. Each office handling the funds requires them to go through an exhaustive checking procedure to ensure the targeted community group receives the money.</p><p>The question is whether there is a faster, more efficient way of processing funds. Incomprehensible or unexplained delays in funds reaching destinations can shatter people's hopes and dreams - delays sadly common within many NGOs funding development work. Despite the Guardian's repeated calls to Amref to speed up the transfer of funds to the Emorikikinos farmers' village saving and loan association, Amref has still taken five months to move the money from its HQ office in Nairobi, Kenya, to Katine, Uganda - Kenya's southern neighbour. </p><p>Surely, regardless of all the sound reasons given for delays, there needs to be an change in procedures? For not only in this case have the farmers, who have long been complaining about the delay, probably been disadvantraged (perhaps they can let us know how?), but the morale of much of the community will, inevitably, have been affected too. </p><p>Are there, in fact, ways to improve dissemination of funds, given the need to keep funding processes clear, transparent and secure? How can systems such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/mobile-networks-social-change-third-world/\">M-pesa money transfer service,</a> launched in Kenya in 2007, be used to plug gaps in processes used now between funding agencies and beneficiaries?</p><p>Funding is a complicated process but modern technology should be able to simplify and speed up payments.

Can we pay for our flight tickets now to avoid paying the increases in travel tax (November) and VAT (January). </strong><br /><strong>Rod Birch</strong></p><p>No and no, but it's not all bad news. Airline tickets are not subject to VAT so will be unaffected by the rise. Air Passenger Duty is added on according to departure date, not the time of booking, so the increased rates apply on any flights booked from 1 November. The Civil Aviation Authority has <a href=\"http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=589&amp;pagetype=90&amp;pageid=2449\" title=\"\">some explanation of the taxes, fees and charges</a> added to all airline tickets. Some airlines will add their own, including Ryanair's \"Ins &amp; WCHR levy\", which refers to charges added to cover the increase in aviation insurance after 9/11 and a €0.50 per passenger charge to cover the costs of any passengers using  a wheelchair.</p><p><strong>We want to travel to Jordan for a week at the beginning of November. We would like to cycle from Amman to Petra and then bus back. Will we be allowed to put two bikes on a bus? Is it possible to camp or would you advise booking accommodation in advance for each night of our stay? </strong><br /><strong>Georgina Fogo</strong></p><p>One of the joys of travelling in the Middle East and Africa is the ability to transport most things on the bus or train. One minibus journey I took in Eritrea was made considerably more interesting by the logistical challenge of placing and keeping four goats on the roof of the vehicle as it wound up hairpin roads to the capital, Asmara. Getting around is more straightforward in Jordan. Bikes can usually be put in the luggage compartments of buses or on the roof of minibuses and you may have to pay a small fee for their carriage. Jordanian hospitality to all visitors including those on two wheels is rightly famed, but one word of warning: several cyclists note being subject to stone-throwing by local youths as they rode. One cyclist quoted in Lonely Planet's Jordan guide recommends setting out early and doing the bulk of your riding when children are at school. You will be fine to book accommodation as you go, which is a better option than trying to find a secluded spot to camp.</p><p><strong>I hope to travel from Cape Town, South Africa to Kampala, Uganda by public transport around mid-October. I know the countries en route fairly well  but any advice will be most welcome. </strong><br /><strong>Graham Tottle</strong></p><p>Giving specific advice for an adventurous journey across 2,500 miles is tricky. There are plenty of combinations of routes, though the most direct one will take you through Botswana, Zambia, and Tanzania, and from there you have a variety of routes into Uganda, either taking a combination of ferry to Kenya and onward bus, edging your way through Tanzania straight into Uganda or detouring via Rwanda. There's little that's complicated about your planned journey, though as you're familiar with the countries in question you'll already understand that you should be prepared for delays to journeys and, to a greater or lesser extent, unreliable vehicles once you get into Zambia and points north. Along with patience and plenty of time, you'll need visas for each country you pass through, with the exception of South Africa and Botswana. In most cases these can be obtained at the border but you should check the latest at the relevant High Commission or Embassy website – <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/foreign-embassy-in-the-uk/\" title=\"\">you can find a list here</a>. At some point a combined East African Community visa should make entry into Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi as simple as getting one permit, but this has yet to materialise.</p><p><strong>My wife and I are planning a trip to St Petersburg, but are unsure how long to plan for the visit. We are thinking of a five-night stay. </strong><br /><strong>Chris Piggott</strong></p><p>Plenty of people do go to St Petersburg for just two or three days, but you're wise to go for more. You could spend a whole day or more in the Hermitage alone, but a good balance is one morning and one afternoon, not on the same day. Book online (<a href=\"http://www.hermitagemuseum.org\" title=\"\">hermitagemuseum.org</a>) to beat what can be whopping queues. Highlights depend on your own interests, but the Imperial stateroom and apartments and associated great halls, the Pavilion Hall and rooms devoted to Raphael and his contemporaries are top of many people's lists. The majority of visitors aren't quite so strategic and wander the second floor before departing with mild burn-out. If you're finding the crowds too much in one part of the museum, there are hundreds of other rooms to aim for. Arrive early if you want to visit the special collections in the Gold and Diamond rooms. Tours cost extra and places are limited, so sort this out when you first get there. If the weather is on your side, a stroll in the nearby Summer Garden is a lovely way to finish a visit.</p><p>Away from the Hermitage, a cruise on the river Neva is a superb way to see the city, though boats tend to only run from May to October. St Isaac's Cathedral, the Church of the Saviour of the Spilled Blood and the Peter &amp; Paul Fortress are the other well-known classic sights of the city that you should see in three days, leaving time for a walking tour. Peter's Walking Tours (<a href=\"http://www.peterswalk.com/\" title=\"\">peterswalk.com</a>) has a wide range of itineraries and come strongly recommended. With your remaining time, pick one of Petrodvorets Palace and Gardens or the Hermitage Storage Facility. For something off-beat, the Museum of Railway Technology behind the former Warsaw station is home to dozens of well-preserved locos and a mobile nuclear missile launcher. As with many central and eastern European cities, <a href=\"http://www.inyourpocket.com/russia/st-petersburg\" title=\"\">In Your Pocket has a helpful guide</a>.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2010/9/15/1284545786289/Facade-of-The-Hermitage-M-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2010/sep/15/ask-tom-jordan-st-petersburg","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/travel/blog/2010/sep/15/ask-tom-jordan-st-petersburg","sectionName":"Travel"},{"webTitle":"Aid spending and aid received: does more aid mean more development?","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-15T07:30:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/datablog/2010/sep/15/aid-spending-received-statistics","fields":{"body":"<p>As the numbers are published on progress towards the MDGs, many people are asking about the links between rich country aid programmes and improved outcomes for poor people. Watch as world leaders emerge from the big <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/mdg/summit2010/\">MDG summit in New York</a> and glide seamlessly from a discussion of poverty to a confident declaration that improving statistics on child health/maternal health/income poverty/access to water are a sign that aid is working. Meanwhile the usual band of sceptics will latch onto any negative stat and parade it as proof that aid is useless and that, in general, all is doomed. In reality, though, we don't have strong enough evidence to make either of these claims.<br /> <br />There are two broad and annoyingly general statements that I do think we can make sensibly about aid and the MDGs. Firstly, there is a large group of countries for whom aid is almost entirely irrelevant. The strong progress against poverty in China and Brazil (and most of Latin America), and the fairly good progress in India, for example, have next to nothing to do with aid. We can say this with confidence because aid to these countries is miniscule as a percentage of their GDP, so while we could debate for ages what the factors of progress are (presumably a combination of rising wealth and sensible spending decisions at a national level) we know that aid is not one of them.<br /> <br />Notably, it is in these countries where progress measured in numbers of people is greatest, simply because these countries are very populous. So progress here means global progress – they are the motor of the MDGs, and aid doesn't matter (when aid is defined as a transfer of money – other forms of international support and cooperation may have been relevant).<br /> <br />But there is a second group of countries which are highly dependent on aid – smaller, poorer countries, mostly in Africa, some in Asia and a handful in Latin America. Our second and even more annoyingly general statement is that in these countries aid has certainly been very relevant... we just don't know in what way. Sorry.<br /> <br />How do we know that aid is very relevant? Simply because aid is such a large part of the budget and therefore also of the social/political/economic decision making processes. In countries like Burundi (where aid is about 50% of GNI), Guinea Bissau (35%), Mozambique (26%) and Sierra Leone (33%) it would be impossible for aid not to be enormously important.<br /> <br />Progress in these countries has not been as obvious as in the first group of countries, although examples of countries where no progress has been made are few and far between. But has aid been a positive factor, or a negative one? It is very difficult to make general statements about the relationship between aid and (lack of) progress. Where progress is strong, is it because of high levels of aid, or in spite of them? Where progress is weak, the same question applies. Even if there was a clear graph showing that more/less aid leads to more/less progress (which there doesn't seem to be) it wouldn't help much because it would tell us little about causality, the holy and elusive grail of statistical analysis.<br /> <br />To know if aid is working, we need to get to know the political aspects of the specific recipient country, and the particulars of the aid modalities. In some, conditions attached to aid by donors (which have undermined productive capacity leading to less food and fewer jobs) or long term aid dependence (that has so undermined political capacity and accountability that the state is now less able than previously to deliver public goods) mean that, overall, aid may have had a negative effect on poverty reduction, despite the positive stories of change we may read about in donor annual reports. But in others aid has been managed much better, with fewer negative consequences, allowing its positive impacts to dominate – real changes in the lives of poor people.<br /> <br />It all depends on the specifics. Apart from my two very broad-brush groups there are a lot of countries in between where I'm afraid we have to be even more circumspect. So apologies to all those who wanted a neat graph showing how aid helps/hinders poverty reduction. There isn't one.</p><p><strong>Do you agree?

first became involved in the fight against extreme poverty and disease in developing countries after being asked to join the Drop the Debt Jubilee 2000 movement. In 2002 he co-founded ONE (originally called DATA), which now has 2 million members around the world. He is also the co-founder of Product (RED), a business that partners with global brands to support the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria through the sale of (RED) products.</p><p>Bono regularly lobbies the heads of G8 nations on effective aid, corruption and trade reform and was part of a worldwide movement that resulted in the 2005 G8 promise to double aid to Africa. More recently, Bono and ONE, together with the Publish What You Pay coalition, successfully campaigned for US legislation requiring greater transparency in the oil, gas and mining industries. Bono and ONE are now seeking to establish similar legislation across Europe.</p><p>Bono received the Legion D'Honneur in 2003, was TIME Magazine's Person of the Year for 2005 (along with Bill and Melinda Gates), and accepted an honorary British knighthood in 2007.

We have been well aware for some time that the massive populations of China and India alone mean they host more poor people than the entire population of Africa, let alone just the African poor. </p><p>Others might wonder why this matters. After all, the <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups\">World Bank's LIC/MIC classification is  fairly random</a>. Countries with a GDP per capita of $995 or less are called \"low income\", cross that threshold and you become \"middle income\". So what?</p><p>The statistic matters because it raises serious questions about the way donor countries use aid in the future. And the paper matters because it is another well-argued case for a rethink of the tired aid dynamics that have now held sway for over half a century. Its message contrasts with one of the most influential papers/books to have been published in the last few years, Paul Collier's \"The Bottom Billion\".</p><p>Collier, in his important and well-argued contribution, comes up with that rare thing: a statistic that sticks in the mind and changes the language. His main argument is that development efforts should now be focused more exclusively on a group of the poorest countries in the world which are falling behind the rest, in which about a billion people live. Such thinking has become very influential in the corridors of aid power with Ban Ki Moon, the UN's Secretary General, going so far as to declare 2008 the \"<a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=25222&amp;Cr=Ban&amp;Cr1=Ki-moon\">year of the bottom billion</a>\". To focus on this group of 1 billion people would mean focusing on the 60 or so countries which have failed to \"take off\" in the last few decades. </p><p>But Sumner takes a direct swipe at this logic, calling his paper <em>Global Poverty and the New Bottom Billion</em>. In his view, the fact that most poor people live in countries that have taken off economically, means we need to find a new way of helping the poor in these MICs, and that means focusing on poor people, not just poor countries (as Collier suggests). </p><p>And if Sumner is right (which he is), that means fundamentally changing the way we give aid and encourage poverty reduction. It is one thing transferring money to very poor countries – there is a logical argument for filling a savings gap, although one that I have <a href=\"http://troublewithaid.blogspot.com/\">criticised</a>. But to transfer cash to countries like China and India that not only have nuclear power and space programmes, but also have their own multi-billion dollar aid programmes, is quite another. Aid money is irrelevant to them – should the traditional donors therefore just leave them to it? </p><p>The world needs to find new ways to help other countries respond to persistant poverty and increasing inequality. The era of aid as we know it is ending. Let's hope that a new era of development cooperation takes its place. </p><p><a name=\"data\"></p><h2>Download the data</h2><p></a><br />• <a

It also asked respondents to rank how happy they are with life. </p><p>The results gave an indication of a \"global Big society\" with a fifth of the world's population had volunteered, almost a third of the world's population had given money to charity, and 45% of the world's population had been \"good samaritans\" and helped a stranger.</p><p>The UK came eighth on the index and finished joint third, alongside Thailand, in terms of giving money, with 73% of the population having donated to charity. However its former colonial possessions - Australia, New Zealand and the United States - were far more charitable. In Europe only Ireland, Switzerland and Holland fared better. </p><p>Rich countries dominated the top positions yet around half of the top twenty most charitable were developing nations such as  as Guinea, Guyana and Turkmenistan. Strikingly India ranked at 134 and China at 147 - with Chinese people among the least likely on the planet to volunteer. Only 4% said they would.</p><p>• This article was amended on 21 March 2011.

A summit of ministers agreed that the study would also draft a common space policy for the 53 member countries.

Others said the continent can ill-afford to pour scarce resources into stargazing when millions continue to face poverty, disease and food shortages.</p><p>But the future is already here, if unevenly distributed.

A media blackout ushered the country into 2008, ensuring there was little coverage of a crisis that would go on to claim more than 1,100 lives and displace more than a quarter of a million people.</p><p>Okolloh, a prominent lawyer, recalls the contested Kenyan election of late 2007: \"There was a realisation that we're not that far from a civil war. There was fear and anger, and a sense of community soon grew. It spiralled completely when people were struggling to find out what was going on, including journalists.\"</p><p>Widespread protests escalated into ethnic violence as the president, Mwai Kibaki, was declared to have been re-elected on 30 December 2007. Raila Odinga, leader of the opposition, claimed the vote was rigged. Okolloh took to the internet as her country turned to ruins.</p><p>Posting updates on her Kenyan Pundit blog, Okolloh soon became deluged with comments from people reporting instances of violence throughout the troubled country. There has to be a better way of sharing this information, she thought. Then, two days after coming up with an idea, she <a href=\"http://www.kenyanpundit.com/2008/01/09/ushahidicom/\" title=\"wrote\">wrote</a>: \"Last week, in between nightmares about where my country was going, I was dreaming of a Google mashup to document incidents of violence, looting, etc that have occurred during the post-election crisis. Today, Ushahidi is born.\"</p><p>Two years later, when a colossal earthquake struck Haiti and 1.5 million people were left homeless, her platform for crowdsourcing crises was put to work again. Within four days, Ushahidi was said to have received more than 100,000 reports from the ground. A fortnight later, volunteers had only managed to process half the messages. To date, the application has been downloaded more than 4,100 times.</p><p>Ushahidi – Swahili for \"testimony\" – works by mapping user-generated reports of incidents submitted by SMS, email and Twitter and via the web. The text message option means that those submitting information do not need to have access to the internet, which makes reporting incidents open to many more people in the developing world: Kenya has 17 million mobile phone users.</p><p>\"It feels like it was just last year,\" says Erik Hersman, one of Ushahidi's founding members, reflecting on the two days in January 2008 when \"the world's greatest crowdsourcing tool\" went from being an idea to a platform pinpointing a sequence of catastrophes.</p><p>\"In the first week of post-election violence we were all blogging and it was this one bullet point on a long blogpost that mentioned Google Maps and I thought, 'Ah – we could do something with that',\" he recalls. \"We were looking for technological solutions to overcome the inefficiencies of commenting – that looked like a good answer to it. We Skyped and tried to get a few people involved, then we were only 24 hours into this idea about what it could be and we were talking about names. All the good ones were taken.</p><p>\"We cared about the micro game. If we cared about the macro game, we wouldn't have chosen the name Ushahidi! The feeling was that we needed to get this out there, even if it wasn't perfect. We launched it on the Monday after a weekend of work, thinking it's got to be better than nothing.\"</p><p>But, apart from a few structural updates, little substantial had changed in Ushahidi until now. Groups wishing to use the tool – be they collections of citizens, international humanitarian bodies or media organisations – had to install the platform on a local server and pay for domain hosting rights. All of which acts as a barrier to entry.</p><p>This month those barriers were removed and Ory Okolloh, very much the mother of Ushahidi, is under no illusions as to how important this new service – dubbed \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/aug/11/ushahidi-crowdmap-crisis-mapping\" title=\"Crowdmap\">Crowdmap</a>\" – is. \"This is huge. It's a landmark,\" she says. \"This has the potential to take us to the next level in terms of scale, like Blogger did for blogging – Crowdmap has the potential to do that for mapping.</p><p>\"A lot of the groups wanting to use Ushahidi didn't have a techy person to assist or couldn't afford a host, so the idea is to make the tool more accessible, like with WordPress and wordpress.com.\"</p><p>With expertise, Ushahidi can already be deployed within a matter of hours.</p><p>In the past week, extreme weather conditions sweeping across large swaths of China, Russia and Pakistan have brought Ushahidi into new territories. Faced with the worst drought since records began, Russian bloggers found that the best way to co-ordinate a relief effort was to use Ushahidi. This should comes as no surprise, but its use from Haiti to Chile, Pakistan to Congo, Philippines to Peru, Kenya to China, never fails to astound the four-person team whose idea was born out of a close-to-home crisis.</p><p>\"I don't think I've processed it yet,\" Okolloh says. \"If you'd asked me three years ago if we'd still be doing this I'd have said: 'Forget it'. We had so many things we didn't have a clue how to do. There was a naivety we had when we started off – we just wanted to make it easier for people to tell stories. But I also think it's important for us not to underestimate the influential role we play.\"</p><p>When she spoke at this year's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/blog/ushahidi-activate-conference\" title=\"Guardian Activate conference\">Guardian Activate conference</a>, Ushahidi launched a drive for a sustainable future. Picking up awards and the money that goes with them is fine for now, the group know. But when the novelty vanishes, it's a certainty that the disasters won't do the same. And that's why it matters.</p><p>\"Everybody thinks we have money but we don't,\" Okolloh laughs. \"We're still largely supported by foundations and it will take years before we wean ourselves off that, but the aim is that we become sustainable. When you think of tools like Google or Facebook, I wonder what it's like for your creation to become a verb. That is what I dream about.\"</p><p>You can see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/series/activate-2010-videos\">video from the Activate conference</a> now at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate\">guardian.co.uk/activate</a>.

Or Julian Assange? And yet, seven days after the biggest intelligence leak of all time – the publication of over 75,000 files amounting to an entire history of the Afghanistan war – he is everywhere; in every newspaper, on every news broadcast, in what appears to be every country in the world. It's been an extraordinary week for WikiLeaks, which has seen the entrance on to the world stage of a remarkable new character: Assange, a man who, even friends and supporters admit, looks \"a bit like a Bond villain\".</p><p>Could it be the week that changed the war in Afghanistan? It's possible, if the revelations contained in the files swing popular and then political opinion. At the very least, they've triggered a whole new debate about the future course of the conflict. Because what the files revealed was the sheer scale and exhausting mundane detail of the everyday violence suffered by Afghan civilians, caused by coalition forces as well as the Taliban, as well as evidence of what may or not be double-dealing on the part of Pakistan government.</p><p>By last Wednesday, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan had branded Assange \"irresponsible\". And by Friday, the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, had accused him of \"having blood on his hands\". Their charge was that WikiLeaks has disclosed the names of Afghan collaborators who may now be subject to reprisals; that the information is unchecked; that some of it may be of dubious provenance, and that Assange  seems to be accountable to no one.</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising and confusing aspect of all this is that Assange didn't leak the material. He was not the source for these files, he merely published them. Where once, the focus was on the whistleblower, it's now on the technological conduit by which the whistleblower can reach the world.</p><p>By the time I come to talk to Assange, his very last interview of the week, the backlash is in full swing. \"Have you seen this?\" he says waving a copy of the <em>Times</em> at me. \"Have you seen how much bullshit this is? Have you seen page 13? Do you think I should call [the libel law firm] Carter-Ruck?</p><p>\"It would be a bit silly for me but I'm tempted to. Just look at the headlines and the photo. What's the imputation?\"</p><p>There's a photo of Assange below a headline that reads \"'Taliban hitlist' row: WikiLeaks founder says he did right thing\". And next to the photo, another headline reading \"Named man is already dead.\" The imputation is quite clearly that Assange's actions have resulted in the man's death, although in the story itself it makes it clear that he actually died two years ago.</p><p>\"Is it clear?\" says Assange. \"Let's see how much we have to read before we reach that information. It's not in the first paragraph, second, third, fourth, it's not in the fifth. It's not until the sixth paragraph you learn that.\"</p><p>The <em>Times </em>had splashed on its front page the claims that there are named Afghan sources in the files whose lives are now in danger. It's pure \"self-interest\", he says, designed to undermine the <em>Guardian</em>, the <em>Observer</em>'s sister paper and one of three publications to publish stories based on the files, the others being the <em>New York Times </em>and <em>Der Spiegel</em>. \"You can see that this is coming down from editorial, not up from journalism.\"</p><p>Maybe. Although it doesn't mean that there aren't hard questions to answer. What about these named sources? Might he have endangered their lives?</p><p>\"If there are innocent Afghans being revealed, which was our concern, which was why we kept back 15,000 files, then of course we take that seriously.\"</p><p>But what if it's too late?</p><p>\"Well, we will review our procedures.\"</p><p>Too late for the individuals, I say. Dead.</p><p>\"Well, anything might happen but nothing has happened. And we are not about to leave the field of doing good simply because harm might happen … In our four-year publishing history no one has ever come to physical harm that we are aware of or that anyone has alleged. On the other hand, we have changed governments and constitutions and had tremendous positive outcomes.\"</p><p>If Afghan informers are at risk, he says, the fault lies squarely with the US military. \"We are appalled that the US military was so lackadaisical with its Afghan sources. Just appalled. We are a source protection organisation that specialises in protecting sources, and have a perfect record from our activities.</p><p>\"This material was available to every soldier and contractor in Afghanistan&nbsp;…It's the US military that deserves the blame for not giving due diligence to its informers.\"</p><p>Not everyone agrees. There's a school of thought, to which a leading article in the <em>Times</em> gave voice, that he is playing a dangerous game. He says he hasn't read it, so I quote a chunk: \"The sanctimonious piety of the man is sickening.\"</p><p>\"Oh sure,\" he says. \"Because it would be better to be a ruthless media mogul just in it for the money. That would be then be acceptable. We can't actually have people doing something for moral reasons. It's only acceptable if we do it just for the money.\"</p><p>It is possible that this is part of it. When Julian Assange burst on to the world stage last week, people grappled to make sense of him, of WikiLeaks, of the new hybrid formed by old media – the <em>Guardian</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Der Spiegel </em>– co-operating with a radical, activist, very new media, what the <em>New Yorker </em>described as less an organisation, more \"a media insurgency\".</p><p>It is no coincidence that last week marked WikiLeaks' most successful operation to date, and also the implementation of what is quite clearly a new media strategy. Not just its new step of co-operating with three international news organisations but also the decision, made over the past few months, for Assange himself to come out of the shadows and take up a public role as the WikiLeaks' front man.</p><p>\"We started off like the <em>Economist</em>,\" he told a packed audience at the Frontline Club on Tuesday, meaning they retained complete anonymity. \"We wanted to make the news, not be the news. But that produced extraordinary curiosity as to who we were ... this attempt not to be the news, made us the news.\"</p><p>This new openness seems designed to counter one of the greatest criticisms of the organisation: its lack of accountability. Because what this week has made clear is that it is no longer governments who can choose what to keep secret, it is WikiLeaks.</p><p>It feels like there's been some sort of revolution, I say to him, but one which the world is still struggling to understand. In reply, he deploys one of his deadly monotones: \"We are creating a space behind us that permits a form of journalism which lives up to the name that journalism has always tried to establish for itself. We are creating that space because we are taking on the criticism that comes from robust exposure of powerful groups.\"</p><p>It is interesting that he phrases it this way because, as well as being a new and radically different model of what is and isn't possible in the news future, Assange himself is a curious hybrid.</p><p>His skills as a cryptographer led him to becoming one of the architects of the WikiLeaks model, but as Gavin MacFadyen, the director of the Centre of Investigative Journalism and a friend of his, points out, there's something almost old-fashioned about his particular brand of committed idealism.</p><p>\"We don't really see people like him any more. In the 60s and 70s, they were around. Those who are totally committed and passionate about what they're doing. But not after 20 years of Thatcherism.\"</p><p>There was a video of Assange on the centre's website, and \"our server crashed\", says MacFadyen. \"There's no doubt he's an inspirational figure.\" He is also \"probably the most intelligent person I've ever worked with\" and has an \"unusual amount of self-confidence\".</p><p>When you interview Assange, this seems like an understatement. He is at least five steps ahead. Probably more. But then, as he told the <em>New Yorker</em>, what appealed to him about computers was their austerity: \"It is like chess – chess is very austere, in that you don't have many rules, there is no randomness, and the problem is very hard.\"</p><p>David Leigh, the <em>Guardian</em>'s investigations editor who oversaw publication of the files, says Assange has the mentality of a hacker, \"a distinct psychological genre\". At times, he can seem almost autistic, although \"he doesn't lack charm\".</p><p>That is perhaps the most surprising thing about Assange. The first time I meet him, a fortnight before publication of the files, he's tense and edgy. With good reason, it turns out. The second time, after a speaking engagement at the Frontline Club, the journalists' club in West London he made his base for the week, he's like a man transformed: relaxed and clearly enjoying himself. He makes jokes. He even smiles. The third time, he looks simply exhausted. And yet, he's also still quite clearly up for taking on all-comers.</p><p>Vaughan Smith, the director of the Frontline Club, tells me that he's more or less subsisted on \"two hours' sleep and two sandwiches\". But then, there's something about Assange that if not superhuman, is almost as if sleep and food are mere technicalities that might concern the rest of us, but that he has found a way of simply dispensing with. Combat, intellectual combat, seems to be his stimulant of choice. It just fuels him.</p><p>When I try to question him about the morality of what he's done, if he worries about unleashing something that he can't control, that no one can control, he tells me the story of the Kenyan 2007 elections when a WikiLeak document \"swung the election\".</p><p>The leak exposed massive corruption by Daniel Arap Moi, and the Kenyan people sat up and took notice. In the ensuing elections, in which corruption became a major issue, violence swept the country. \"1,300 people were eventually killed, and 350,000 were displaced. That was a result of our leak,\" says Assange. It's a chilling statistic, but then he states: \"On the other hand, the Kenyan people had a right to that information and 40,000 children a year die of malaria in Kenya. And many more die of money being pulled out of Kenya, and as a result of the Kenyan shilling being debased.\"</p><p>It's the kind of moral conundrum that would unnerve most people, that made some wonder last week what the potential ramifications of the latest leak might be, but it is a subject on which Assange himself is absolutely clear: \"You have to start with the truth. The truth is the only way that we can get anywhere. Because any decision-making that is based upon lies or ignorance can't lead to a good conclusion.\"</p><p>The other key thing about WikiLeaks is that it's internationalist in the true sense. \"We do not have national security concerns. We have concerns about human beings,\" says Assange. And, with its servers located in different countries, and its headquarters nowhere, it raises intriguing questions about the future of nation states. WikiLeaks seems to be beyond the power of any of them, although Assange jumps on me pretty fast when I suggest as much.</p><p>\"Of course not. We have had over 100 legal attacks. We have been victorious in almost every single legal attack. As far as nation states are concerned, we operate within the rule of law.\"</p><p>But it is an organisation that has been brilliantly constructed to get around such assaults, and with each release of information, it seems to evolve and grow stronger.</p><p>Even if it's not yet known, can't be known, what the long-term impact of this particular leak will be.</p><p>David Leigh describes Assange as \"a mendicant friar of the electronic age\". Like his organisation, he is global and rootless. And when he does sleep, it's usually on somebody else's sofa.</p><p>But Leigh also says \"it's actually fairly irrelevant to talk about whether what Julian is doing is a bad thing or a good thing, because if he wasn't doing it, somebody else would\".</p><p>Assange might be an arresting figure and WikiLeaks an extraordinary organisation, but they are manifestations of a phenomenon, he says, not its root cause.</p><p>\"He's a function of technological change.

And, more important, why should I care?</h2><p>For 22 years, Ted was a conference, an exclusive ideas forum where the great and the good came to hear Al Gore talk about climate change and Bill Gates about computing, right up until four years ago, when TED Talks was launched online and promptly became an internet sensation. It's a bit like YouTube, but instead of featuring cats falling into lavatories, it has short, cutting-edge talks by the world's leading neuroscientists, behavioural economists, video artists, philosophers, particle physicists, rocket scientists, endurance athletes, Aids researchers… you name it, it's been at TED.</p><p>What TED does is seek out the most interesting, unusual and potentially groundbreaking ideas on Earth and then provide a platform to share them with the world. At the heart of it all are the conferences. The main event takes place once a year in Long Beach, California, and in a week's time the new, annual <a href=\"http://conferences.ted.com/TEDGlobal2010/program/oxford.php\" title=\"\">TED Global conference will take place in Oxford</a>. It's a smaller, more intimate affair – 700 delegates (it's 2,000 at Long Beach) listening to 50 speakers over four consecutive days.</p><p>There is no shortage of shadowy, elite conferences where masters of the universe converge on Swiss mountain tops or exclusive Mediterranean resorts in order to plot world domination (think the World Economic Forum in Davos or last month's Bilderberg Group in Sitges). TED, however, is a shadowy, elite conference where masters of the universe converge in order to plot how to make the world a nicer, fairer, better place. It's a not-for-profit foundation and it's something like the World Economic Forum might be if capitalism were replaced as the world's dominant ideological system by, say, optimism.</p><p>Can TED change the world? Possibly, possibly not. But trying to tackle social problems such as eradicating world hunger or reversing climate change seems a better place to start than, say, dreaming up new ways of propping up failed financial institutions with large injections of public money. It's this mission that has helped TED attract a mix of thinkers, writers, scientists, hedge-fund billionaires, tech entrepreneurs, philanthropists and radical ideologues. And that's just the audience.</p><p>The unique thing about TED is that people such as Richard Dawkins, Bill Clinton, philosopher Daniel Dennett and biologist-entrepreneur Craig Venter speak for free and people such as Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin pay to listen.</p><p></p><h2>It sounds awfully elitist…</h2><p>It is. That's the point, or at least it used to be. It's also expensive, at £3,460 a ticket for TED Global and almost £4,000 for TED in Long Beach (even a live simulcast event in Palm Springs costs £2,500), although money, in itself, will get you only so far. The main conference sells out within days of tickets being released, a year in advance, and a tough vetting procedure is enforced. To be invited, you must fill out an extensive application form, which includes questions such as what are your greatest personal achievements and how have they had an impact on society?</p><p>For the first 22 years of its existence, TED was held in the chichi California seaside town of Monterey and was the hottest four-day dinner party on Earth; it was a kind of spring break for world thinkers, a place of inspiring ideas, but which only the select few would hear.</p><p>But in 2006, once speaker after speaker had stood on the stage and talked about the Creative <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\" title=\"\">Commons licences</a>, open-source software, the wisdom of crowds and how the internet could leverage an individual idea into a mass, public action, TED took the decision to release these talks online (at<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/\" title=\"\"> ted.com</a>).</p><p>The response has been astonishing: there are, to date, 727 talks online. Eighteen months ago, they had been viewed 50 million times; today, the viewing figure stands at more than 290 million. TED has gone viral. Ideas have become the new rock'n'roll.</p><p></p><h2>And TED is its Glastonbury?</h2><p>It is. Obscure academics toiling away in unknown research institutes have been dragged into the light and turned into superstars. Everybody at TED cites the example of Hans Rosling, a Swedish, bespectacled professor of international health whose <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html\" title=\"\">TED talk</a> on that unlikely hot-button topic, statistics, has now been seen by millions (a top tip to professors of international health everywhere: try underlining your final point by swallowing a sword).</p><p>The talks are not constrained by national or linguistic boundaries. The Open Translation Project, launched last year, encourages volunteers to translate talks using a Wikipedia-type model; in just a year, talks have been translated into 77 languages, with 8,500 completed and another 23,000 ongoing. All free of charge.</p><p>TED's new motto is \"radical openness\", which means that it gives away all its content free. But (and here's a trick to remember, newspaper executives), at its heart it's still exclusive and expensive. A bit of elitism, it turns out, is good for business. TED makes money, lots of money, and then tries to think up the most interesting ways of giving it away again.</p><p>But brilliantly, and possibly uniquely, TED has no VIP section, no special celebtastic treatment. Last year, in Oxford, Meg Ryan and Cameron Diaz showed up and, like everyone else at the conference, had to wear massive name tags the size of a dinner plate, which said MEG RYAN and CAMERON DIAZ. Even then, at least half the audience had no idea who they actually were and mobbed the theoretical physicist standing next to them. </p><h2>Why the silly name?</h2><p>Because in 1984, when it was founded by an information architect called Richard Saul Wurman, its mission was to bring together the brightest brains in technology, entertainment and design. And this it did. At that first conference, a whizzy new computer was unveiled: the very first Apple Macintosh. And somebody brought along some funny shiny silver discs, which was how the world was introduced to the CD Rom.</p><p>It was still largely about TED when, in 2001, Chris Anderson bought the organisation on behalf of his Sapling Foundation.</p><p></p><h2></h2> No, this is another Chris Anderson. Although, to confuse things, Chris Anderson Mark 1 has been known to speak at TED. This is British <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/speakers/chris_anderson_ted.html\" title=\"\">Chris Anderson</a>, who started out as a journalist before setting up one of the first hobbyist computer magazines, which went on to spawn a publishing empire, Future Publishing, boasting 130 magazines in Britain and America.</p><p>It was when he bought TED that it began to change. Because Anderson is not your average multimillionaire entrepreneur. He was born in rural Pakistan and his parents were missionaries (his father was also an eye surgeon who worked for years in the developing world). And while sometimes the rich discover a social conscience after they've made their fortune, Anderson had one from birth. It was this, a degree in philosophy, plus some business nous and publishing experience that showed him how TED could be transformed from an elitist talking shop into a global ideas platform. Which is exactly what it has done.</p><p>Anderson says it was \"not a top-down plan\" but a \"bottom-up phenomenon\". He believes it's because there was a demand for TED-type content, an appetite for ideas communicated in an inspirational way. \"We put the talks out there, but it's only because people are excited by learning new stuff that it's become this amazing thing.\"</p><p>Although there's still a techie element to TED (last year, for example, saw a demonstration of a television powered by wireless electricity), it has developed a new seriousness under Anderson. Its slogan is \"Ideas Worth Spreading\" and it is constantly challenging its members to apply their collective brainpower to intractable social issues. It was at TED that Al Gore first delivered the talk which became <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>.</p><p>In 2005, the TED prize was inaugurated. It's awarded annually to an \"exceptional individual\", who receives $100,000 and the support of Tedsters and the TED community to carry out \"One Wish to Change the World\". So far, it has spawned a Charter for Compassion, the big idea of Karen Armstrong, the former nun turned religious academic; and from EO Wilson, the scientist who coined the term \"sociobiology\", an Encyclopaedia of Life. This year's winner, to the surprise of those who still think of him as that puppy-faced bloke from Essex, was Jamie Oliver. His wish is to create a popular movement that will inspire people to change the way they eat.</p><p></p><h2>Tedsters?</h2><p>It's unfortunate but true. Delegates and speakers are indeed called Tedsters. Even the somewhat uncuddly ones, such as Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch.</p><h2>What is a TED talk?</h2><p>Quite apart from anything else, it's short. Each speaker has just 18 minutes to sum up their life's work or their big idea and even if your talk is about how you intend to create artificial life within five years (as I heard <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2010/may/23/observer-profile-craig-venter\" title=\"\">Craig Venter</a> do in 2005 and which he did, bang on target, in 2010), you have 18 minutes and not a minute more.</p><p>The genius of this, according to Bruno Giussani, European director of TED, is that \"it's too short for an academic to do their standard 45-minute presentation and too long to improvise. You have to prepare and have to take a fresh approach. It really puts pressure on them.\"</p><p>Or, in other words, the same old shtick will not work. Speakers have to come to TED with a new shtick. While it attracts the most stellar of international speakers, cutting-edge scientists, ex-presidents, world-class philosophers and the like, the internet is a great leveller. The greatest hits online have been people you've never heard of: the <a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/2008/03/jill_bolte_tayl.php\" title=\"\">number one talk</a> on ted.com is by the neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor, who grippingly describes the day when, aged 37, she had a massive stroke and, having studied the brain for her whole career, understood, even as her brain was shutting down, exactly how it was shutting down.</p><p>At number five is David Gallo, an oceanographer who was also  a key speaker at <a href=\"http://tedxoilspill.com\" title=\"\">TED x Oilspill</a>.</p><p></p><h2>TED x what?</h2><p>TED x is the latest unlikely but spectacularly successful grassroots innovation from TED HQ. Essentially, it's a mini-TED. Self-organised and self-supporting, anyone can apply for a licence to host one, and all TED content is free, although most of those held so far use a mixture of recorded content and their own invited speakers. It was another experimental initiative, begun in spring last year, which has snowballed into a phenomenon.</p><p>As Bruno Giussani explains: \"We kept on having people contacting us, saying, 'Why can't you have a TED in Doha? Or Barcelona? Or Indonesia?' And we simply can't do that. We can't expand the conferences. But we came up with this 13 months ago and we thought that there might be perhaps 20 of them.\"</p><p>In fact, there have already been 618 TED x events in 98 countries, with another 577 planned, including TED x Tehran, which will join TED x Kibera, held in a shanty town in Kenya, and TED x Nasa, featuring a roster of rocket scientists near the Langley Research Centre in Virginia.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Last year, Gordon Brown got a standing ovation. So what equally improbable feats are predicted for this year?</h2><p>This year's theme is the somewhat untopical \"And Now the Good News\". So, no, George Osborne is not a featured speaker. \"Read any newspaper, or turn on any news report, and there's so much doom and gloom and cynicism,\" says Bruno Giussani, who has organised the programme for the event. \"But we think people are looking for a new sense of possibilities; for rationally optimistic thinkers, for solutions to big and complex problems.\"</p><p>And TED itself is proof of this, he says. It's been enabled by the new technologies, because 10 years ago, ideas simply couldn't travel so far, so fast. The ideas this year include those of Inge Missmahl, a German psychologist whose strategy for transforming Afghanistan is via the mental health of its people, and Peter Molyneux, who is revealing to the world \"Microsoft's new intuitive interface\". It's a techie's wet dream, hotly awaited but never before seen – a Wii, basically, with no Wii or, at least, you become the Wii, controlling a screen with your movements or facial expressions.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Great, where do I sign up?</h2>It's sold out, although tickets for next year's TED Global have just gone on sale. Its theme is \"The Stuff of Life\".

Technology has a role everywhere, he said, but added  that in places like Rwanda or Haiti technology provided a way to boost the \"learning environment beyond where you can take it with incremental changes.\"</p><p>Cavallo explained that the <a href=\"http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Home\">biggest impact technology had</a> on people's lives was social. Children in  favelas in Brazil who received laptops not only had an improved sense of self-worth (which reduced absenteeism from school), but they started to teach their parents to read. In Uruguay, access to computers became a catalyst for e-governance.</p><p>But technology as a driver of development has its limits. The <a href=\"http://www.vodafone.com/start/foundation/our_focus/disaster_relief/oxfam.html\">Comic Relief/Vodafone RedAlert</a> partnership may have enabled £2m to be raised in 90 seconds through SMS fundraising, but after all the interfacing, tweeting and poking, it still seems that infrastructure (road linkages, storage facilities, a good legal system and access to finance) and the will of people to look beyond themselves and their own networks are still vital for development to happen.</p><p>What was also clear was that all these ideas must be financially viable to be sustainable: KickStart moved the production of their human powered pressure irrigation pumps from Africa to China because, as Nick Moon, its co-founder explained: \"It is cheaper to ship from China to Africa than from Africa to Africa.\"</p><p>The obstacles to realising technology's potential may be considerable, but the resounding conclusion is that technology is a force for good. As David Craig, chief strategy officer of Thomson Reuters said at the end of his talk: \"The world might be a tough place, but information can make it better.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/01/05/mobile2.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/katine-chronicles-blog/2010/jul/02/technology-development","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/katine/katine-chronicles-blog/2010/jul/02/technology-development","sectionName":"Katine"},{"webTitle":"Guardian Activate 2010: live coverage","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-01T07:51:51Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/pda/2010/jun/30/guardian-activate-summit-2010-liveblog","fields":{"body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p><strong></strong></p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong></strong></p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>8.50am:</strong> Hello and welcome to the second Guardian Activate summit.

The tweets have been flying in all morning. Here's a pick:</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>9.14am:</strong> The Guardian's own Emily Bell kicked-off with a subtle reference to GoBro's unfortunate standout moment from the election campaign: \"Is this thing on?\" - <a href=\"http://twitter.com/PeterBale/statuses/17478379813\">tweets Peter Bale</a>.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>9.21am:</strong> \"<a href=\"http://1millionshirts.org/about/\">One million shirts</a> was a really big idea,\" says Zuckerman. \"It was also a really bad idea.\"</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>9.27am:</strong> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/StevenFeldman/status/17478726996\">@StevenFeldman tweets</a> some early poignancy: \"Lots of feel good today at #activate2010 no doubt. But will anyone take stock of what, if anything, was achieved from #activate2009? # fixed\"</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>10.05am:</strong> Georgia Arnold, MTV: Using MTV brand for social good. Thanks to social media, it's easy to forget that TV is technology too. Over 1trillion hours of TV watched around the world, decreasing for first time because of the internet.</p><p>MTV, powered by cable and satellite. Broadcast in 161 countries, 2bn viewers around world across five continents - 80% of our audience outside US. We have reach - potential to change, to make a positive impact on real world. Incredibly hard to impact real change, no matter how much talk.</p><p>Media-driven, people-driven impact. No longer about one-way messages - social media gives more dimension, conversation from global north to global south. </p><p>I love about social web - created an inclusive web. Fear of discrimination or judgement on topics like HIV. Points to 60% sample of 1000 Kenyans who said they watched Sugar. Not just in homes but churches and youth centres - big changes in attitudes towards relationships. More likely to get tested for HIV, less likely to have concurrent relationships and have improved attitudes towards people living with HIV.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>10.07am:</strong> Dr Aubrey de Grey, biomedical gerontologist and chief science officer of SENS Foundation, now up on stage.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>10.09am:</strong> de Grey: \"Ageing is a side-effect of being alive in the first place\" - contender for one-liner of the day. </p><p> \"We are blidingly ignorant about our own biology, although less so than we have been.\"</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>10.13am:</strong> de Grey: SENS Foundation needs time and money. We are looking for Web 2.0 specialist who might be able to give us a social-networking presence which we're lacking at the moment.</p><p>Advocacy is not any more about give a voice to people who haven't had a voice, because there's \"not much point having a voice if you're wrong.\"</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>10.18am:</strong> Emily Bell now orchestrating a Q&amp;A. Aubrey de Grey went down a storm with the audience. A plethora of contenders for Quote of the Day.</p><p>Question to de Grey: What about overpopulation?</p><p>de Grey: Those of us who want to be our own next generation have the right to be. How do we know that we're going to have any problem in this way. Birth rate going down, average age of women having first child is going up, which is very important. Unless you think it's okay to condemn people to death just because they were born a long time ago...[audience laughter stops him short of finishing].</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>10.21am:</strong> Zuckerman on macro-intervention: Remarkable work on getting people to donate, but it only scales to a certain point. We need to stop patting ourselves on the back for lending £100 and move the conversation onto macro-economic development.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>10.29am:</strong> We've got the Future Technologies award-winning presentation, followed by a VC panel session: \"How will the web's future be financed?\"</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>10.31am:</strong> Charles Cotton, director of Cambridge enterprise: Science software Mendeley won yesterday's Future Techonologies pitch.

We know the most-read authors, topics, in each field of research - we deliver real-time readership stats.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>10.35am:</strong> Launched 16 months ago, as of yesterday: 400,000 users. Database of research papers doubling every 10-12 weeks. We're now reaching 30m, confident we'll overtake Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge's 40m papers by the end of the year.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong></strong></p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>10.42am:</strong> Charles Cotton, director of Cambridge Enterprise, now chairing panel on future finance of web. Esther Dyson, chairperson, EDventure Holdings: Russia is a fascinating market - so many different ways to run a country wrong. So many ways to run a start-up right. It's in the diversity and competition that's the easy win. One great thing about Mendeley and all of yesterday's companies: solving problems.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>10.47am:</strong> Anil Hansjee, policy and public affairs board member, BCS: All start-ups know that profit is the fuel to sustain their ambitions and aims. Times have changed from first dotcom boom: amazing to see how far you can get today on so little money. Tools and platforms available enables companies enables start-ups to use APIs etc. and really get going.</p><p>Start-ups have to embrace these opportunities to get themselves launched - scalability will follow.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>10.49am:</strong> Nick Appleyard, head of digital, Technology Strategy Board: If you're going to justify investment in technology you need to understand your investor. How do you achieve that? By solving more than one problem at the same time. Make the link between latent desires of the public, ideas people have to offer these services, and then to feed that back to capabilities to make that happen.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>10.52am:</strong> Julie Meyer, founder and chief executive, Ariadne: Big difference between now and 10 years ago is cost of technology. Start-ups: you need your natural allies, don't forget that when trying to be oh, so disruptive.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>10.56am:</strong> Meyer, Ariadne: Financing of entrepreneurship - we've get to build that gold standard globally. Biggest thing that holds back UK entrepreneurs is the confidence that you can build global leading firms, there's a bigotry of low expectations. Entrepreneurs backing entrepreneurs in an ecosystem has to be the way forward in getting global leaders funded.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>10.58am:</strong> Hansjee, policy and public affairs board member, BCS: The money is there, problem has always been quality 'deal-flow' for that money - it's an ecosystem issue, not a funding issue. The ecosystem of mentorship and support has been lacking, we're now starting to see it gradually in emerging markets and the UK.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>11.01am:</strong> There's a problem with 'Google envy', says Dyson of EDventure Holdings. People need bank loans, realistic money - it's not so terrible if your restaurant doesn't turn out to be Burger King.</p><p>Problem with corruption in emerging markets. One advantage of foreign money is that they won't pay bribes, points to UK bribery law. There's a fanaticism about corruption - these companies in emerging markets need protection as well as investment. It is one of the biggest problems - the presence of people willing to steal from these new companies.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>11.05am:</strong> Appleyard, Technology Strategy Board: The model of groundsourcing (seeking micropayments/investments from those closes to you) funding is growing, fuelled by networking power of the internet.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>11.06am:</strong> Panel session comes to a close. We're back in around 30minutes after a morning break. See you on the other side.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>11.34am:</strong> People starting to filter back for the lightning presentations. Here's the full programme to keep yourself up to speed. Just FYI - we'll be out of action from around 11.50am until around 12.15pm as interwebs are being fixed somewhere nearby.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>12.24pm:</strong> Hello and welcome to the afternoon sessions. Now, we've got 'Mobilising democracy, streamlining government, improving access and empowering citizens through the internet' moderated by Tom Steinberg, founder, MySociety.</p><p>Martha Lane-Fox, UK digital champion, is up first: My title has made friends laugh a lot. 10m here in UK that have never used internet, further 2m have used once and never gone back to it.</p><p>I believe if you created joined up community access points to the internet there would be many more opportunities to get those 12m online. We often overcomplicate what it takes to get someone online.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>12.26pm:</strong> Lane-Fox: We just need to start with someone's passion, show them the benefit of getting online. All this talk of 'superfast broadband' means bugger all when some people don't even know how to get online. We need to stop overcomplicating if we're going to close down 'digital divide' in this country - a phrase Lane-Fox says says she hates.</p><p>Four million of the 10m that have never been online are most socially and economically deprived in the country. It's not about having a computer in your home, it's about having a community access point.</p><p>It's very important to keep focused on power for social cohesion access to the web brings with it.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>12.31pm:</strong> Now up: Stephen Clift, e-democracy. His three key messages: local matters, civility matters, cohesion matters.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> Clift: Local voices matter - but listening also matters. That's the most democratising, effective level for openness and engagement that works. Civility matters. Why do we accept norms of flaming in online commenting? It doesn't happen in our private networks of communication.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>12.38pm:</strong> Clift: We keep going more local and more local. Building real names in locality online is the real way of empowering citizens. Inclusion matters - citing Pew Internet and American Life Project statistics, Clift says we've got a problem with the \"most wired\" communities being the only ones online, those with less social capital missing out.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>12.42pm:</strong> Clift: If you really want to do inclusion online, you really have to get out there on the streets. A lot of people think if you build your online network, they will come - they won't at all. Everyone in every public space needs an online public space that matters.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>12.44pm:</strong> Clift: we can't wait for anyone to empower us. Anyone can start a neighbourhood online network tomorrow, we can't wait for government grants. We need to figure out how to bring together success stories of local networks. Without real inclusion and civility, \"Locals Online\"will destroy community, weaken democracy, and concentrate power.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> Professor Nigel Shadbolt, director, Web Science Trust &amp; The Web Foundation: From a UK perspective - what a difference a year makes with data. We've seen all sorts of public organisations all releasing data. We all know public data can make a difference.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>12.49pm:</strong> News flash: we've probably just had the best joke of the day, courtesy Nigel Shadbolt: \"Politics is dog eat dog. In academia it's the other way around.\"</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> Shadbolt: Nobody thought this dusty old spreadsheet was anything interesting - someone turned that into a top-selling iPhone app (Asborometer app).</p><p>We're beginning to see how previously unavailable data can be pulled together in interesting ways, breaking out of the old silos. <a href=\"http://Data.gov.uk\">Data.gov.uk</a> is hosting over 4,000 datasets - any one of those datasets could save somebody's day.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>12.57pm:</strong> Shadbolt: You will hear any number of excuses about why this can't happen - we've heard most of them, I suspect there are more to come. We have to settle a view about what we expect and how we expect this data to be produced and distributed. It should be free in most cases. We have seen examples of people who have to scrape their own site to release the data that we're after.</p><p>There are legitimate issues here about auditing and provenance. Our view is that governments produce data, data is a key asset, let's think about people producing the applications. This is an agenda to be radical - it's about democracy, transparency, accountability.</p><p>People in government, when given opportunity to cough up the data, are excited by that prospect.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>1.01pm:</strong> Shadbolt: This is information that can drive evidence-based policy. It's what drives our economic debates.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>1.01pm:</strong> Now for some US perspective. We have Beth Simone Noveck, deputy chief technology officer, United States and director, White House Open Government Initiative.</p><p>Noveck: US and UK engaged in a healthy race-to-the-top to see who can release most data.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>1.03pm:</strong> Noveck: There's a challenge to be audacious, to rethink the sacred cow of politics and democracy. We have the opportunity now to do government in new, better ways.</p><p>Assumption: people are smart, they have skills and ability to make a difference - we need to change how government institutions work to address how we do more with less money, innovate in the way we solve problems.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> Noveck: We're doing this new transparency through openness, empowering innovators. It's important to have a plan of what governments plan to do digitally over the coming years - including developing platforms for data etc.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>1.12pm:</strong> Noveck: We're looking at more projects involving data sharing and data with health, education. We can only do that with you telling us what data we need to release so we can get it out faster.</p><p>Participation - the Department of Energy opened a wiki for people to discuss energy sharing. We ask people to give input on policy before we draft the documents. Think of it as Mendeley for policy makers.</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>1.20pm:</strong>  We're breaking for lunch now, keep up with the programme for this afternoon <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/programme-2010\">here</a>. Keep up with <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?had_popular=true&amp;q=%23activate2010&amp;result_type=recent\">#activate2010 tweets here</a>.</p><p>Another aside: catch-up with Samia Hamid, co-founder of DataGiving.com, and her lightning presentation <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/147203-samia-hamid-co-founder-datagiving-com-at-activate2010\">here</a>. Hear Matt Stinchcomb, Europe director of Etsy, give his presentation <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/147207-matt-stinchcomb-europe-director-etsy-activate2010\">here</a>.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>1.25pm:</strong> Omidyar network announce grants of $1.2m to Global Voices, $575,000 to MySociety, and a grant XYZ Show.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>2.23pm:</strong> ...And we're back from lunch; stomachs filled, minds opened for an afternoon of expert insights from a real star-studded line-up of guests. </p><p>\"How will future generations shape tomorrow's world?\" - that's the wide-reaching question about to be tackled by the expert panel being chaired by Aleks Krotoski, Guardian columnist and presenter of the BBC's Virtual Revolution. On the panel we have Andrew Barron, chief operating officer of Virgin Media, Martha Lane-Fox, UK digital champion, Peter Sunde, founder of Flattr, and Jan Chipchase, executive creative director of global insights, Frog Design. On the Youth Panel, we have moderator Sam Conniff, founder of Livity chairs, with two Live magazine writers and two Virgin Media Pioneers.</p><p>Breakout session two is looking at how technology has (or has not) brought human individualism back to the fore. Moderating is Chris Thorpe, founder, Jaggeree. On the panel we have Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino, chief executive &amp; founder of Tinker, Mike Migurski, partner at Stamen, Matt Stinchcomb, Europe director at Etsy, and Matt Jones, BERG London.</p><p>The Omidyar sponsor session will look at technology and government transparency in the developing world. Moderated by Stephen King, senior director at Omidyar Network, with a panel including Gaurav Mishra, chief executive at Gauravonomics, Katrin Verclas, co-founder and editor, MobileActive.org, Juliana Rotich, co-founder and director of programmes at Ushahidi, and Ethan Zuckerman, founder of Global Voices.<br />Because we can't be everywhere at once (c'mon technology, sort it out), we recommend you search Twitter for the #activate2010 and include the surname(s) of the person/people you're interested in hearing from. For example, <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23activate2010+cascio\">#activate2010 + cascio</a>.</p><p>We're here at the expert panel, flanked by the youth panel of digital natives.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>2.33pm:</strong> Introducing the youth panel is Sam Conniff, founder of Livity. We have Sam Neter, founder hoopsfix.com, Bridget Minamore, contributor to Livity, Jamal Edwards, founder of sbtv, and Harriet Thomas, managing editor of iCaring.co.uk. These guys are super smart, the initiative is incredible.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> Krotoski, introducing her panel - dubbed \"Team Awesome\": David Cavallo, vice president and chief learning architect of One Laptop Per Child, Andrew Barron, chief operational officer of Virgin Media, Martha Lane-Fox, UK digital champion, Peter Sunde, founder of Flattr (formerly co-founder, The Pirate Bay), and Jan Chipchase, executive creative director of global insights, Frog Design.</p><p><strong>Opening remarks:</strong><br />Cavallo: The computer is the basis of real learning - and the best we've ever had. </p><p>Sunde: Everything in my life has come from an urge to share. Everything I've learned is from friends, family and copying.</p><p>Barron: People are beginning to live their life according to what their broadband power, their bandwidth, will allow. There's a larger unease amongst those that are not volunteers to this digital movement about what they're getting into, what they're being encouraged to share.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>2.46pm:</strong> Advice on how to make money online from Lane-Fox: A big dose of luck, she says. Nine out of 10 new businesses don't go anywhere, but those that are going somewhere have a founder that's doing something they love.</p><p>Barron says there's more opportunity now than there ever has been: the breadth of opportunity has never been at this rate, even in the life of the internet. It's the job of the experts to help the 'natives' make money.</p><p>Thomas says it's not just a pretty gadget that makes something successful, it's a persons confidence in the company. We are looking for the experts to give us their knowledge of how to get ideas out there, need to encourage start-ups.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>2.51pm:</strong> Thomas says money without direction (from the experts) is wasted. Experts would do well to offer support, contacts - more valuable than money. Edwards: I got a camera for Christmas and it just went from there. I was filming friends, then MCs saw them, then BBC saw them, then other important people saw them - all from YouTube.</p><p>Neter: Everyone can have their five minutes of fame, an instant audience, and it can just snowball. I never bothered with a business plan, the big turning point was reading Richard Branson's autobiography and the difference between talkers and doers. Make mistakes and learn from them. If you're producing content that people need, you've potentially got a huge audience there.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>2.56pm:</strong> Sundre: key thing with the internet is not technology, it's the low cost of it. It's the decentralisation, you just do it - don't ask anyone. The next level is thinking about the internet as an integral part of the world, not a separate virtual thing.</p><p>Minamore on online piracy: it's not feasible to police. Most of the stuff I listen to is underground music and LPs - most of these people have put stuff free online to download anyway, because it boosts their profile.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>3.02pm:</strong> Minamore: I don't see how it's theft, maybe because I've grown up with it. I'm scared of how newspapers are charging for content now.</p><p>Barron says there's a perception that the internet is free. The next big thing is what happens to video on the web, how we reconcile the perception that the internet is free. This could be a six-day seminar. </p><p>If you accept that the music is not in a good place right now: you say doing nothing isn't the answer right now. </p><p>Sunde: the semantics are wrong. Music is thriving - the record industry is struggling right now. Sharing is part of normal evolution and we shouldn't be scary of it. We've removed the middle-man, everyone can be their own record producer or film producer. Illegal downloading will exist forever - it can't be stopped, people don't want it to stop. We should move the conversation on to the next level.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> Cavallo: We're taught in school: you can't copy. But nobody learns sitting by themselves - you have to collaborate. We're very social beings, that's what we are. We shouldn't stifle creativity, collaboration or expression. As long as the price is so high - for music, software, films - then we're doing something wrong.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>3.13pm:</strong> Thomas: I know a whole load of people in Yorkshire who aren't online. In Whitby we don't have digital radio and broadband is super slow. It's about giving people confidence to train and approach the internet.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>3.17pm:</strong> Minamore on Edwards: it's a lot better to be the best on the web rather than mediocre on television. Edwards says he's \"in no rush\" to be on TV even though he's had offers. He's hot property and the web suits him fine, much to the enjoyment of fellow panelists.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>3.18pm:</strong> We've wrapped up here for now. Back after a 20 minute break for three different panel sessions. Once again, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/programme-2010\">here's the programme</a>. Stay tuned.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>3.46pm:</strong> For the next 50 minutes we're in a session on finding the web's voice: \"Activism, journalism and accountability in an online world\". Moderated by Juliana Rotich, co-founder and director of programmes at Ushahidi, the panel includes Sameer Padania, former Hub manager at Witness.org, Rufus Pollock, founder of The Open Knowledge Foundation, Turi Munthe, chief executive at Demotix, and Peter Sunde, founder of Flattr (formerly co-founder Pirate Bay).</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>3.52pm:</strong> Padania: We've been working with YouTube to improve miscategorisation of videos, and working with human rights organisations about the power of online video. What's next for The Hub? Sousveillance vs. surveillance; visual search and privacy; livecasting human rights; vicarious trauma online; ubiquitous video = overload?</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>3.55pm:</strong> Padania: we've never had access to unfiltered visual images of human rights abuses before. We need to watch what happens when people watch this content routinely.</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>4.00pm:</strong> Rufus Pollock, founder of The Open Knowledge Foundation, up now talking about his project called \"Where does my money go?\" - tracking exactly where every pound, euro, dollar of public money goes.</p><p>Why's this a big deal? Government spending in UK is 40% of GDP. And there are many misconceptions - including the amount spent on education and defence. The aim is to help people explore analyse and understand. \"Transparency, accountability and ownership - it's your government\".</p><!-- Block 62 --><p><strong>4.06pm:</strong> Pollock: This project requires lots of information and a lot of back-end work. Public finances are bloody complicated, it turns out - incomprehensible sums of money that are dotted around, disjointed and hard to track. Governments aren't that big on giving information out on what they're spending. Finding, requesting, then demanding the data is hard work. It took us eight months to get one database via FoI.</p><p>We have a data store which we want to open up to developers, those that want to dig in. We want people to make it personal and enable the community to contribute, annotate and clean up.</p><!-- Block 63 --><p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> Up now Turi Munthe, chief executive of Demotix, talking about the new \"new journalism.\" He says Demotix is trying to build a \"citizens wire\".</p><p>The first new journalism was Tom Wolfe in the 1960s - now the new \"new journalism\" speaks more as a conversation than a sermon.</p><!-- Block 64 --><p><strong>4.14pm:</strong> Munthe: Participatory news has stepped up to the plate to fill the holes of traditional media. It has not seeked to replace it, but many times has bettered it. Creationism is killing traditional media, not participatory media.</p><!-- Block 65 --><p><strong>4.17pm:</strong> Munthe says he adores live-blogging as a metaphor for new storytelling. He adores the Guardian's Andrew Sparrow Election Live blog - I hope he quite likes Josh Halliday's Activate Live blog too..</p><p>The simultaneous corrections and process of journalism published in live blogs talks to the fact that we're better and better readers. This makes a lot of people nervous because verification is an issue, but in this process we've all got far better at understanding what news is and getting involved in the conversation.</p><!-- Block 66 --><p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> Peter Sunde, founder of Flattr (co-founder, Pirate Bay), talking about The Pirate Bay and Flattr. There was no good option for Scandinavian filesharing when Napster what shut down, he says. We wanted an uncensored way for people to communicate. </p><p>We were stupid enough to not shut down the site when we got sued, instead we replied to these letters (probably two, three a week) saying they were going to sue us vast amounts of money. We sent back pictures of polar bears. They had no idea how to react.</p><!-- Block 67 --><p><strong>4.25pm:</strong> Then the Scandinavian politicians got involved, Sunde says. Police officers soon came and took away our computers - we got the system back up in three days and our profile grew and grew. We were running The Pirate Bay purely for fun. The political party now have two people in European Parliament.</p><p>The President of Brazil loves us, the US don't. \"Any problems,\" he said. \"You can just come through Brazil - we don't have extradition treaties\", claims Sunde.</p><p>We need to adopt to using new technology - use it or you'll go out of business. It's very important for people to share information - the laws today are only based on the current situation, not the future.</p><!-- Block 68 --><p><strong>4.27pm:</strong> Sunde: Flattr is my solution for how to share money on the internet - it's a flat rate, monthly fee, you click a button (like the Facebook Like button). We need to remove all the middlemen of the internet.</p><!-- Block 69 --><p><strong>4.36pm:</strong> Now: Where next for the web? \"Future technologies and their impact on society and humanity\" with Joe Cerrell, European director of The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Jan Chipchase, executive creative director of global insights of Frog Design, Desiree Miloshevic, board trustee at Internet Society, and Clay Shirky, professor of Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU. Quite a cast.</p><!-- Block 70 --><p><strong>4.47pm:</strong> Emily Bell opening the final session. Clay Shirky has had a \"laptop, water interface problem\" and will be along shortly.</p><!-- Block 71 --><p><strong>4.51pm:</strong> Joe Cerell, European director at Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation: Golden age of innovation with revolutionary technologies (iPad flashes up on screen to much laughter). Example of Haiti - 'mobile money' - not just technology itself it's how you use it.</p><!-- Block 72 --><p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> Cerell: we ask ourselves if we can leapfrog generations of traditional banking in Haiti - could we use mobile devices to send, receive and store money? How we could work with private sector to do this, we want to incentivise private sector in Haiti to address these challenges.</p><p>A mobile telephony system that would really encourage savings - we wanted more companies involved in looking at financial instruments for Haitians. Aim: to connect people to vital services. Also looked at fridge-free vaccines. The web will unlock a new generation of advocacy - forcing better transparency and better governance.</p><!-- Block 73 --><p><strong>4.59pm:</strong> Cerell: Working to think about new interfaces that can unlock valuable information into the hands of advocacy groups, research organisations, to help them work better. Project with the Guardian to act as a curator of content for advocacy interests. How the web itself can innovate in technology - the iJab?</p><p>Important to deliver better stories to convey success with what we're doing that affects people's daily lives: \"Living Proof\" - you rarely here about stories which ask \"what actually happened to that money?\" We want to be a portal of storytelling and help our partners to do that too.</p><!-- Block 74 --><p><strong>5.03pm:</strong> Jan Chipchase up now. The poor can least afford poorly designed products and services, says Chipchase.</p><p>Getting up a wristband on screen, Chipchase says this is the world's most emblematic symbol. The mobile phone, he says, is the second.</p><!-- Block 75 --><p><strong>5.10pm:</strong> Chipchase: around 1.1bn mobile devices are sold each year. There's a responsibility with handling mass-demand products, often overlooked. Mobiles are used globally in every context - how do you research that in a way that's legally, morally right? Where does the line between a product that needs to be global, and one that needs to be local, lie?</p><p>For global mobile companies, the cost of screwing up is amplified because the people that we're selling to are interactive and will tell people about it.</p><!-- Block 76 --><p><strong>5.15pm:</strong> Reputation has value, says Chipchase. Your reputation can be collateral as well, it can be taken away. How do you maintain that relationship when it can be taken away by other people? </p><p>Chipchase says he is constantly looking for leapfrog technologies for places like Afghanistan, where there's situations that haven't got technological solutions because most people haven't experienced them yet.</p><!-- Block 77 --><p><strong>5.18pm:</strong> KFC don't operate in Afghanistan, so people built Kabul Fried Chicken with signs made from real KFC vector graphics. @Pavlunka got <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/21ixqz\">a good Twitpic</a>.</p><!-- Block 78 --><p><strong>5.20pm:</strong> Chipchase closes: The poor can least afford poorly designed products and services - and now they know you know.</p><!-- Block 79 --><p><strong>5.23pm:</strong> Desiree Miloshevic, board trustee at Internet Society, now up. How should the internet be governed? And who decides? But who decides who decides? What will happen if we have a BP situation on the net? Who will be responsible?</p><!-- Block 80 --><p><strong>5.25pm:</strong> Miloshevic: the definition of \"internet governance\" is quite clumsy, but Wikipedia sums it up quite well. Largely internet governance is in the hands of the private sector, but it may not be always that way. We can see pendulum swinging back towards the public.</p><!-- Block 81 --><p><strong>5.30pm:</strong> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kevinmarks/statuses/17504204518\">@KevinMarks tweets</a>: \"says Désirée Miloshevič: Princess Bride - Internet is the princess, Wesley the biz, Sovereign the King\"</p><p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/publiczone/statuses/17504228552\">@Publiczone</a>: \"Loving the analogy b/n [between?] Internet governance and classic love triangle: pirate vs king. Who will win internet's heart?\"</p><!-- Block 82 --><p><strong>5.35pm:</strong> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/aleksk/statuses/17504424984\">@aleksk tweets</a>: \"Desiree Miloshevic is using The Princess Bride to explain the issues in the Internet Governance debate. Genius.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/bubana/statuses/17504473708\">@Bubana comments</a>: \"internet governance just got fun Internet is a young lady virtuous by design whose choice is dictator or a poor revolutionary\"</p><p>Asks Miloshevic: Is this a story without an end? We don't have to rush to a fairy-tale ending.</p><!-- Block 83 --><p><strong>5.38pm:</strong> Clay Shirky talking social media and futurology, \"cognitive surplus\". December 2007, disputed election in Kenya sparks ethnic violence, Kenyan government imposes media blackout - emphasising banning of live online conversation. </p><p>Blogger \"Kenyan Pundit\" was inundated with comments and information pointing to acts of violence etc. It was all too much to handle - then commenters pulled together. Seventy-two hours late Ushahidi was born.</p><!-- Block 84 --><p><strong>5.39pm:</strong> Shirky: Ushahidi has gone worldwide since then. What happened in Kenya would not have been possible without digital technology and human generosity.</p><!-- Block 85 --><p><strong>5.41pm:</strong> Shirky: Enormous increase in amount of free time available to us. In 20th century the amateurs got very good at consuming, and the professionals in the media got very good at producing. </p><p>An unscientific Shirky calculation: Wikipedia taken over 100,000,000 hours of human thought to put together. In the US we watch 200bn hours of TV ever year, a Wikipedia worth of TV every weekend is spent just watching ads.</p><!-- Block 86 --><p><strong>5.48pm:</strong> Shirky telling story of how a UNICEF student project was fast-tracked into use in Haiti to track missing people. Students - five of them - forced to go out immediately to developers and ask for a hand. Within weeks, the project turned into an international developer project. The speed with which this went from a mobile missing people design project to an international development operation is unbelievable. </p><p>Three observations on future of social media:</p><p>1) How random the future will be, widely spread infrastructure, servers, bandwidth, means that mass of participation, rather than depth of user-experience, is most headline-grabbing. In the technology world, we overfocus on needs and on the tech itself. It's not coming down to motive and opportunity.</p><p>2) Design through lack of viewers. People who are certain what will happen next try fewer things. People who are willing to learn through failure find solutions. Incremental public failure is leading to incremental public improvement.</p><p>3) Geographic spread - the action is shifting to the opportunities we can offer each other across borders. The amount of innovation we're seeing outside traditional innovation centres is heartening.</p><p>Future is getting harder to predict but easier to see. I hope we take advantage of these opportunities to innovate and collaborate.</p><!-- Block 87 --><p><strong>5.57pm:</strong> Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google up now. Schmidt: we spend a lot of time thinking about what's different. The internet is the most disruptive technology we've seen in history - replaced economics of scarcity with economics of abundance.</p><!-- Block 88 --><p><strong>5.58pm:</strong> Schmidt: what's really new now is the concept of \"nowness\". That's a big change for society as a whole. Nowness means life on the internet. All of us should start approaching the world with an internet-first strategy.</p><!-- Block 89 --><p><strong>6.00pm:</strong> Schmidt: interconnectedness of internet is also now leading to sense of connectiveness - a false sense of real relationships. Society will have to work that out. What do you lose when the internet stops working? A vast repository of information?</p><p>Mobile hottest area of technology today. The corollary of internet-first is mobile-first. Why? Because that's where the audience is. The smartest people I know are building mobile apps.</p><!-- Block 90 --><p><strong>6.04pm:</strong> Schmidt points to \"extraordinary growth\" of Apple iPad. These are scale markets of a size people do not appreciate. The news will become more personal because you'll be reading it on mobile devices - that brings questions about serendipity and narrowness of delivered vision.</p><!-- Block 91 --><p><strong>6.09pm:</strong> Schmidt: The overlooked point is that mobile is backed up by millions of computers. The power in the cloud gets very interesting. On Google translate: \"we now do over 160m translations online per day\". </p><p>The components of this that all matter are linked by networks. The rate of information generation is overwhelming, we've never seen anything like this. It gives you a sense of the scale of the challenge before us.</p><!-- Block 92 --><p><strong>6.12pm:</strong> Schmidt: This is a global phenomena with an awful lot of implications. How should you all behave in this situation? The future is more uncertain than ever. You should assume that content industries will have new ways that will make money, the rate this is happening is overwhelming. The best is really before us.</p><p>Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, opens questions.</p><!-- Block 93 --><p><strong>6.16pm:</strong> Schmidt on corporate altruism: We're not as subject as some of the real-term pressures that some of my colleagues might face. It's much easier to manage people who wake up saying \"I've just got to do this!\" </p><p>On 20% employee time to build own projects: it's an escape valve for the employee. The notion of this point is that you're going to be more creative with more control over your time. These projects are very significant projects with lots of people working on them, but started as 20% time projects.</p><!-- Block 94 --><p><strong>6.20pm:</strong> Schmidt: It's very tempting to try organise the chaos inside Google and the 20% time - but that's the essence of the company: \"what's next? What's next? What's next?\"</p><p>On trust: Every month of every year this will be the number one question to Google. It's the right question but won't be resolved by anything I say or do now. There are other companies collecting large amounts of date - the telephone companies, etc. The point is that the collection of this is a natural byproduct of how these products work. The wifi case was an error on our part and we 'fessed up.</p><!-- Block 95 --><p><strong>6.27pm:</strong> Schmidt: As long as we stay on the right side of the privacy line, and as long as our users have a choice, we'll be fine. Not only would our users leave us, but they'd leave us forever. We welcome transparency, it's the only way to run an information-type company. On YouTube we have a five-page policy on what we don't allow and why - the point is it's there.</p><p>Facebook and Google aren't that comparable - they're in different categories of information. People choose to search, people choose to upload pictures.</p><p>On newspapers: We're all very good friends [News International and Google]. We view ourselves as innovators. In the case of news, my argument is think internet-first. What does the news reading experience look like years from now? It'll be digital, of course. It will know what you've read. It will have sophisticated multimedia advertising products. It'll be highly personal - that's the most important think. That might narrow the field of view but we'll find some balance there.</p><!-- Block 96 --><p><strong>6.29pm:</strong> Schmidt: We want to enable paywall and non-paywall models. The current problem in the media industry: the analog rents are being replaced by small digital rents, people are losing their jobs and that's a very real problem. It's a very severe issue. Ultimately, revenue will eventually be higher because it'll be more personal.</p><!-- Block 97 --><p><strong>6.32pm:</strong> Schmidt: You should be able to over time build products that are more targeted and more lucrative, they're in a transitional period.</p><p>The paywall is a model we provide. Let's run this experiment globally and see what happens.</p><p>China: we needed a license to run our businesses there. The Chinese government has the ability to shut the Chinese Google down if they choose to, so far they have not. No coherent commercial business would have made the decision we made in Google China.</p><!-- Block 98 --><p><strong>6.37pm:</strong> Schmidt, now answering crowdsourced questions: Apple is a particular model of a closed ecosystem and that works for them, I'm saying that with respect. The alternative model, the one that Google opts for, works the other way. We'll end up with very beautiful products. We were built in the open way. This relentless drive in the mobile industry is good for everybody.</p><p>Google Wave? \"Still in development, still in use.\"</p><p>Google Me, true or false? \"That would be a product announcement and I won't say.\" [Rusbridger interjects to much laughter - \"that sounds like a yes\"] </p><p>Google Voice is on its way to the UK market, Schmidt confirms.</p><!-- Block 99 --><p><strong>6.40pm:</strong> Schmidt on print newspapers: the direction is going digital. All leading newspapers will have to have an internet strategy. The problem of monetisation online will be worked on together.</p><!-- Block 100 --><p><strong>6.58pm:</strong> Well that's it for another year. And what a success today has been. Guardian Activate will launch in New York in the winter - following departing director of digital content, Emily Bell, stateside. </p><p>Now to digest everything we've heard from today's array of speakers and delegates.

Tokyo is in second position, with Ndjamena in Chad in third place. Moscow is in fourth position followed by Geneva in fifth while Karachi is ranked as the world's least expensive city.  The survey found that Luanda is three times as costly as Karachi.<br /> <br />From the survey, London (rank 17) is the UK's most expensive city, followed by Aberdeen (149), Glasgow (155), and Birmingham (158). Belfast (182) is ranked as the UK's least expensive city. <br /> </p><blockquote><p>The survey covers 214 cities across five continents and measures the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, including housing, transport, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. New York is used as the base city for the index and all cities are compared against New York. The cost of housing – often the biggest expense for expats - plays an important part in determining where cities are ranked.</p></blockquote><p>There's some great country comparisons below.

phones bring revolution to developing world ","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-18T10:07:27Z","sectionId":"activate","id":"activate/phones-revolution-developing-world","fields":{"body":"<p>We all know how fast technology can change markets and businesses. Now the web and the mass proliferation of mobile phones, as well as falling costs for all kinds of technologies, are allowing rapid change to affect more than just the developed world.   </p><p>And advances in technology and the falling cost of delivery are driving big corporations as well as entrepreneurs to take new or renewed interest in solving some of the most seemingly intractable issues we face as a global community, from health care to education, from economic development and rolling out affordable alternative energy to coping with the social and economic fallout from natural disasters.  </p><p>Even non-governmental organisations (NGOs), many of which not claim to be particularly skilled in technology, are catching on, using it both in field work and in publicising what they do. </p><p>In some ways technological advances will happen first in the developing world because there are less entrenched interests in the way. There is, for example, a free software program called <a href=\"http://www.episurveyor.org/user/index\">episurveyor</a> that allows health workers in Kenya to track disease outbreaks more efficiently using web-based data-gathering tools on their mobile phones. It has been embraced by Kenya's ministry of health, but it is unlikely to enter developed markets so quickly.  </p><p>The same pattern can be seen in alternative energy technologies. A year ago Alcatel Lucent ramped up its work by making cellular telephone sites in areas off the electricity grid affordable for its mobile operator clients. \"The big driver is to bring telecoms beyond the electricity grid to reach the 1 billion people who are famous for being outside the reach of telecommunications,\" says Frederic Wauquiez, marketing director of Alcatel Lucent's alternative energy programme. \"It's not a telecoms challenge. It is an energy challenge.\"  </p><p>Alcatel Lucent now sees producing alternative energy for telecoms as a strategic imperative and a moral one in terms of reducing the carbon footprint of the telecoms industry. Recent strides in solar and wind power technology mean the return on investment makes them cheaper than running diesel engine-powered generators or avoiding certain remote, off-the-grid areas altogether.</p><p>\"We're done with the stone age and the pioneering stuff in alternative energy,\" says Wauquiez. \"We are now talking about large-scale rollouts.\"  </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-363884676'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2010/06/17/2-lead140x200.jpg' alt='Alcatel Lucent wind and solar technology on a cell site in Qatar' width='140' height='200' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Alcatel Lucent wind and solar technology on a cell site in Qatar</figcaption></figure><p>Cellular mobile phone transmission towers in emerging markets will be the first to benefit from alternative energy – they are cheaper to build than laying down landlines – which helps explain why mobile phone use is outpacing landline use in the developing world. Landlines will also adopt alternative power but at a slower pace depending on the country, predicts Alcatel Lucent. </p><p>\"As the technology evolves, as we do a better job at integrating and the price of electricity from the grid becomes more expensive - and it will - this technology will also become applicable in grid-connected situations and for all type of networks, wireless and wireline,\" he says. \"It's not just emerging markets but all markets. We built this programme with this in mind.\"  </p><p>The proliferation of technology tools that individuals can afford is changing how quickly new ways of doing things can be developed and rolled out. \"We haven't even begun to realise what it means when every health worker, every schoolteacher, when literally everyone has a connection to the internet,\" says Joel Selanikio, MD, assistant professor at Georgetown University's Department of Pediatrics and also the co-founder of DataDyne, the company that created Episurveyor software being used in Kenya. \"People underestimate the effects this change is having. I think it will rival the printing press for its effects on society.\"  </p><p>Episurveyor itself has been transformed in the last year, moving from being a Windows download to Palm Pilots to a Web-based app that works on almost any mobile phone. \"Five years ago I was trying to figure out how to afford to buy Palm Pilots for all the health workers we wanted to reach in Africa,\" says Selanikio. \"But then everyone ran out and got a mobile phone. This has been transformational.\"  </p><p>Since episurveyor became a web application, its business has exploded with 2,000 downloads across 120 countries. With a company staff of just 10, this growth wouldn't have been possible if the software wasn't easy to use.</p><p>\"This many users in a year is a record for international development software,\" says Selanikio. \"I don't even know most of the people who have downloaded it because it is user-friendly and doesn't require us to send a programmer in to make it work… If you really want to free the health workers in countries to be able to assess their health situation there is nothing more powerful than making it a web app as easy to set up as a Googlemail account.\"  </p><p>The ability to reach more people more easily and directly through technology is also supporting the work iundertaken by the overseas aid charity, Oxfam. Taking its cue from the blogging tent at the US Democratic conference in 2008, and working with several other organisations including Save the Children, the Voice Project was developed for the G20 Summit in London last year.</p><p>The idea was to bring 50 hand-picked bloggers to the summit so that coverage of the global financial crisis would include the impact on people living in poverty. \"I saw we could engage our existing supporters and wider audiences on the issues that mattered to our organisations through the discussions and debates that bloggers were having online, \"says Karina Brisby, head of interactive campaigns at Oxfam GB.</p><p>\"Not only did we get a lot of coverage on the issues that are important to us but the mainstream media were interested in them (the bloggers) as well…We only got permission to do this one month before the summit but we polled the web to tell us who they wanted to represent them.\"  </p><p>Oxfam has put its message onto Facebook, where it has 20,000 fans, and on Twitter where the charity has 10,000 followers. This month it has set up a participation video on YouTube called <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/pressoffice/?p=13094\">Don't Drop the Ball.com</a> to try and capitalise on the World Cup but also to raise the profile of issues that could lead to the end of poverty and injustice.</p><p>In July Oxfam will unveil a new digital monitoring and outreach programme that better uses the Web. \"We are moving from a broadcast mode of: here is what we stand for, to one where there is more space for people to also have a conversation with us as well,\" says Brisby. \"Oxfam isn't anything if people don't support it.\" </p><h2>Weblinks</h2><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/alternative-energy/\">alcatel-lucent.com/alternative-energy/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.episurveyor.org/user/index\">episurveyor.org/user/index</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/?ito=1482\">oxfam.org.uk/?ito=1482</a></strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/information-power\">Return to the home page for more technology for social change</a></h2>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2010/06/17/2-lead-300x180.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/activate/phones-revolution-developing-world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/activate/phones-revolution-developing-world","sectionName":"Activate"},{"webTitle":"Mobile phone networks champion social change in the developing world","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-18T10:07:27Z","sectionId":"activate","id":"activate/mobile-networks-social-change-third-world","fields":{"body":"<p>Information has always been a source of power, but when mobile phones were first invented, few could have predicted that this technology would become a workhorse to create social change in developing and rural communities where modern-day infrastructures are weak or non-existent.</p><p>Services ranging from money transfers to weather reports and from medical tips to agriculture prices are being made available in emerging countries for small micro-payments.</p><p>While some philanthropic organisations, non-government organisations (NGOs) and national governments are operating free initiatives in countries such as Kenya and China to help stamp out poverty and improve rural communities, the mobile phone players believe their services are sustainable simply because they need to succeed commercially. Their free-market strategy is to provide crucial, personalised information to millions of people – mostly those outside urban areas – and that the sheer volume of micro-payments will lead to profit and better services.</p><p>Katrin Verclas, co-founder and editor of <a href=\"http://www.MobileActive.org\">MobileActive.org</a>, a website that monitors mobile technology used for social change, says the most successful commercial mobile projects aimed at the developing world will be hybrids, where commercial operators partner with NGOs and governments.</p><p>\"This is a growing market and, while it is perfectly acceptable for companies to have business models that provide data for small payments, the various groups need to work together,\" says Verclas from her base in New York.  \"I don't think any of the commercial players have quite figured this out yet, but they will ultimately need a holistic approach with some information provided for free.\"</p><p>She holds up Vodafone's M-pesa money transfer service - originally launched in Kenya in 2007 - as a good example of how an international commercial giant has used local cultural knowledge and partners to succeed.  So far 11 million customers have used M-pesa (the word is derived from the Swahili for \"cash\").</p><p>Understanding that Kenya is a country where the principal wage earner often lives away from home for months on end, Vodafone worked with local mobile operator Safaricom, Citibank and the Commercial Bank of Africa to allow M-pesa users to send money safely and cheaply to their families without a time-consuming journey home. M-pesa also allows users to make cash withdrawals and loan repayments all using mobile phone technology.</p><p>\"Before M-pesa, husbands were sending home cash in envelopes which was dangerous or transferring money via Western Union telegraphs which was expensive,\" says Caroline Dewing, senior strategy manager for Vodafone Group.  \"We priced M-pesa competitively and guaranteed that the money would get to families safely through 15,000 local agents, many in village communities.\" Meanwhile, Safaricom claims as many as 30,000 new jobs have been created by the service.</p><p>Success in Kenya has led Vodafone to roll out M-pesa with local partners in Tanzania, Afghanistan and, most recently, South Africa.</p><p>Another mobile player crossing borders with similar mobile services is Nokia, which launched its Ovi Life Tools information service in India last year for agriculture and education as well as entertainment services, including astrology, ringtones and even movie news.  The service has since moved into Indonesia and, more recently, China and added health care information to its offering.</p><p>Up to 1.5 million people have used Ovi Life Tools in the last 12 months, with agriculture and education information being the most popular. Subscribers pay the equivalent of less than $1 a month for constant agricultural information, while other services – such as learning English language - are around 50 cents a month each.</p><p> \"We have teams of experts providing information on many subjects, so we complement what NGOs and governments are doing,\" says Jawahar Kanjilal, Ovi Nokia Life Tools global head of emerging market services. \"We provide a personalised information and it is available 24/7.  The NGOs cannot be in every village every day. Also, we provide more than what they can give.\"</p><p>Nokia was originally a partner on the Reuters Market Light project, which concentrates on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/mobile-phone-indian-farmers-hope\">information relevant to farmers</a>, but Nokia wanted to offer more than just agricultural information and had a roll-out plan for other countries. \"Ovi Life Tools is a good example of public and private partnership,\" says Kanjilal. \"Ministries in India and Indonesia support us because our advice follows the practices of each industry and is sustainable.\" </p><p>Nokia won't disclose financial details nor subscriber numbers but it is clear that Ovi Life Tools and, indeed, the similar mobile information offerings have barely scratched the surface of their potential.  For example, Nokia moved its services into China only last month and believes some 732 million rural residents are possible customers, while it is likely to start up in Africa in 2011, with the potential to attract hundreds of millions more potential subscribers. </p><h2>Weblinks</h2><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.mobileactive.org\">mobileactive.org</a> </p><p><a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/index.php?id=745\">safaricom.co.ke/index.php?id=745</a> <br /><a href=\"http://www.http://conversations.nokia.com/tag/farmers/\"><br />http://conversations.nokia.com/tag/farmers/</a></strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/activate/information-power\">Return to the home page for more technology for social change</a></h2>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2010/06/17/3-lead-300x180.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/activate/mobile-networks-social-change-third-world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/activate/mobile-networks-social-change-third-world","sectionName":"Activate"},{"webTitle":"Field of Dreams: Bringing tech and football to Africa","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/pda/2010/jun/18/kilifi-world-cup","fields":{"body":"<p>There are few computers in Kilifi, a small town 30 miles north of Kenya's capital Mombasa on the Indian Ocean.

Anat Amir, head of marketing for Africa, has been in Kilifi and said a prerequisite for the project was that the girls would continue to be supported after the end of the project. \"We didn't want to do this like a spaceship landing, showing them an amazing technology and then going again. That makes no sense and no impact,\" she said. The ICT equipment is being left with Moving the Goalposts, who have a base in Kilifi, but there will also be an ongoing relationship between the project and Google's office in Mombasa. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-363867282'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/6/17/1276815146035/glow18jun2010.jpg' alt='Stuart Farmer/Open Air Cinema' width='460' height='307' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Stuart Farmer/Open Air Cinema</figcaption></figure><p><br />When Ghana beat Serbia on 13 June, Amir was one of 1,500 people watching the match on the giant inflatable screen in Kilifi, and before the match the crowd watched videos about the girls' training. </p><p>In the crowd was Lilian Nbeyu, who never thought when she left school to have a baby at 16 that she would be able to go back to education. But with strong  support from her family and friends, she managed to finish school and  joined Moving the Goalposts as a trainer. Now heading up training, Forde says Nbeyu is an impressive and inspiring leader in her community, where she would have been a single mother with limited opportunities.</p><p>As for the technology, it's mobile that creates the most excitement. Most of the girls have access to a phone through someone in their family, and the growth of mobile payment services has been a step change for many Kenyans. And while ICT training might not directly lead to work with so few opportunities, it does start to show the possibilities for information that can be accessed online, whether education, politics or health.<br /></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/jun/18/kilifi-world-cup","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/pda/2010/jun/18/kilifi-world-cup","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"Kenya paves way for GM crops after decade of controversy","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-17T09:34:01Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2010/jun/17/kenya-gm-crops","fields":{"body":"<p>Kenya's long-awaited biosafety law is likely to become operational this month — well over a year after its president approved the legislation.</p><p>President Mwai Kibaki signed off parliament's approval of the biosafety legislation in February 2009, after a decade of controversy about the advisability of allowing the commercialisation of genetically modified organisms.</p><p>Last month, agriculture minister William Ruto confirmed that the biosafety guidelines had been finalised.

Farm-Africa, a partner in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/sep/23/background.news\">Guardian's Katine project</a>, estimates that there are more than 12 million pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in Ethiopia and Kenya alone.

It looks like the donor community and national governments have given up on these kinds of people - [they think] there's no hope and it's pointless investing in them. What we're saying is this is not true. Farm-Africa invests in these kinds of people and doing so in the right way can improve yields and incomes and they can lift themselves out of poverty in a dignified manner.\"</p><p>The group would like to see the government support more \"safety-net\" welfare programmes, an idea that shouldn't be new to Mitchell, as he promised in a Conservative green paper on international development last year that \".... we will act to strengthen social safety-nets, particularly for children\".</p><p>Mitchell made a number of comments about agriculture during his time on the opposition bench. For example, he spoke about the importance of private sector led growth and wealth creation as a path to prosperity and investment in low cost rainwater collection and irrigation systems. If the minister needs reminding of any of his promises, Keith Palmer, executive chairman of <a href=\"http://www.agdevco.com/\">AgDevCo</a>, will be on hand to do so. When we met last week, Palmer handed me a list of Mitchell's top lines.</p><p>AgDevCo is a not-for-profit company that develops and arranges finances for sustainable agriculture and agri-business opportunities in Africa. With its focus on business development, it is perhaps less focused on the groups to which Peacock refers, but he is no less passionate about the importance of agriculture in  changing the world – and  he believes the key to achieving this is investment in irrigation.</p><p>\"If you're really serious, you've got to sort out irrigation. It solves the problem of famine when rains go away. It's been a persistent problem in Africa for a long time. It's not just that we can massively improve yields and production, you can two-crop and in some parts of Africa you can triple crop.  You improve nutrition and health. It's so obvious to me that it's depressing that there is almost no irrigation systems in Africa – except in south and north Africa,\" he told me last week.</p><p>The reason for this apparent lack of interest is, he says, is money. He estimates that the cost of installing irrigation infrastructure is, on average, US$7,000 per hectare. (Although organisations like <a href=\"http://www.ideorg.org/\">International Development Enterprises (IDE)</a>, which champions small-scale irrigation schemes to farmers living on $1 a day, would no doubt argue you can do it for much less.)</p><p>\"You've got to create irrigation agriculture businesses to pay for the cost of all that, but it's not a government priority.\"</p><p>At an event organised by AgDevCo last week, delegates called on governments and donors to support a major increase in resources for sustainable and pro-poor agricultural initiatives in Africa, and to channel a greater share of the budget towards NGOs.</p><p>\"I hope that we can get this message across about agriculture production being the single best thing we can do to help the rural poor. Let's look at effective ways to do this. Let's put some commitment behind it. If you want quick wins you're not going to get it [with agriculture], but this is the way to go,\" Palmer says.</p><p>The UK government has already been vocal in its support for women in developing countries, focusing on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jun/03/aid-developing-world-targeted-money\">a reduction in maternal mortality rates</a>. But it has been tight-lipped so far on agriculture - a sector in which women make up around 70% of the workforce in many parts of Africa – except to include the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the International Fund for Agriculture and Development (IFAD) in its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jun/09/aid-review-targets-multilateral-agencies\">review of spending on multilateral aid</a>.</p><p>In January, a report published by the All Party Parliamentary Group on agriculture and food for development, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2010/jan/28/food-security-parliamentary-report\">Why no thought for food?</a>, was heavily critical of the Department for International Development (DfID) for neglecting agriculture. It called on the UK government to commit at least 10% of its overseas aid budget to farming. At the time Mitchell called the report \"hard-hitting\" and said: \"Improving food security for the world's poorest people is a matter of life or death, and should be an important part of our international development efforts.\"</p><p>Let's see how that plays out in practice.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/katine-chronicles-blog/2010/jun/15/support-smallholder-farmers","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/katine/katine-chronicles-blog/2010/jun/15/support-smallholder-farmers","sectionName":"Katine"},{"webTitle":"UNHCR refugee statistics: full data, as a spreadsheet","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-14T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2010/jun/15/refugee-statistics-unhcr","fields":{"body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home\">UN's High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)</a> releases its annual global report, <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/search?page=search&amp;docid=4a37c9076&amp;query=2008%20global%20statistics#hit3%23hit3\">Global Trends</a>, today - which this year shows the highest numbers of displaced people worldwide since the 1990s. This means there are now 43.3m people forcibly displaced around the world - including: 27.1m internally displaced people (IDP) and 15.6m refugees.</p><p>Those refugee numbers have dropped a negligible amount, but a 4% rise in people displaced within their own country and a huge fall in returning refugees - to the lowest level in 20 years - means overall numbers are up.</p><p>Simply put, as conflicts rumble on, those who fled the initial fighting cannot safely return until the gunfire falls silent.</p><p>The key drivers of these trends are continuing conflicts in countries such as Afghanistan, Somalia and the Congo, Democratic Republic of and as-yet-unresolved situations in places such as Iraq and Sudan. Colombia's 3.3 million internally-displaced persons is the highest in the world, with African nations accounting for 40% of the world's internally-displaced population. </p><p>Most interesting, perhaps, is the rubbishing of so-called conventional wisdom with regards to refugee relocation.

Pakistan leads the way, with 1.7 million, and Iran and Syria, at just over 1 million each, make up the podium. The US and the UK?

great tragic side-effect of conflict and upheaval around the world: the thousands of unaccompanied children who somehow get to the UK to claim asylum each year.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jun/07/child-asylum-seekers-uk-afghanistan\">latest reports</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/\">UK Border Agency</a> is to set up a £4m \"reintegration centre\" in Afghanistan so that it can start deporting unaccompanied child asylum seekers to Kabul from Britain - to the alarm of refugee groupslike the <a href=\"http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/\">Refugee Council</a>.</p><p>Alan Travis writes today:</p><blockquote><p>The terms of the official tender for the centre show that immigration officials initially hope to forcibly return 12 boys a month aged under 18 to Afghanistan and provide \"reintegration assistance\" for 120 adults a month.</p><p><a href=\"http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration-asylum-stats.html\">Home Office</a> figures show there are more than 4,200 unaccompanied child asylum seekers in Britain, with most being supported in local authority social services homes. Those from Afghanistan are the largest group. Of the 400 minors claiming asylum in the first three months of this year, almost half were Afghans.</p></blockquote><p>Here are the official figures from the Home Office showing where unaccompanied

It was therefore interesting to me that some of the recurring comments following an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/apr/28/electoralreform-houseofcommons\" title=\"Cif: UK democracy has upper hand on US\">article</a> written by Abdulrahman El-Sayed weren't so much based on the content of his writing, but on his status as a Rhodes scholar aspiring to work in public health policy.</p><p></p><p>As a fellow Rhodes scholar and an African woman, I frequently get asked why, in the face of Rhodes's bloody and destructive quest to subjugate an entire generation of my people, I would accept money from a trust set up in his name. Why would I study at a university whose history is so intertwined with the legacy of colonial oppression, in a country that has never truly made peace with the atrocities perpetuated in the name of the empire?</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, the legacy of the <a href=\"http://www.rhodesscholar.org/\" title=\"Rhodes Scholarships\">Rhodes scholarships</a> speaks to the heart of the legacy of empire in general, and the short answer to all the questions raised above is: it's complicated. For many Africans, accepting any perceived largesse derived directly from the proceeds of colonialism is an agonising process. I very nearly didn't. I genuinely believe that the legacy of colonialism is to blame for so many of the woes facing the African continent today, and that former colonising countries can and should do more to address the global inequality that was built on the backs of slavery and colonialism.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, what's the alternative? When I graduated, I had planned to take 10 years off – and this was the optimistic estimate – to work and save up to do a master's degree. There is no other way on this earth that I would ever have been able to afford to come to Oxford without this scholarship. Would it have served Kenya better if I hadn't accepted this scholarship? In the one year that I've been here, I've met and talked with Nobel prize winner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/mar/31/society.politics\" title=\"Guardian: Amartya Sen profile\">Amartya Sen</a> about his position on entitlements and how this relates to development policy in Africa; discussed the quantification of fear in the planning of organisations working in conflict regions with former UN special representative to Afghanistan, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakhdar_Brahimi\" title=\"Wikipedia: Lakhdar Brahimi\">Lakhdar Brahimi</a>; I've questioned the chief financial officer at Google, <a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=652479&amp;ticker=GOOG:US\" title=\"Bloomberg: Patrick Pichette profile\">Patrick Pichette</a>, about his company's policy in Africa. Would any of these things have been possible if I hadn't been at Oxford?</p><p></p><p>As an education activist myself, I recognise that the monopoly universities in the west have on quality of education is, in part, derived from perpetuating inequalities in access to information, cornering the market on high-quality facilities and pricing universities in the developing world out of the market for quality educators. Would my turning down this scholarship have done anything to address these structural issues? Or am I better placed to understand these issues more and work towards addressing them now that I know first-hand how the system works?</p><p></p><p>This relates the question of what being a Rhodes scholar really involves. I assure you that it is not the same as receiving a blank cheque at the end of every month. Many of us arrive in Oxford with the expectations of families, friends and some even entire countries piled upon our shoulders. That level of expectation can be all at once enthralling and frustrating.</p><p></p><p>Just ask <a href=\"http://myronrolle.com/\" title=\"Myron Rolle website\">Myron Rolle</a> what it's like to have ESPN follow you around for one day, asking you if accepting the scholarship spelt the end of your career as a professional American football player. Or another scholar what it's like to run a charity based in Sri Lanka, primarily funded in the US, while studying full time in Oxford. Or another, who's looking into developing technology that would revolutionise the way disabled people in India are able to access information, what it's like to wonder if the technology will translate in India. Or ask yours truly, the first woman in her family to graduate from university and start a master's degree what it's like to choose between doing a DPhil and starting your own organisation or finally getting a real job.</p><p></p><p>Every decision you make suddenly takes on a weight that you had previously never ever had to consider. For me, being a Rhodes scholar is not a mark of accomplishment. It's a step towards something bigger, a platform from which I can launch into bigger and better things in the future. It's a comma, not a full-stop. But it's also a responsibility. A recognition that so much has been given to me and so much more will be expected of me.</p><p></p><p>One of the best answers to the original question was given by one of the wonderful students that I met when I arrived.

This will mean a three-day shortfall in the supply of certain products, including asparagus, grapes, green onions, lettuce and pre-packed fruit salads. The fear is that, while there are still supplies of these products in the supply chain, they are likely to be exhausted next week.</p><p>Parcel delivery firms are also suffering because of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/apr/16/volcanic-ash-cloud-grounds-planes\" title=\"the flight ban\">the flight ban</a>, which is estimated to be costing the global airline industry more than $200m (£130m) per day.</p><p>All the major supermarkets insisted today that their shelves were still well-stocked but gaps could start appearing on shelves if normal service is not resumed soon at UK airports. Some of the pre-packaged fruit that appears on the shelves is prepared, cut and packaged overseas and then flown into the UK, predominantly into Heathrow.</p><p>Waitrose has said that the supply of \"a handful\" of products had been hit, including fresh pineapple chunks from Ghana and baby sweetcorn from Thailand. At Tesco, Thai orchids are likely to be the first item to vanish from stores if the disruption continues.</p><p>The UK imports about 90% of its fruit and 60% of its vegetables. While the vast majority come by sea – Fair Trade bananas from the West Indies, for instance, are regularly delivered to Southampton and Portsmouth – some of the more exotic inhabitants of the UK's shops come by air.</p><p>Air freight makes up about 25% of all British imports by value, but just 0.5% of all imports by weight. But while a diamond ring will not tarnish if it waits a few extra days before being delivered, some of the goods shipped by air are going to be in a poor state if the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland continues to spew hot ash into the atmosphere. Customers, meanwhile, will begin to run out of their existing supplies. Many of Britain's supermarkets operate their supply chains incredibly tightly, using the principle of \"just in time\" delivery. When disaster strikes, shortages of some items can start appearing within a few days.</p><p>\"Some fruit, veg and flower lines do arrive by air,\" said a spokesperson for Marks &amp; Spencer. \"However at this stage we are not expecting any supply problems, but we are of course keeping a close eye on the situation.\"</p><p>Waitrose confirmed that there had been disruption to supplies of some items, including exotic fruits, but insisted that the disruption has been \"very, very minimal\". Both Tesco and Sainsbury's said they are monitoring the situation.</p><p>But it is not just fruit and vegetables that are being held up by the ash cloud. Flowers are also frequent flyers. Holland is home to the biggest flower market in the world and already some Dutch flower wholesalers are reporting a lack of various types of orchid, which are typically flown in from the Far East. Shipments of roses from Kenya have also stalled and if the effective blockade of Europe's airports continues for too long it could represent a serious economic headache for the east African country. The flower trade is one of Kenya's largest generators of foreign earnings after tourism, tea and coffee, and Europe is its largest market with almost two-thirds of its flowers bound for Holland – and from there all over the world – while a quarter come straight into the UK.</p><p>A spokesman for the Flower Council of Holland said Kenyan roses tend to be sold in the mass market. \"A lot of the Kenyan roses will probably go to the supermarket trade,\" he said.</p><p>A flight carrying flowers for Waitrose to the UK was redirected to Luxemberg airport, where they were unloaded and brought into the UK.</p><p>In fact, about 70% of the air freight that comes into the UK is carried in the baggage hold of passenger aircraft. \"It's not just your luggage that is rattling around under your feet in a 747,\" explained a spokeswoman for the Freight Transport Association. \"Air freight tends to be perishable goods and high-value items, so everything from jewellery to pharmaceuticals is down there.\"</p><p>As for less perishable freight, the large logistics companies such as FedEx and DHL use regional airports such as Stansted and East Midlands International, and all flights are grounded. DHL said it expects significant service disruptions on several European air traffic routes, due to the temporary closing of air space through national authorities in northern Europe and parts of western Europe. It said it is monitoring the situation closely and will process shipments in the affected regions as soon as possible.</p><p>Alan Braithwaite, chairman of LCP Consulting and visiting professor at Cranfield, said: \"If this disruption lasts for another four or five days then there will be selective shortages. The air freight sector, which is just starting to bounce back from a crippling recession, will undoubtedly experience more losses. There have been recent bankruptcies, so if this disruption lasts it will be seriously detrimental to the air freight sector.\"</p><p>Braithwaite reckons the disruption will quite quickly lead to shortages in categories such as fresh fruit and flowers, before causing shortages for other items such as pharmaceuticals and high technology items, based on limited stock in the chain. One possible casualty of the air blockade will be British geeks who ordered an iPad from the US, shipping it through specialist companies such as Reading-based Bundlebox, which allows Britons to register for a US postal address, in order to avoid Apple's embargo on international sales.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2010/4/16/1271433345972/Grounded-planes-Belfast-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/16/flight-ban-shortages-uk-supermarkets","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/apr/16/flight-ban-shortages-uk-supermarkets","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Police reinvestigate Julie Ward murder in Kenya","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-13T09:46:31Z","sectionId":"uk-news","id":"uk/2010/apr/13/police-reinvestigate-julie-ward-murder","fields":{"body":"<p>A team from the Metropolitan police has spent 10 days in Kenya reinvestigating the brutal unsolved murder of Julie Ward, whose mutilated body was found in 1988 at a campsite in the Masai Mara game reserve.</p><p>Ward, from Bury St Edmunds, who worked as a publishing assistant but was also a passionate wildlife photographer, was last seen alive on 6 September, 1988.</p><p>A week later when scattered and charred remains were first found, the Kenyan authorities initially insisted she had been killed by wild animals.</p><p>When prosecutions were eventually brought, two murder trials of game reserve rangers ended in the acquittal of all those accused.</p><p>John Ward, Julie's father and a retired hotelier, has never allowed the case to be dropped.

from Africa: Tweet dreams are made of this","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-12T10:53:35Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2010/apr/12/david-smith-letter-from-africa-tweets","fields":{"body":"<p>I never imagined I would spend my first anniversary as a South African resident watching a fellow British journalist get marching orders from a press conference with the words \"bastard\" and \"bloody agent\" ringing in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Nor did I expect my 999th contribution to Twitter to be sent from a funeral where Nazi-style swastikas and apartheid era flags were de rigueur, black journalists were heckled as \"kaffirs\" and \"baboons\" and mourners expressed their grief with a salute perfected in 30s Nuremberg.</p><p></p><p>I took comfort from a sense that, somewhere between these extremes, there were millions of South Africans working, shopping, laughing, watching television, making love and, in a small but growing minority, tweeting.</p><p></p><p>Twitter last week rapidly became a focal point of discussion and debate about both <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/08/anc-julius-malema-bbc-journalist\" title=\"\">Julius Malema's notorious outburst</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/09/eugene-terreblanche-south-africa-funeral\" title=\"\">Eugene Terre'Blanche's gory demise</a>.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/JonahFisher\" title=\"\">Jonah Fisher, a BBC journalist</a>, demonstrated that being on the receiving end of Malema's audition for The Last King of Scotland sequel can do wonders for your Twitter career.</p><p></p><p>Hours after being ejected by the African National Congress youth league president, Fisher tweeted: \"Forced out of ANCYL meeting and called a bastard by Julius Malema. What did I do? Pointed out that he lives in Sandton … After he'd launched into a tirade about Mickey Mouse opposition in Zimbabwe speaking from 'airconditioned Sandton' not Mashonaland.\"</p><p></p><p>That evening Fisher added: \"Crazy day. Thanks for all the nice messages. Now at the church in Ventersdorp for Terreblanche funeral tmrw.\"</p><p></p><p>And later: \"ANCYL have issued a statement inviting me to apologise. Hhm....\"</p><p></p><p>The following day, Fisher tweeted again: \"Funeral over. The heavens have opened. And the ANC have told Malema to apologise. Waiting for the phone to ring.\"</p><p></p><p>All of this brought him more than a thousand new fans on the social networking website. Fisher, who started tweeting only in January, quickly surpassed my own tally of 788 followers and now has almost double that number.</p><p></p><p>Many gave messages of support. The user absurdking wrote: \"Jonah Fisher, hats off to you. For being a damn good journalist, and covering real issues. We applaud you.\"</p><p></p><p>Another, ilseposselt, posted: \"Jonah Fisher, in my (granted, somewhat limited view) you have officially reached hero status!\"</p><p></p><p>ryanrich001 said: \"My support as a South African is completely behind you, and I can't believe how rude that arrogant little nothing was!\"</p><p></p><p>There was dissent from jamesrobinson00, who told Fisher: \"You should stayed there and given the little shit some serious uphill – not walk out like a scolded child! backbone?\"</p><p></p><p>But he gained an admirer in tarrynharbour: \"Jonah Fisher is kinda cute :))\"</p><p></p><p>Malema himself appears to have more than one Twitter identity, but the youth league has pointed out they are all fakes. Its spokesman, Floyd Shivambu, said recently: \"It's set up by people who are crazy, people who are mad, and we have no interest in that.\"</p><p></p><p>But people are tweeting across Africa, particularly in South Africa and Kenya. Every day I see messages from aid agencies, embassies, marketing firms, media organisations, NGOs, politicians, journalists, citizen journalists and countless others with access to phone or computer. In countries such as Zimbabwe, it has become one more valuable weapon in the war against state censorship.</p><p></p><p>For foreign correspondents on the road, Twitter has come at a time when mobile phone coverage is expanding into the unlikeliest corners.

Robyn Dixon, who reports on Africa for the Los Angeles Times, often tweets postcard impressions from her travels.</p><p>Here are some nuggets from her visit last month to Nigeria: \"inside a nigeria govt office: desks and computers numbered in white paint.

In January Gregg Coppen, from Cape Town, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/13/cape-town-giant-shark-attack\" title=\"\">witnessed a shark attack</a> from his bedroom window. He instinctively reached for his phone and tweeted: \"Holy shit, we just saw a gigantic shark eat what looked like a person in front of our house in fishhoek. Unbelievable.\"</p><p></p><p>He added: \"We are dumbstruck, that was so surreal. That shark was huge. Like dinosaur huge.\"</p><p></p><p>The words were quickly circulated on Twitter and picked up mainstream media in South Africa and internationally. They were quoted in news reports, magnified in headlines and gained the permanence of print. Coppen saw his hastily written tweet staring back at him from lamppost posters in black and white. He was interviewed by radio stations around the world.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately this left with him with what golfers call the yips, or perhaps the tweeps. He told West Cape News: \"There is almost a sense of pressure – how do you follow up a shark attack tweet? I don't know exactly why people are following me now. The whole thing is pretty farcical.\"</p><p></p><p>And of course even the Cape Town twitterati will not be challenging the Silicon Valley iPad crowd any time soon. As Ferial Haffajee, editor of City Press, noted in a column last year, there are still two South Africas: \"One that tweets on the best technology and one that does not eat.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/4/12/1271067639097/eugene-terreblanche-funer-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/12/david-smith-letter-from-africa-tweets","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/apr/12/david-smith-letter-from-africa-tweets","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Who watches WikiLeaks?","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-09T20:28:16Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/2010/apr/10/wikileaks-collateral-murder-video-iraq","fields":{"body":"<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ_zTrjMhX8\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJ_zTrjMhX8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>It has proclaimed itself the \"intelligence service of the people\", and plans to have more agents than the CIA. They will be you and me.</p><p><a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/\" title=\"\">WikiLeaks</a> is a long way from that goal, but this week it staked its claim to be the dead drop of choice for whistleblowers after releasing video the Pentagon claimed to have lost of US helicopter crews excitedly killing Iraqis on a Baghdad street in 2007. The dead included two Reuters news agency staff. The release of the shocking footage prompted an unusual degree of hand-wringing in a country weary of the Iraq war, and garnered WikiLeaks more than $150,000 in donations to keep its cash-starved operation on the road.</p><p>It also drew fresh attention to a largely anonymous group that has outpaced the competition in just a few short years by releasing to the world more than a million confidential documents from highly classified military secrets to Sarah Palin's hacked emails. WikiLeaks has posted the controversial correspondence between researchers at East Anglia University's Climatic Research Unit and text messages of those killed in the 9/11 attacks.</p><p>WikiLeaks has promised to change the world by abolishing official secrecy. In Britain it is helping to erode the use of the courts to suppress information. Its softly spoken Australian director, Julian Assange, was recently in Iceland, offering advice to legislators on new laws to protect whistleblowers.</p><p>Assange, who describes what he does as a mix of hi-tech investigative journalism and advocacy, foresees a day when any confidential document, from secret orders that allow our own governments to spy on us down to the bossy letters from your children's school, will be posted on WikiLeaks for the whole world to see. And that, Assange believes, will change everything.</p><p>But there are those who fear that WikiLeaks is more like an intelligence service than it would care to admit – a shadowy, unaccountable organisation that tramples on individual privacy and other rights. And like so many others who have claimed to be acting in the name of the people, there are those who fear it risks oppressing them.</p><p>Assange has a shock of white hair and an air of conspiracy about him. He doesn't discuss his age or background, although it is known that he was raised in Melbourne and convicted as a teenager of hacking in to official and corporate websites. He appears to be perpetually on the move but when he stops for any length of time it is in Kenya. Almost nothing is said about anyone else involved with the project.</p><p>WikiLeaks was born in late 2006. Its founders, who WikiLeaks says comprised mostly Chinese dissidents, hackers, computer programmers and journalists, laid out their ambitions in emails inviting an array of figures with experience dealing with secret documents to join WikiLeak's board of advisers. Among those approached was the inspiration for the project, Daniel Ellsberg, the US military analyst who leaked the Pentagon papers about the Vietnam war to the New York Times four&nbsp;decades ago.</p><p>\"We believe that injustice is answered by good governance and for there to be good governance there must be open governance,\" the email said. \"New technology and cryptographic ideas permit us to not only encourage document leaking, but to facilitate it directly on a mass scale. We intend to place a new star in the political firmament of man.\" The email appealed to Ellsberg to be part of the \"political-legal defences\" the organisers recognised they would need once they started to get under the skin of governments, militaries and corporations: \"We'd like … you to form part of our political armour. The more armour we have, particularly in the form of men and women sanctified by age, history and class, the more we can act like brazen young men and get away with it.\"</p><p>Others were approached with a similar message. WikiLeaks organisers suggested that it \"may become the most powerful intelligence agency on earth\". Its primary targets would be \"highly oppressive regimes in China, Russia and central Eurasia, but we also expect to be of assistance to those in the west who wish to reveal illegal or immoral behaviour in their own governments and corporations.\"</p><p>But the group ran in&nbsp; to problems even before WikiLeaks was launched. The organisers approached John Young, who ran another website that posted leaked documents, <a href=\"http://cryptome.org/\" title=\"\">Cryptome</a>, and asked him to register the WikiLeaks website in his name. Young obliged and was initially an enthusiastic supporter but when the organisers announced their intention to try and raise $5m he questioned their motives, saying that kind of money could only come from the CIA or George Soros. Then he walked away.</p><p>\"WikiLeaks is a fraud,\" he wrote in an email when he quit. \"Fuck your cute hustle and disinformation campaign against legitimate dissent. Same old shit, working for the enemy.\" Young then leaked all of his email correspondence with WikiLeak's founders, including the messages to Ellsberg.</p><p>Despite this sticky start, WikiLeaks soon began making a name for itself with a swathe of documents and establishments started kicking back.</p><p>Two years ago, a Swiss bank persuaded a US judge to temporarily shut down the WikiLeaks site after it published documents implicating the Julius Baer bank in money laundering and tax evasion. That revealed WikiLeaks' vulnerability to legal action and it sought to put itself beyond the reach of any government and court by moving its primary server to Sweden which has strong laws to protect whistleblowers. Since then the Australian government has tried to go after WikiLeaks after it posted a secret list of websites the authorities planned to ban, and members of the US Congress demanded to know what legal action could be taken after the site revealed US airport security manuals. Both discovered there was nothing they could do. It's been the same for everyone from the Chinese government to the Scientologists.</p><p>Yet WikiLeaks worries more than just those with an instinctive desire for secrecy. Steven Aftergood, who has published thousands of leaked documents on the <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/blog/secrecy/\" title=\"\">Secrecy News blog</a> he runs for the Federation of American Scientists, turned down an invitation to join WikiLeaks board of advisers.</p><p>\"They have acquired and published documents of extraordinary significance. I would say also that WikiLeaks is a response to a genuine problem, namely the over control of information of public policy significance,\" he says. Yet he also regards WikiLeaks as a threat to individual liberties. \"Their response to indiscriminate secrecy has been to adopt a policy of indiscriminate disclosure. They tend to disregard considerations of personal privacy, intellectual property as well as security,\" he says.</p><p>\"One of the things I find offensive about their operations is their willingness to disclose confidential records of religious and social organisations. If you are a Mormon or a Mason or a college girl who is a member of a sorority with a secret initiation ritual then WikiLeaks is not your friend. They will violate your privacy and your freedom of association without a second thought. That has nothing to do with whistleblowing or accountability. It's simply disclosure for disclosure's sake.\" Aftergood's criticism has angered WikiLeaks. The site's legal advisor, Jay Lim, wrote to Aftergood two years ago warning him to stop. \"Who's side are you on here Stephen? It is time this constant harping stopped,\" Lim said. \"We are very disappointed in your lack of support and suggest you cool it. If you don't, we will, with great reluctance, be forced to respond.\"</p><p>WikiLeaks has also infuriated the author, Michela Wrong, who was horrified to discover her book exposing the depths of official corruption in Kenya, It's Our Turn To Eat, was pirated and posted on WikiLeaks in its entirety on the grounds that Nairobi booksellers were reluctant to sell it for fear of being sued under Kenya's draconian libel laws.</p><p>Wrong was angry because, while she supports what WikiLeaks is about, the book is not a government document and is freely available across the rest of the world. From email distribution lists she could see that the pirated version was being emailed among Kenyans at home and abroad. \"I was beside myself because I thought my entire African market is vanishing,\" says Wrong. \"I wrote to WikiLeaks and said, please, you're going to damage your own cause because if people like me can't make any money from royalties then publishers are not going to commission people writing about corruption in Africa.\" She is not sure who she was communicating with because the WikiLeaks emails carried no identification but she assumes it was Assange because of the depth of knowledge about Kenya in the replies.</p><p>\"He was enormously pompous, saying that in the interests of raising public awareness of the issues involved I had a duty to allow it to be pirated. He said: 'This book may have been your baby, but it is now Kenya's son.' That really stuck in my mind because it was so arrogant,\" she says. \"On the whole I approve of WikiLeaks but these guys are infuriatingly self-righteous.\" WikiLeaks does apparently expect others to respect its claims to ownership. It has placed a copyright symbol at the beginning of its film about the Iraq shootings.</p><p>Assange has countered criticism over some of the material on the site by saying that WikiLeak's central philosophy is \"no censorship\". He argues that the organisation has to be opaque to protect it from legal attack or something more sinister. But that has also meant that awkward questions – such as a revelation in <a href=\"http://motherjones.com/\" title=\"\">Mother Jones</a> that some of those it claims to have recruited, including a former representative of the Dalai Lama, and Noam Chomsky, deny any relationship with WikiLeaks – are sidestepped.</p><p>Despite repeated requests for a response to the issues raised by Aftergood, Wrong and others, WikiLeaks' only response was an email suggesting to call a number that went to a recording saying it was not  in service.</p><p>• This article was amended on 13 April 2010.

Driving a hybrid, like a Prius, not only displays one's wealth as it costs many thousands of dollars more than a conventional but highly fuel-efficient car, but also signals the owner cares about others and the environment.\"</p><p></p><p>In a series of three experiments for the study which is <a href=\"http://www.carlsonschool.umn.edu/assets/140554.pdf\" title=\"\">published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</a>, the researchers found that people were also more likely to choose green products when doing so in public.</p><p></p><p>In one experiment, 168 students were split into two groups. One group read a story about social status while a second group read a story without a status message. Asked to make a hypothetical purchasing decision between a green car or a non-green model of the same price but more luxurious and better-performing, 37.2% in the control group chose the green car. That figure rose to 54.5% for those who read the story designed to \"activate status motives.\" The authors claim the experiment is the first to demonstrate that playing on desire for social status is a way to encourage people to make green choices.</p><p></p><p>In another test, 93 students were asked to pick on a sliding scale between green and non-green products of the same price, depending on whether they were buying in public at a store or in private by shopping online. When the students read a status story similar to the first experiment, their preference in public for the green product was far stronger than in private. A third experiment showed buyers with social status in mind preferred green products when they were more expensive than their conventional alternative.</p><p></p><p>The authors, who also include <a href=\"http://www.csom.umn.edu/Page8713.aspx\" title=\"Vladas Griskevicius of University of Minnesota\">Vladas Griskevicius of University of Minnesota</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unm.edu/~tybur/\" title=\"Joshua M.

Even if people don't care about climate change, they care about what other people think of them.\" He added that one of the most important aspects of the research is that the power of social status could be harnessed to become a critical tool in promoting wider changes in pro-environmental behaviour, such as voting for the greenest party in an election or engaging in environmental activism.</p><p></p><p>The study does come with one important caveat – no one was actually dipping into their wallet. Michael Valvo, a spokesperson for Toyota UK, said that the company's market research indicated the attraction of advanced technology and the cost of the ownership, not the environment or social status, were the main reasons drivers bought the Prius hybrid car. \"Forking out £20,000 for a car is a pretty expensive way to make a statement about being green, it's the second biggest purchase after a house,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>The research also failed to reflect the complexity of ethical consumer activity, said Rob Harrison, the editor of Ethical Consumer magazine. \"Ethical buying behaviour is far more complicated than this.

England resume on 131 for five, a lead of 434, after some clumsy declaration batting yesterday evening. I suppose they will bat on until their lead is 500, which would give them around five-and-a-half sessions to bowl Bangladesh out. Could a Bangladeshi batsman come of age and save the match by replicating Mike Atherton's epic 185 not out at <a href=\"http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63701.html\">Johannesburg in 1995-96</a>? No, obviously not, what a stupid question. But they have four or five very decent batsmen and there is, I would suggest, little chance of this game ending today. Sadly.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>Apparently there's an OBO lexicon. What a terrifying thought</strong> \"I'd like to add a new word to the OBO lexicon, if I may,\" says Neil Stork-Brett. \"The <em>bitch</em>krieg. As in 'I was having a pleasant enough day at work, until I was bitchkrieged by the old hag from accounts'.\"</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>The coolest and most compelling YouTube video ever</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz6aX8ZMdAo&amp;NR=1\">End of and fact</a>.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>Comfort breaks</strong>. That's what they call them these days. It's an interesting phrase, particularly for the humble OBOer, who only gets said breaks once an hour, by which time they are invariably anything but comfortable. Anyway, Alastair Cook took one yesterday and it has, as Lawrence Booth points out in the Daily Mail, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article-1257906/Captain-careful-Cook-fluffs-follow-timid-England-let-slip.html\">caused a wee bit of controversy</a>. (Dismal pun not intended; I use the word 'wee' all the time and can't be bothered to change just to avoid a pun.)</p><p>And there I was thinking John Terry was the only England captain whose tig would get him into trouble this year.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>37th over: England 136-5 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 4, Prior 1)</strong> The left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak will open the bowling to Matthew James Prior, who drives a single square on the off side. Bell then cuts a short ball to third man for four to get off the mark. This is fun. \"Do you do shout-outs?\" asks Mac Millings, knowing full well we don't but ploughing on regardless. \"My in-laws have been staying in our spare room, and will be leaving tomorrow. Please make the wording for the shout-out as follows: '<em>Eff off, and don't come back</em>'.\"</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>38th over: England 142-5 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 5, Prior 6)</strong> Shakib Al Hasan will start at the Pavilion End, having taken two for 33 yesterday evening, and Prior makes room to drive an emphatic boundary, inside out over extra-cover. Good shot. \"I've just seen Pavement twice over the weekend in Melbourne,\" says Ian Forth. \"They were outstanding, though Bob Nastanovich still gets away with not having a role 20 years on. Anyhow I was reminded of their lyrics  - <em>I got beat by weather, Carrot rope, feed my thrill, It's time to get me off the ground, The wicket keeper is down</em>. Am struggling to recall any other indie mentions of cricket. It's ironic (I suppose) that a Californian group provides the only example I can think of. Any others? (And no, I don't think Fiery Jack is an homage to Hobbs or Bannister).\" Funnily enough we <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/mar/11/bangladesh-england-first-test-cricket-live\">discussed this on the first day</a>. I say 'discussed'; it was mentioned in the 49th over and then petered out apologetically, like most things in life.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>39th over: England 144-5 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 6, Prior 7)</strong> Razzak beats Prior with a lovely delivery that pitched on middle and turned sharply away to hit the back pad. It was missing off by a fair way, but it was beautifully bowled. \"Another addition for the OBO lexicon: Snakehips,\" says Neil Stork-Brett. \"Used colloquially to describe incidents where you find yourself naked for no apparent reason and sharing a bed with an OBO groupie.\" There are OBO groupies?</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 144-6 (Prior c Shahadat b Shakib 7)</strong> Prior takes one for the team, holing out to mid-on as he tries to lift Shakib down the ground.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>40th over: England 146-6 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 8, Swann 0)</strong> Steve Harmison made the very good point yesterday that, having not enforced the follow on so as to give their bowlers a rest, there is little point having Bresnan, Broad and the rest out in the middle getting themselves sweaty. England led by nearly 450 and could surely declare, but here's Graeme Swann, promoted up the order to biff some quick runs.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>41st over: England 158-6 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 17, Swann 3)</strong> Swann steers Razzak for three to get off the mark first ball. Bell then clouts consecutive boundaries, a sweep and a pull. This is completely pointless cricket. Not even a mother could love this passage of play.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>42nd over: England 162-6 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 19, Swann 5)</strong> \"This is not the same email address as the one shown before play started,\" says Rai Skrupskis. \"What's up with that? Are there Smyth doppelgangers in cyberspace?\" There is, mercifully, only one Rob Smyth.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>43rd over: England 169-6 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 20, Swann 11)</strong> Swann rocks back to pull Razzak vigorously for four and then loops a leading edge just back over the bowler's head. \"I misread the third sentence of your 41st-over entry, by not seeing the last two words, 'of play',\" says Mac Millings. \"The way I read it struck me, because that's exactly what my proctologist told me last week. He was wrong, though. She loves everything about me, and is creepily inappropriate.\"</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>44th over: England 172-6 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 21, Swann 13)</strong> Bell's average against Bangladesh <a href=\"http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/9062.html?class=1;opposition=25;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">moves stealthily towards ten million</a>.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>45th over: England 179-6 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 26, Swann 15)</strong> Bell plays a classy late cut for four off Razzak, the beauty of which came poignantly close to justifying this passage of play.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>46th over: England 187-6 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 27, Swann 22)</strong> Swann sweeps Shakib's first ball handsomely over square leg for four. He has 22 from 17 balls and is one of the few English batsmen who excels when it comes to batting for a declaration in the third innings. In fact I'd say he's the only one who can score at a strike-rate of 100 from the start without significantly compromising his natural game, Pietersen included, despite yesterday's effort.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>47th over: England 200-6 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 36, Swann 26)</strong> Bell dances down the track and drives Razzak beautifully over long-on for six. Swann switch-hits a full toss for four and then, absurdly, the game stalls while the England batsmen have a change of gloves, or a rub down with a towel, or an epiphany. England now lead by 503, but they are going to bat on, for kicks.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>48th over: England 205-6 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 37, Swann 30)</strong> Here's Ian Forth. \"Is this a damned-if-he-does, damned-if-he-doesn't innings for Bell? (They nearly all are.) Or is this a shot to nothing innings? Or a win/win innings? Or a pyrrhic victory innings? Is it possible for Bell to just go out and play an innings any more, without an epithet attached? Perhaps this is his neither fish nor fowl innings.\" It's an IRB innings.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>49th over: England 208-6 (led by 303 on first innings; Bell 38, Swann 32)</strong> The quick bowler Rubel Hossain comes on. Nothing of interest happens. Sorry. This really is pointless.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 209-7 declared (Swann c Siddique b Shakib 32)</strong> Swann switch-hits Shakib straight to cover (for the right-hander, duh), and England finally call it a day. Swann played well, and selflessly, for 32 from 25 balls, and England passed 200 despite nobody reaching 40. Curious. Shakib ends with four for 62, and <strong>Bangladesh will need 513 to win</strong>. Bye, slim! Bye!</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>1st over: Bangladesh 0-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 0, Imrul Kayes 0)</strong> Broad goes straight around the wicket to Tamim Iqbal, who misses with both a full-blooded cut and a booming drive. Excellent start from Broad. \"Is Bumble back on the commentary team?\" asks Chris O'Connor. \"Yesterday Mark Butcher described him as 'looking like Gollum' as he was suffering from a nasty dose of something exotic. Nice description I thought!\" He isn't. Not yet anyway.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>2nd over: Bangladesh 4-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 0, Imrul Kayes 4)</strong> Bresnan's first ball is a lamentable wide half-volley, and Imrul Kayes leans in to drive it through the covers for four. Kayes was roughed up by Broad in the first innings so Bresnan, predictably, starts digging the ball in after that, but Kayes is reasonably comfortable. I wonder if England were close to opening with Finn and Broad. This isn't the most tactically adventurous regime, for all their obvious qualities in other areas. Flower, Strauss and Cook seem like the types who might leave their socks on while doing their special exercise.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>3rd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 1, Imrul Kayes 8)</strong> Broad gets his first pop at Imrul Kayes, with a leg gully and short leg. He has a huge shout for LBW second ball when Kayes ducks into a delivery that doesn't get up as much as he expected. Shades of <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-163174822339797901#\">Glenn McGrath's dismissal of Sachin Tendulkar</a> all those years ago. It hit Kayes on the back as he turned away and would have rammed into leg and middle, but it pitched a fair way outside leg stump. Kayes is rattled and has airy flick at the next ball, which flies off the glove and just wide of Prior, diving to his right down the leg side.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>4th over: Bangladesh 16-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 8, Imrul Kayes 8)</strong> Tamim flashes a short one from Bresnan behind point for four. He looks in good nick again. \"'The Parable of Glenn McGrath's Haircut' by TISM,\" offers Paul Hayes. \"They also do a song called \"X-treme Sports Can Kiss My Arse\". Some OBOers might like it. Oh... And when I saw Pavement, Bob Nastanovich gave us strips of silver foil when we handed in out tickets. I have no idea why.\"</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>5th over: Bangladesh 16-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 8, Imrul Kayes 8)</strong> A maiden from Broad to Tamim.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>6th over: Bangladesh 19-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 10, Imrul Kayes 9)</strong> England thought they had Imrul Kayes caught at leg gully off Bresnan, but Tony Hill was having none of it and replays suggested it came only off the pad or hip. I do think England are missing a trick by not bowling Finn here.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>7th over: Bangladesh 22-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 11, Imrul Kayes 10)</strong> Kayes is beaten as he chases Broad's shock delivery, namely the good-length ball. It's all a bit low-key at the moment.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>8th over: Bangladesh 26-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 11, Imrul Kayes 14)</strong> Kayes recoils from a very good lifter from Bresnan, but not before it had popped off the edge. It went on the bounce to second slip. The next ball is much shorter and Kayes whirls his wrists to send it over leg gully for four. Decent shot, although he still looks far from comfortable against the short ball. \"How fast does Broad actually bowl?\" asks J David Moore. \" I seem to recall some radar figures in one home series or other (can't get more specific than that at this time of night) that everyone at the time seemed to treat as slightly less reliable than the average campaign promise.  Is there a consensus judgment regarding his real pace level?\" Isn't he around 85-88mph, occasionally moving above 90? I know they have advanced a lot in 14 years, but I've never really trusted the speedgun since the Lord's Test of 1996, when Mark Ealham was apparently quicker than Wasim Akram.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>9th over: Bangladesh 27-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 12, Imrul Kayes 14)</strong> Steven Finn replaces Stuart Broad (4-2-7-0) and soon has Kayes ducking awkwardly under a very well-directed short ball, so much so that he lost his balance and staggered back towards square leg after the ball had passed the bat.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>10th over: Bangladesh 29-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 13, Imrul Kayes 15)</strong> Swann replaces Bresnan (4-0-18-0). He will bowl a lot of overs today, almost half probably. Matt Prior opens his face and a few words fall out: \"T<em>wo left-handers here, just for you Swanny!\"</em> Tamim sweeps fine for a single and then Kayes misses an attempted cut stroke.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>11th over: Bangladesh 33-0 (chasing 513; Tamim Iqbal 14, Imrul Kayes 18)</strong> Finn has a pretty big shout for LBW against Tamim turned down from a shortish off-cutter that didn't quite get up. It pitched outside leg, although it would have hit the top of off and middle. Finn is bowling nicely and Tamim involuntarily takes one hand off the bat as he attempts to cut a delivery that jags back to cramp him for room.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>WICKET! Bangladesh 33-1 (Tamim Iqbal b Swann 14)</strong> The dangerman Tamim falls to a beautiful piece of spin bowling. Swann, bowling around the wicket, drew him forward with a ball that dipped onto middle and then turned past the outside edge to hit the top of off. Textbook stuff, and Swann is four wickets away from his first Test ten-for. Jeez he's good.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>12th over: Bangladesh 34-1 (chasing 513; Imrul Kayes 18, Junaid Siddique 1)</strong> Siddique drives through extra-cover to get off the mark.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>13th over: Bangladesh 40-1 (chasing 513; Imrul Kayes 18, Junaid Siddique 7)</strong> Siddique, groping tentatively with no feet movement, inside-edges Finn just wide of leg stump and away for four.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>14th over: Bangladesh 41-1 (chasing 513; Imrul Kayes 19, Junaid Siddique 7)</strong> When Kayes pushes back down the ground, Swann tries a sly right-handed flick to run out the non-striker Siddique, who would have been out had it hit the stumps. Excellent, imaginative stuff.  \"Yes, I'm out here,\" says Ross Moulden. \"Don't really have much to say, but I'm reading along. How would you rate the debutants' performances?\" I didn't see Carberry's innings yesterday but his performance against the spinners first time around was a bit of a worry. Finn has been pretty good; you can see why people are so excited about him.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>WICKET! Bangladesh 45-2 (Imrul Kayes c Prior b Finn 23)</strong> Steven Finn strikes with the last ball before lunch. It was a beauty, a lifter across the left-handed Kayes that moved away to take the thinnest of edges on its way through to Matt Prior. That really was a snorter. See you in 30 minutes.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>15th over: Bangladesh 47-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 7, Aftab Ahmed 2)</strong> Finn has three balls remaining of the over he began before lunch. How long ago that seems. Those were different days. Afab Ahmed pushes his first ball into the covers for a couple. \"Another addition to the OBO lexicon: the JCL,\" says Neil Stork-Brett. \"'JCL' is the common descriptive of the rarely spotted OBO lurker with the distinctive call of 'Come on England!'. They appear in great flocks every four years or so if the conditions are right i.e. England are winning, they can see it on the telly for free. Live in large roosts called 'pubs'.\"</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>16th over: Bangladesh 49-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 9, Aftab Ahmed 2)</strong> Siddique works a quicker one from Swann off the pads for a couple. Is anyone out there? It's Monday morning! Come on, it's definitely light out now; I can see it through the slits.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>17th over: Bangladesh 49-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 9, Aftab Ahmed 2)</strong> A good, challenging maiden from Finn to Aftab. \"I haven't had the chance to see Steve Finn in action,\" says Jonathan Williams. \"Any resemblance at all to the Harmless-One, or has he been selected purely for the fact a) he's tall, b) he's called Steve?\" It's been a quietly promising debut. I'm tempted to say there's only so far wrong you can go with such raw materials, but the later years of Harmison would suggest otherwise. There's something there, though. He reminds me a bit of Jason Gillespie in his gait and the trajectory of his deliveries, even if his action is more like Glenn McGrath's. I'm excited. Aren't you excited?</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>18th over: Bangladesh 49-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 9, Aftab Ahmed 2)</strong> Swann has a slip, gully and short leg for Siddique, who is content to defend, a little crabbily at times. It's a maiden.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>19th over: Bangladesh 54-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 9, Aftab Ahmed 6)</strong> Aftab, driving away from his body, snicks Finn low through the slips for four.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>20th over: Bangladesh 59-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 13, Aftab Ahmed 7)</strong> Siddique is almost strokeless at the moment. \"He's digging a hole here Swanny boy!\" says Matt Prior. Inevitably, Siddique clouts the next delivery, a full toss, through midwicket for four. \"How about 'grifting',\" says Eamonn Maloney, \"the practice of grafting a riff single-handedly, conning others into participating in order to decry it?\"</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>21st over: Bangladesh 65-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 14, Aftab Ahmed 12)</strong> Aftab Ahmed pulls Finn extravagantly, high in the air and away for four behind square. \"Until four days ago I was suffering from the worst bout of insomnia for at least two years, waking at 4.15 every morning and unable to get back to sleep as I reflected on the cuts to the Higher Education sector,\" says Simon Ward. \"I have found the cure!! Let's hope Bangladesh can keep going till tomorrow's morning session.\" While I have enormous concern for your welfare, obviously, the prospect of sitting at home tonight until the wee hours with the new Coen Brothers DVD and a few gallons of Pinot Grigio, then sleeping like a baby, is so seductive that I shall have to overrule your comment. Anyway, isn't there an easy cure for insomnia: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVTNyXtW8rE\">putting your head in Meatloaf's cleavage</a>.</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>22nd over: Bangladesh 65-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 14, Aftab Ahmed 12)</strong> A maiden from Swann, who is rattling through his overs. Come on England, just eight more. \"Plus,\" says Simon Ward, \"your book isn't available till May.\" It'll be prescription-only by June.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>23rd over: Bangladesh 65-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 14, Aftab Ahmed 12)</strong> Broad replaces Finn. If Siddique wants a drive he'd better buy a car, and other tired sledges. For now he's bowling to Aftab Ahmed, and there is a little sniff of reverse-swing from the first ball. Broad, as Mark Butcher points out on Sky, might fancy getting Aftab LBW playing around his front pad, so everything in that over is either full or a good length – until the final delivery, which is short and forces Aftab to sway out of the way. A maiden. \"At the lunch break I went to check out Diggnation,\" says Jeremy Bunting, losing me at 'Diggnation'. \"They are up to Show 245 (I think). Two guys – Rose and Kevin – yacking about technology and other hot latest news for an hour whilst drinking a lot of beer. To my amazement this Test series was not in the top-five news stories.\"</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>24th over: Bangladesh 69-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 18, Aftab Ahmed 12)</strong> Swann tries to tempt Siddique with a bit of flight, so Siddique just spanks him straight down the ground for four. Good stroke. \"Rob,\" says Niall Taylor. \"Might I propose 'to cry the lonely fool' for your lexicon? This describes the practice of an OBO commentator lamenting 'Anyone out there?' and then not publishing any (either?) of the emails then received. Presumably they get stored in a special folder for comfort in future lonely periods.\" I laminate them.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>25th over: Bangladesh 69-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 18, Aftab Ahmed 12)</strong> Broad goes for a little play in Geoff Boycott's favourite corridor, but Aftab is comfortable in defence. Broad's pace is down to the low-80s. This is a tedious little spell, with the game going nowhere. \"I think you need a fascinating fact to keep you awake,\" says Martin Wright. \"So... did you know that Embu Prison in Kenya spends £100 a day on firewood for cooking? If that doesn't get you excited about biogas, what will? Eh?\" All very well, but where's this fascinating fact you promised, etc, etc.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>26th over: Bangladesh 70-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 19, Aftab Ahmed 12)</strong> Bresnan is going off for a comfort break, which isn't really allowed. Swann's quicker ball comes within a whisker of hurrying through Siddique, who gets the latest of inside-edges to fine leg. \"Finn's really the most facially expressive of the English bowlers, especially if he's bowled a bad one – an open show of disgust at himself and a lurky leer at the batsman,\" says Khademul Islam. \"He really has thin long teeth. Broad looks thoughtful when he's smacked. Bresnan is hearty, smack or wicket, he's expressionless.\" These descriptions are lovely, and so long as they don't trigger a train of thought that takes us straight to Tim Bresnan's sexx face via  a new high-speed service, everything will be fine. Oh.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>27th over: Bangladesh 74-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 22, Aftab Ahmed 13)</strong> \"I wonder how Harmison found it commentating on the young lad who may be taking his place,\" says Tom van der Gucht. \"It reminds me of when Ashley Giles was in the commentary box whilst injured and Panesar made his debut. Bumble was going mad, explaining how exciting it was to finally have a 'world-class spinner' whilst Giles just had to grin and bear it with the air of a man who has just been made redundant sitting in a nightclub whilst watching his girlfriend dancing and laughing  with a charming and well-groomed millionaire. He couldn't really say 'yeah well, he can't bat or field as well as me can he?' without coming across as an embittered tosspot.\" There was a nice moment in Perth in 2006-07, when Panesar replaced Giles and took a wicket in his first or second over. The camera cut to Giles on the balcony, and there was a real warmth and sincerity to his smile. It seemed that way from afar, anyway.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>28th over: Bangladesh 83-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 23, Aftab Ahmed 19)</strong> Swann spears a delivery down the leg side and Prior commits all manner of errors. He fails to stop it, which costs two byes; then he refers to himself in the third person, shouting \"Oh Matty!\"; then he kicks fresh air; and then he shouts \"Eff you!\". I don't know where to start with that. He's basically told himself to eff off, but in the third person, which is quite an achievement. Later in the over, Aftab drives sweetly through the covers for four.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>29th over: Bangladesh 89-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 23, Aftab Ahmed 25)</strong> Aftab drives Broad for a couple and then lifts a full delivery splendidly over square leg over four. England look a bit flat, but it's extremely hard work on a pitch that hasn't deteriorated at all. Too many Test pitches just die these days.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>30th over: Bangladesh 90-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 24, Aftab Ahmed 25)</strong> Some more dodgy running from Bangladesh, but Siddique eventually sneaks home. Carberry's throw from cover missed anyway. \"An OBO lexicon eh?\" says Gary Naylor. \"In a previous life, OBO regulars, Lee Calvert, Clare Davies and I produced this <a href=\"http://www.thegoogly.com/cricket_lexicon/\">cricket lexicon</a> - sample: To Bowden (v.t) – <em>To transform a role previously entirely procedural into an attraction in itself by dint of the ego of the incumbent all the while getting on everyone's nerves.</em> Usage - 'Ulrika Jonsson did the weather forecast for TV-am, but bowdened the job into a key element of the show'.\"</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>31st over: Bangladesh 98-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 32, Aftab Ahmed 25)</strong> Bresnan comes back into the attack and Siddique, going for a big drive, inside-edges his first ball for four. Another boundary comes in more authentic fashion later in the over, when he gets up on the balls of his feet and cuts confidently for four to bring up the fifty partnership. Bowling on the subcontinent? Nobody said it was easy. \"Did Prior really say 'Eff You'?\" asks Martin Wright. \"In which case he's insulted himself in the third person euphemistically - surely a first for any England keeper? Or are we still before the watershed?\" After these weird early starts I'm no longer sure what day it is, never mind what time.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>32nd over: Bangladesh 99-2 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 32, Aftab Ahmed 26)</strong> Aftab sweeps Swann in the air but safe, well short of Pietersen at deep backward square. \"This has been a very one-sided Test, but would you agree that the Banglas are showing they've got the tools to become far better than they are?\" asks Ranil Dissanayake. \"I think they're not short of having three or four really top class players. Give Shakib, Mahmadullah, Tamim and Mushfiqur two or three years to really develop and they'll be really good players. The quick bowling is an issue, as is their tendency to fail in bunches, but I think a lucky win or two will start them on a very upward trajectory.\" It'll be a slow trajectory, but I agree that their batting is not in bad order, certainly on wickets such as these. I think Aftab can bat as well. And this is the only way for them to learn. Of all the sides to come into Test cricket since England and Australia started off in 1877, only Pakistan were not whipping boys for the first decade or two.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>WICKET! Bangladesh 99-3 (Aftab Ahmed c Prior b Bresnan 26)</strong> England really needed that, and it's a nice piece of bowling. Bresnan gets a hint of reverse inswing and Aftab, on the drive, gets a thin edge through to Prior.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>33rd over: Bangladesh 99-3 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 32, Mahmudullah 0)</strong> A very similar delivery beats Mahmudullah first ball. A wicket maiden for Bresnan. \"I know you know that Digg is a news gathering site and appears on the Guardian website regularly as in 'Digg this story',\" says Jeremy Bunting, erroneously assuming that I live in the 21st century. \"Diggnation is <a href=\"http://revision3.com/diggnation/dolphinboat\">a weekly webcast</a> where the Digg founder, Kevin Rose, and his buddy get drunk and comment on the most popular Digged stories. It's rather entertaining.\" I really don't understand why more people don't do drunk/sweary podcasts. We're all grown-ups here. (Technically.) And people are, sadly, almost always more interesting, funny and entertaining when they are drunk, drinking, or both.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>34th over: Bangladesh 99-3 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 32, Mahmudullah 0)</strong> Swann's into a long spell now. That maiden, to Siddique, was his 13th over.</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>35th over: Bangladesh 103-3 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 32, Mahmudullah 4)</strong> Bresnan turns Mahmudullah round, but he softens the hands to edge it low through the slips for four.</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>36th over: Bangladesh 103-3 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 32, Mahmudullah 4)</strong> Siddique looks in control against Swann, and that's another maiden. Of the 77 balls Siddique has faced, 55 have been bowled by Swann. Yes, I have been reduced to typing such dull stats in lieu of anything interesting happening on the field or in my inbox.</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>WICKET! Bangladesh 105-4 (Mahmudullah b Bresnan 5)</strong> This is very good from Bresnan. He has been excellent with the old ball in this game – better than with the new ball, strangely – and he has just reverse-swung a length delivery right through Mahmudullah and into middle and leg stump. It wasn't a great shot from Mahmadullah, who left a discernible gate as he whipped across the line, but it was good bowling from Bresnan, who has been reversing it both ways in this spell.</p><!-- Block 62 --><p><strong>37th over: Bangladesh 105-4 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 33, Shakib Al Hasan 0)</strong> Bowling with the old ball is a vital quality in Australia – which, to judge from commentators and journalists everywhere, is the only place England will play Test cricket in the next 12 years – and in that regard Bresnan has done himself no harm in this game.</p><!-- Block 63 --><p><strong>WICKET! Bangladesh 110-5 (Shakib LBW b Swann 4)</strong> Shakib is given out LBW off the glove. He tried to sweep Swann, missed and was plumb in front, but after a few replays the penny dropped that the ball had not hit the pad at all. Shakib is understandably frustrated as he walks off but, in defence of the umpire Tony Hill, the decision looked entirely straightforward at full speed.</p><!-- Block 64 --><p><strong>38th over: Bangladesh 110-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 34, Mushfiqur Rahim 0)</strong> That was the final ball of the over. There are still 20 minutes to go until tea.</p><!-- Block 65 --><p><strong>39th over: Bangladesh 115-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 35, Mushfiqur Rahim 4)</strong> Mushfiqur inside-edges Bresnan past Prior for four.</p><!-- Block 66 --><p><strong>40th over: Bangladesh 120-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 37, Mushfiqur Rahim 7)</strong> \"I know it would be a flagrant lie to claim that I hate to be picky, so can we just imagine an apologetic air to this email?\" says Josh Robinson. \"I think it's not so much bowling with the old ball that's important in Australia as bowling well with it, or even dangerously. And ultimately there's a difference in terms of what's required between bowling well with it when Bangladesh are three down and over 400 behind, and bowling with Australia 240 for two after 55 overs.\" Well of course there is, reversing it is a pretty decent start whatever the context. I don't particularly think Bresnan will make it at Test level, even though I do think he's underrated, but it's surely unnecessarily churlish to belittle how well he has bowled with the old ball in this match.</p><!-- Block 67 --><p><strong>41st over: Bangladesh 121-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 38, Mushfiqur Rahim 8)</strong> Siddique misses an ambitious cut stroke at a delivery from Bresnan that was probably a touch too close for the shot. Just two overs until tea now.</p><!-- Block 68 --><p><strong>42nd over: Bangladesh 123-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 38, Mushfiqur Rahim 9)</strong> Mushfiqur charges Swann and then drags him towards deep midwicket for a single.</p><!-- Block 69 --><p><strong>43rd over: Bangladesh 124-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 38, Mushfiqur Rahim 10)</strong> Alastair Cook wants to get an extra over in before tea, so brings on Kevin Pietersen for Tim Bresnan. His fifth doesn't bounce at all and misses Siddique's off stump by <em>this</em> much.</p><!-- Block 70 --><p><strong>44th over: Bangladesh 125-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 38, Mushfiqur Rahim 11)</strong> That's tea. England need five wickets in the final session for a day off. See you in 10 minutes.</p><!-- Block 71 --><p><strong>TEA</strong></p><!-- Block 72 --><p><strong>45th over: Bangladesh 130-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 42, Mushfiqur Rahim 12)</strong> Kevin Pietersen continues, having bowled one over before tea. Matt Prior sneezes. It's just about the most eloquent to come out of his face all day, and other cheap jokes. Pietersen is getting turn and bounce – he usually does – and Mushfiqur pushes one down awkwardly and short of Cook at short leg. A decent over is tarnished by a long hop that Siddique cuts for four. \"37th over stellar collision,\" says John Starbuck, losing me at '37th over'. \"Recent news: according to Vadim Bobylev (using Hipparcos data and other astronomical measurements), there's an 86% chance of the star Gliese 710 smashing into our solar system, in about 1.5 million years. This would be time enough for England to win in Australia at least once.\"</p><!-- Block 73 --><p><strong>46th over: Bangladesh 134-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 43, Mushfiqur Rahim 15)</strong> Mushfiqur sweeps Swann a fraction short of Carberry, running in and diving forward from deepish midwicket. \"If we fast forward to the first Ashes test, what are the chances that England could be in this position with Australia on the ropes?\" says Geoff Roberts. \"About 0000.1%?  Let's keep it in perspective shall we?\" Keep what in perspective? What have I done now?</p><!-- Block 74 --><p><strong>47th over: Bangladesh 134-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 43, Mushfiqur Rahim 15)</strong> A maiden from Pietersen. \"According to the almost award-winning Jarrod Kimber in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1905411774/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_i3?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=1T4XXV8NCEQJKSMAPPXX&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=467198433&amp;pf_rd_i=468294\">When Freddie Became Jesus</a>, the Aussies can't handle swing, and reverse swing is kryptonite to them,\" says Andy Bradshaw. \"Therefore having a bowler who can bat and can reverse swing the Kookaburra ball is essential.\"</p><!-- Block 75 --><p><strong>48th over: Bangladesh 134-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 43, Mushfiqur Rahim 15)</strong> A fine over from Swann to Mushfiqur, including a slider that zipped past an attempted cut stroke and only missed off stump. \"I love that bawlin' Swanny, I love that bawlin',\" says Paul Collingwood, before adding \"I love that bawlin'\" for the benefit of very stupid people. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/pcollingwood5\">Collingwood is now on Twitter</a>, you know, which is the biggest ginger-related disappointment I can recall since the death of Clive Gibbons in Neighbours.</p><!-- Block 76 --><p><strong>49th over: Bangladesh 138-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 47, Mushfiqur Rahim 15)</strong> Finn comes on to replace Pietersen. There is a pretty big shout for LBW against Siddique, which was going down leg, and Siddique then slaps a boundary through the covers.</p><!-- Block 77 --><p><strong>50th over: Bangladesh 140-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 48, Mushfiqur Rahim 16)</strong> Prior has been cussing plenty on the stump mic – Bob Willis apologised earlier – and he's at it again when Siddique drives Swann loosely into the covers. \"Perspective,\" shouts Guy Hornsby, providing a variation on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TY92AzZRZ0&amp;feature=related#t=4m22s\">the scene in Se7en</a> where Kevin Spacey first walks into the police station. \"On a Monday morning. When you've been following this wondrous feast of cricket since 3am? I think that'd be a lot to ask for even the most die-hard OBOers. Let's take this series for what it is though: one we need to win, and one where we'll have a chance to blood some squad players, maybe unearth some new talent, and get the experience of a subcontinental tour under the belt. So far, this has done Bresnan no harm, Broad's had the responsibility of leading an attack, Finn's got an unexpected and handy debut, and Swann's got the chance of a ten-for. It's not all doom and gloom (well, unless you're Smyth, and he gets all our sympathy).\"</p><!-- Block 78 --><p><strong>51st over: Bangladesh 140-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 48, Mushfiqur Rahim 16)</strong> Just when you think England are in, they pull themselves back out. This partnership is proving pretty irksome, although Finn nearly slips a very fine yorker through Siddique. A maiden. \"Why can't the English learn how to worry about winning in the right continent?\" says Paul Frame. \"I know the Ashes are the most important series for an English cricket  fan, but it must be pointed out that England haven't won a Test series in India since 1984-85. I think that Swann is going to be a huge factor in how England play in Australia. When was the last time England went to Australia with one of the best spin bowlers in the world?\" 2006-07, and they didn't pick him. Also, I don't understand the reference to India, but then I am quite stupid.</p><!-- Block 79 --><p><strong>52nd over: Bangladesh 141-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 48, Mushfiqur Rahim 17)</strong> You have to downgrade established cliches for Bangladesh's relatively modest Test contributions, and the nervous nineties have become the flighty forties for Siddique, who is struggling against Swann. One very iffy drive flew through the vacant gully area in that over. \"I am new to IPL,\" says Martin Brown. \"Who do I choose to support, and why please?\" None of them. It's meaningless filth. Hope this helps.</p><!-- Block 80 --><p><strong>53rd over: Bangladesh 141-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 48, Mushfiqur Rahim 17)</strong> There is a bit of reverse swing for Finn, who sets Mushfiqur up with a load of inswingers and then beats him with a slightly wider outswinger. A good maiden. \"Notwithstanding reverse swing, lack of real pace etc, England's cricket team (pleasingly, changes in personnel don't seem to make much difference) have developed the ability to turn small advantages into victories and large disadvantages into draws,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Of course, they still lose from time to time, but they don't fold under pressure that often and can be ruthless when required. They also look like a team, rather than a set of blokes being forced to get on with each other by an overly enthusiastic PE teacher. This augurs well for an Ashes series that I expect to turn on key moments, rather than on a gulf in class and experience as was the case last time Down Under.\" Mostly true, but we were saying exactly the same thing at the same stage four years ago. One thing I would say is that they really do seem to enjoy each other's company. That has come across loud and clear – very loud – in this match.</p><!-- Block 81 --><p><strong>54th over: Bangladesh 145-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 52, Mushfiqur Rahim 17)</strong> Siddique finally gets to his fifty, driving Swann handsomely over mid-off. It's been a scratchy but determined effort, his sixth half-century in Tests. \"There seems to be conspiracy between the two teams to make you work tomorrow,\" says Phil Withall. \"On a different note the most mentioned news item in Australia over the last week was Michael Clarke and Lara Bingle splitting up.  It rated twice the number of mentions as the biggest floods in 100 years hitting Queensland Good thing nothing  like that would happen in Blighty!\" Yep. We're all about perspective over here.</p><!-- Block 82 --><p><strong>55th over: Bangladesh 145-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 52, Mushfiqur Rahim 17)</strong> Mushfiqur blocks another good inswinging yorker from Finn. That's about it. There are 80 minutes' play remaining, and unelss England take at least two wickets in that time they won't be claiming the extra half-hour. Gah! That's right: GAH! \"Panesar world class in 2006-07, really?\" says Paul Frame. \"He was the best English spinner but Swann's performances in South Africa have shown he's probably the most potent English spinner for over 20 years, don't you think?\" Well, when Duncan Fletcher said, in the summer of 2006, that <a href=\"http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2006/aug/10monty.htm\">Panesar was the best finger-spinner in the world</a>, nobody queried it. Swann is great but let's not get completely carried away: against <a href=\"http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/20431.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=2;opposition=3;opposition=6;orderby=default;template=results;type=bowling\">good teams he averages in the mid-30s</a>.</p><!-- Block 83 --><p><strong>56th over: Bangladesh 147-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 54, Mushfiqur Rahim 17)</strong> Siddique flicks a flighted delivery from Swann for a couple. \"Get one and we'll get two here boys,\" says Matt Prior, before instantly upgrading his ambitions, just because he can. \"Get six and we'll get seven and eight. Come on!\"</p><!-- Block 84 --><p><strong>57th over: Bangladesh 148-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 54, Mushfiqur Rahim 18)</strong> Finn (11-4-31-1) is replaced by Bresnan, who nearly beats Mushfiqur with a low-bouncing reverse outswinger first ball. I'd considering sacrificing a Murder, She Wrote boxset for five quick wickets here. \"Reading about Colly's admiration of Swanny's bawling, what's the feeblest piece of bowler-encouragement the OBOers have heard?\" asks Steve Hudson. \"In club games, my preference would be the yell of 'GOOD PACE, FELLER!!' that accompanies anything that bounces just once on its way to the keeper.\" Hearing \"it's the arm ball!\" as yet another one didn't spin was always really, really good for the ego.</p><!-- Block 85 --><p><strong>58th over: Bangladesh 154-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 55, Mushfiqur Rahim 23)</strong> Mushfiqur emerges from his bunker to slog-sweep Swann mightily for four. \"Good point about Swann averaging in the mid-30s against India, South Africa and Australia,\" says Paul Frame. \"However, in the search for perspective, Panesar's stats against those same <a href=\"http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/18655.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=2;opposition=3;opposition=6;orderby=default;template=results;type=allround\">three teams reveal an average of nearly 45</a>.\" True, but I'm only talking about 2006-07, when he'd just had a great series against Pakistan. We're always playing a bit fast and loose when we select stats against certain teams, and that's the kind of statsguru maverick I am, but I still reckon it's generally fair to split averages into those against the top six and against the rest. (Australia, India and SA are the only three of the top six that Swann has played against.)</p><!-- Block 86 --><p><strong>59th over: Bangladesh 154-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 55, Mushfiqur Rahim 23)</strong> More unrewarded toil from Bresnan, a maiden to Siddique, who looks more and more like a left-handed take on Trevor Franklin, with added forward defensives. \"I've got some news that'll brighten your day Rob,\" says Pete Hackleton. \"Clive Gibbons (over 48) isn't actually dead – <a href=\"http://www.perfectblend.net/neighbourhood/bio/gibbons-clive.htm\">he just doesn't live in Erinsbrough any more</a>.  He moved to the outback (or realistically, probably Anson's Corner).\"</p><!-- Block 87 --><p><strong>60th over: Bangladesh 154-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 55, Mushfiqur Rahim 23)</strong> Swann's mammoth spell of 25-5-56-2 comes to an end, and here comes Stuart Broad. He has lacked the snap he had in the first innings, although he does beat Mushfiqur with a decent delivery that left hiim off the seam. Then he thuds a big inswinger into the pad; only an inside-edge saved Mushfiqur. \"My favourite is to say 'genuine edge, that one!' after an imperious drive or withering cut or pull,\" says Andrew Benzeval. \"Occasionally even the batsman has a chuckle.\" Yep, and that chuckle is definitely <em>with</em> you. Definitely.</p><!-- Block 88 --><p><strong>61st over: Bangladesh 154-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 55, Mushfiqur Rahim 23)</strong> Ah, Swann has switched ends, but he could be bowling from up on high and Siddique would do the same thing: thrust forward defensively. He has played Swann very well for the most part, and it's another maiden.</p><!-- Block 89 --><p><strong>62nd over: Bangladesh 162-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 55, Mushfiqur Rahim 31)</strong> Mushfiqur square-drives Broad for four, and then jabs down desperately on an off-cutter that was homing in on his back pad. To finish an eventful over, Mushfiqur drives thrillingly through extra-cover for four to bring up the fifty partnership. Someone send me an email. Please. Just one email. It's all I ask.</p><!-- Block 90 --><p><strong>63rd over: Bangladesh 164-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 57, Mushfiqur Rahim 31)</strong> Siddique breaks the habit of the last half hour by cutting Swann for a couple. He has 57 from 168 balls, an endearingly retro rate of scoring. \"<a href=\"http://www.google.com/dictionary?langpair=en|en&amp;q=desperation&amp;hl=en&amp;aq=f\">OBO</a>\" says Daniel Herman. No arguments here.</p><!-- Block 91 --><p><strong>64th over: Bangladesh 169-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 61, Mushfiqur Rahim 32)</strong> Siddique whips Broad uppishly but between the men at short midwicket and mid-on. \"An email,\" says Rachel Clifton. \"But honestly, I am so brain dead with about 30 sets of expenses on my desk, I can't think of anything interesting to say.  I know - no great change etc etc.\"</p><!-- Block 92 --><p><strong>65th over: Bangladesh 173-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 61, Mushfiqur Rahim 36)</strong> Alastair Cook tries to make something happen by giving the ball to Jonathan Trott. He almost succeeds, but Mushfiqur's loose drive flies wide of Swann in the gully and away for four. \"I've got rellies arriving later – has anyone got any tips on how I can I get my American father-in-law interested in the current Test series?\" asks the not remotely pseudonymous Paul van Stratten. \"Obviously I'm recording Sky's highlights so we can go through every play, but in the past he's struggled with the notion of a declaration, never mind two in the same match. He's also been a little baffled by LBW, extras and sledging, oddly.\"</p><!-- Block 93 --><p><strong>66th over: Bangladesh 177-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 65, Mushfiqur Rahim 36)</strong> A fine shot from Siddique, who smacks a leg-stump delivery from Broad over midwicket for four with a wee bit of contempt. Broad looks really weary.  \"OK,\" says Martin Wright. \"Well since you're begging for input, let me pause for a moment from my task of reporting on the finer points of Kenyan slurry management to suggest that the best thing for Test cricket now would be a stirring Bangladeshi counter attack brought to a shuddering end by a Swann hat-trick with the score on 511 for seven (Swann: 250-50-300-7), to leave England victors by a single run, Test cricket in the sub-continent reborn, IPL condemned as sooo 2009, trebles all round.\"</p><!-- Block 94 --><p><strong>67th over: Bangladesh 178-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 65, Mushfiqur Rahim 37)</strong> Trott thought Mushfiqur had trod on his stumps as he pulled a single, but it was actually Prior who had inadvertently dislodged the leg bail. \"Re: the 63rd over,\" begins Daniel Herman. \"So desperate were you to evidence a readership, you got the link wrong. Amusing.\" <em>IS IT?</em> (The link has been corrected now.)</p><!-- Block 95 --><p><strong>68th over: Bangladesh 182-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 66, Mushfiqur Rahim 40)</strong> Pietersen replaces Broad, so now we have Pietersen and Trott in tandem. With the ball. Nothing happens. Here's an email from our old OBO friend Pop E. McNee: \"If Martin Brown insists on dabbling with IPL, the only team he should support is that mangy dog that spent the whole of yesterday considering doing some fielding around the ropes. It was like the Ghost of Cricket Past, made into a doggy manifestation. And somehow it had scaled a ten-foot barbed-wire fence (trying Imperial for the day).\"</p><!-- Block 96 --><p><strong>69th over: Bangladesh 182-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 66, Mushfiqur Rahim 40)</strong> Bresnan replaces Trott, but this is meandering towards the close (just 20 minutes to go). \"Can any of your thousands of overseas readers tell me how to see the third series of Lark Rise to Candleford in Italy?\" asks Finbar Anslow. \"BBC's xenophobic iPlayer is blocking me.\" You misspelt 'twos'.</p><!-- Block 97 --><p><strong>70th over: Bangladesh 183-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 66, Mushfiqur Rahim 41)</strong> KP is bowling around the wicket to the right-handed Mushfiqur, who drives a single. \"Any chance of going ball by ball?\" sniggers James Wrout.</p><!-- Block 98 --><p><strong>71st over: Bangladesh 184-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 66, Mushfiqur Rahim 42)</strong> Mushfiqur Rahiim wears a good bouncer from Bresnan right on the breastbone. That woke everyone up for a few seconds. <br />\"This close to the end, shall we rate the newcomers?\" asks Scott W, before ploughing on anyway. \"M A Carberry - Who doesn't want him to succeed? But succeed he hasn't. Extra mark for looking so dashing. 2/5<br />T T Bresnan - Who doesn't want him to succeed? But succeed he hasn't. Extra mark for doing stuff with the old ball. 2/5<br />S T Finn - Who doesn't want him to succeed? But succeed he hasn't. Extra mark for being young and not Asian so therefore might have a future with England. 2/5<br />If this seems particularly venomous, bear in mind that I love each and every one of these men. It's just slightly depressing that even if they did really, really well there would always be the caveat attached that they did really, really well <em>against Bangladesh</em>. Brass tacks: has either excelled? No.\" Either? Eh?</p><!-- Block 99 --><p><strong>72nd over: Bangladesh 185-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 66, Mushfiqur Rahim 43)</strong> Here comes Graeme Swann for a mini-spell before the close. He is going to be hideously stiff tomorrow morning, and no that isn't meant in a fnarr fnarr sense. Mushfiqur tickles a single off the pads. Siddique, who has been stuck on 66 since the days when Wilson Phillips topped the charts with 'Hold On', blocks the rest of the over. \"Pop E.!!!! Pop E.!!!!! How very very dare you. last time I will be nice when you read tinterweb vitriol. Poppy Eleanor McNee,\" writes Poppy McNee.</p><!-- Block 100 --><p><strong>73rd over: Bangladesh 189-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 66, Mushfiqur Rahim 47)</strong> Bresnan is a touch short and Mushfiqur back-cuts him nicely for four. He's a very good player. Mushfiqur pulls away from the next ball because of movement behind the bowler's arm, but Bresnan goes through with it anyway and nails middle stump. \"Not quite the same as bowler encouragement but I was once batting with my friend Dave who takes his cricket quite seriously,\" says Ian Truman. \"The opposition had an Aussie bowler, who, as Dave was looking round the field, came out with the cracker 'What's the matter, Pom? Looking for your mommy?' As a result I was reduced to a fit of the giggles, which angered Dave sufficiently for him to drill the next ball straight back at my head at the non-striker's end, resulting in an easy caught and bowled. The bowler at least had the decency to thank me for my assistance in the dismissal.\" That is a pretty good sledge. Pr-etty, pr-etty, pr-etty, pr-etty, pr-etty good. I particularly like what I imagine to be a nice contemptuous pause before he spits out the word 'Pom'.</p><!-- Block 101 --><p><strong>74th over: Bangladesh 191-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 68, Mushfiqur Rahim 47)</strong> Siddique steers Swann's last ball of the day for two. \"If we take your selective stats logic to its meandering but unavoidable conclusion then we should only quote the player's stats against the team he is currently playing,\" says Mark Richards. \"Why not have a squad of 23 and pick the best 11 statwise? Only problem is Bell will only then play against Bangladesh.\" You call that a <em>pro</em>blem?</p><!-- Block 102 --><p><strong>75th over: Bangladesh 191-5 (chasing 513; Junaid Siddique 68, Mushfiqur Rahim 47)</strong> \"I can't believe people are saying Beckham will miss the World Cup,\" says Ian Copestake. \"Can't he get Sky where he lives?\" Anyway, that's the end of the day's play. I'd like to say it's been funny. I'd like to say it's been emotional. It hasn't. But it might be tomorrow if rain and/or Bangladesh's lower-order batsmen secure the most improbable of draws. It's highly unlikely, but no longer entirely unthinkable. Thanks for the ones of emails; see you tomorrow morning for the final day's play. I'll leave you with this email from David Hopps:</p><blockquote><p>I've just managed to tear myself away from the cricket to check my emails and I've found one from an 18-year-old from Adelaide who is looking for a club for the summer.

I am aware of it but I have not studied it thoroughly. I will take time during my country tour to study it.\"</p><p>According to New Vision newspaper, he added that the problem could be blamed on doctors stealing drugs, other corrupt practices in hospitals or cultural sensitivities that meant women were not able to give birth in hospitals. He said he had \"established a team in my office to arrest these culprits\" of corruption, but did not appear to elaborate any further.</p><p>Last week, the deputy parliamentary speaker called for a separate ministry to be created to focus on maternal health to identify the needs and challenges women face.

Nestling below an escarpment of the Rift Valley, the development is far from finished, but the plastic and steel structure already stretches over 20 hectares – the size of 20 football pitches.</p><p>The farm manager shows us millions of tomatoes, peppers and other vegetables being grown in 500m rows in computer controlled conditions. Spanish engineers are building the steel structure, Dutch technology minimises water use from two bore-holes and 1,000 women pick and pack 50 tonnes of food a day. Within 24 hours, it has been driven 200 miles to Addis Ababa and flown 1,000 miles to the shops and restaurants of Dubai, Jeddah and elsewhere in the Middle East.</p><p>Ethiopia is one of the hungriest countries in the world with 2.8 million people needing food aid, but paradoxically the government is offering at least 3m hectares of its most fertile land to rich countries and some of the world's most wealthy individuals to export food for their own populations.</p><p>The 1,000 hectares of land which contain the Awassa greenhouses are  leased for 99 years to a Saudi billionaire businessman, Ethiopian-born Sheikh Mohammed al-Amoudi, one of the 50 richest men in the world. His Saudi Star company plans to spend up to $2bn acquiring and developing 500,000 hectares of land in Ethiopia in the next few years. So far, it has bought four farms and is already growing wheat, rice, vegetables and flowers for the Saudi market. It expects eventually to employ more than 10,000 people.</p><p>But Ethiopia is only one of 20 or more African countries where land is being bought or leased for intensive agriculture on an immense scale in what may be the greatest change of ownership since the colonial era.</p><p>An <em>Observer</em> investigation estimates that up to 50m hectares of land – an area more than double the size of the UK – has been acquired in the last few years or is in the process of being negotiated by governments and wealthy investors working with state subsidies. The data used was collected by Grain, the International Institute for Environment and Development, the International Land Coalition, ActionAid and other non-governmental groups.</p><p>The land rush, which is still accelerating, has been triggered by the worldwide food shortages which followed the sharp oil price rises in 2008, growing water shortages and the European Union's insistence that 10% of all transport fuel must come from plant-based biofuels by 2015.</p><p>In many areas the deals have led to evictions, civil unrest and complaints of \"land grabbing\".</p><p>The experience of Nyikaw Ochalla, an indigenous Anuak from the Gambella region of Ethiopia now living in Britain but who is in regular contact with farmers in his region, is typical. He said: \"All of the land in the Gambella region is utilised. Each community has and looks after its own territory and the rivers and farmlands within it. It is a myth propagated by the government and investors to say that there is waste land or land that is not utilised in Gambella.</p><p>\"The foreign companies are arriving in large numbers, depriving people of land they have used for centuries. There is no consultation with the indigenous population. The deals are done secretly. The only thing the local people see is people coming with lots of tractors to invade their lands.</p><p>\"All the land round my family village of Illia has been taken over and is being cleared. People now have to work for an Indian company. Their land has been compulsorily taken and they have been given no compensation. People cannot believe what is happening. Thousands of people will be affected and people will go hungry.\"</p><p>It is not known if the acquisitions will improve or worsen food security in Africa, or if they will stimulate separatist conflicts, but a major World Bank report due to be published this month is expected to warn of both the potential benefits and the immense dangers they represent to people and nature.</p><p>Leading the rush are international agribusinesses, investment banks, hedge funds, commodity traders, sovereign wealth funds as well as UK pension funds, foundations and individuals attracted by some of the world's cheapest land.</p><p>Together they are scouring Sudan, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Malawi, Ethiopia, Congo, Zambia, Uganda, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Mali, Sierra Leone, Ghana and elsewhere. Ethiopia alone has approved 815 foreign-financed agricultural projects since 2007. Any land there, which investors have not been able to buy, is being leased for approximately $1 per year per hectare.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, along with other Middle Eastern emirate states such as Qatar, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi, is thought to be the biggest buyer. In 2008 the Saudi government, which was one of the Middle East's largest wheat-growers, announced it was to reduce its domestic cereal production by 12% a year to conserve its water. It earmarked $5bn to provide loans at preferential rates to Saudi companies which wanted to invest in countries with strong agricultural potential .</p><p>Meanwhile, the Saudi investment company Foras, backed by the Islamic Development Bank and wealthy Saudi investors, plans to spend $1bn buying land and growing 7m tonnes of rice for the Saudi market within seven years. The company says it is investigating buying land in Mali, Senegal, Sudan and Uganda. By turning to Africa to grow its staple crops, Saudi Arabia is not just acquiring Africa's land but is securing itself the equivalent of hundreds of millions of gallons of scarce water a year. Water, says the UN, will be the defining resource of the next 100 years.</p><p>Since 2008 Saudi investors have bought heavily in Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia and Kenya. Last year the first sacks of wheat grown in Ethiopia for the Saudi market were presented by al-Amoudi to King Abdullah.</p><p>Some of the African deals lined up are eye-wateringly large: China has signed a contract with the Democratic Republic of Congo to grow 2.8m hectares of palm oil for biofuels. Before it fell apart after riots, a proposed 1.2m hectares deal between Madagascar and the South Korean company Daewoo would have included nearly half of the country's arable land.</p><p>Land to grow biofuel crops is also in demand. \"European biofuel companies have acquired or requested about 3.9m hectares in Africa. This has led to displacement of people, lack of consultation and compensation, broken promises about wages and job opportunities,\" said Tim Rice, author of an ActionAid report which estimates that the EU needs to grow crops on 17.5m hectares, well over half the size of Italy, if it is to meet its 10% biofuel target by 2015.</p><p>\"The biofuel land grab in Africa is already displacing farmers and food production. The number of people going hungry will increase,\" he said. British firms have secured tracts of land in Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria and Tanzania to grow flowers and vegetables.</p><p>Indian companies, backed by government loans, have bought or leased hundreds of thousands of hectares in Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Senegal and Mozambique, where they are growing rice, sugar cane, maize and lentils to feed their domestic market.</p><p>Nowhere is now out of bounds. Sudan, emerging from civil war and mostly bereft of development for a generation, is one of the new hot spots. South Korean companies last year bought 700,000 hectares of northern Sudan for wheat cultivation; the United Arab Emirates have acquired 750,000 hectares and Saudi Arabia last month concluded a 42,000-hectare deal in Nile province.</p><p>The government of southern Sudan says many companies are now trying to acquire land. \"We have had many requests from many developers. Negotiations are going on,\" said Peter Chooli, director of water resources and irrigation, in Juba last week. \"A Danish group is in discussions with the state and another wants to use land near the Nile.\"</p><p>In one of the most extraordinary deals, buccaneering New York investment firm Jarch Capital, run by a former commodities trader, Philip Heilberg, has leased 800,000 hectares in southern Sudan near Darfur. Heilberg has promised not only to create jobs but also to put 10% or more of his profits back into the local community. But he has been accused by Sudanese of \"grabbing\" communal land and leading an American attempt to fragment Sudan and exploit its resources.</p><p>Devlin Kuyek, a Montreal-based researcher with Grain, said investing in Africa was now seen as a new food supply strategy by many governments. \"Rich countries are eyeing Africa not just for a healthy return on capital, but also as an insurance policy. Food shortages and riots in 28 countries in 2008, declining water supplies, climate change and huge population growth have together made land attractive. Africa has the most land and, compared with other continents, is cheap,\" he said.</p><p>\"Farmland in sub-Saharan Africa is giving 25% returns a year and new technology can treble crop yields in short time frames,\" said Susan Payne, chief executive of Emergent Asset Management, a UK investment fund seeking to spend $50m on African land, which, she said, was attracting governments, corporations, multinationals and other investors. \"Agricultural development is not only sustainable, it is our future. If we do not pay great care and attention now to increase food production by over 50% before 2050, we will face serious food shortages globally,\" she said.</p><p>But many of the deals are widely condemned by both western non-government groups and nationals as \"new colonialism\", driving people off the land and taking scarce resources away from people.</p><p>We met Tegenu Morku, a land agent, in a roadside cafe on his way to the region of Oromia in Ethiopia to find 500 hectares of land for a group of Egyptian investors. They planned to fatten cattle, grow cereals and spices and export as much as possible to Egypt. There had to be water available and he expected the price to be about 15 birr (75p) per hectare per year – less than a quarter of the cost of land in Egypt and a tenth of the price of land in Asia.</p><p>\"The land and labour is cheap and the climate is good here. Everyone – Saudis, Turks, Chinese, Egyptians – is looking. The farmers do not like it because they get displaced, but they can find land elsewhere and, besides, they get compensation, equivalent to about 10 years' crop yield,\" he said.</p><p>Oromia is one of the centres of the African land rush. Haile Hirpa, president of the Oromia studies' association, said last week in a letter of protest to UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon that India had acquired 1m hectares, Djibouti 10,000 hectares, Saudi Arabia 100,000 hectares, and that Egyptian, South Korean, Chinese, Nigerian and other Arab investors were all active in the state.</p><p>\"This is the new, 21st-century colonisation. The Saudis are enjoying the rice harvest, while the Oromos are dying from man-made famine as we speak,\" he said.</p><p>The Ethiopian government denied the deals were causing hunger and said that the land deals were attracting hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign investments and tens of thousands of jobs. A spokesman said: \"Ethiopia has 74m hectares of fertile land, of which only 15% is currently in use – mainly by subsistence farmers. Of the remaining land, only a small percentage – 3 to 4% – is offered to foreign investors. Investors are never given land that belongs to Ethiopian farmers. The government also encourages Ethiopians in the diaspora to invest in their homeland. They bring badly needed technology, they offer jobs and training to Ethiopians, they operate in areas where there is suitable land and access to water.\"</p><p>The reality on the ground is different, according to Michael Taylor, a policy specialist at the International Land Coalition. \"If land in Africa hasn't been planted, it's probably for a reason. Maybe it's used to graze livestock or deliberately left fallow to prevent nutrient depletion and erosion. Anybody who has seen these areas identified as unused understands that there is no land in Ethiopia that has no owners and users.\"</p><p>Development experts are divided on the benefits of large-scale, intensive farming. Indian ecologist Vandana Shiva said in London last week that large-scale industrial agriculture not only threw people off the land but also required chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, fertilisers, intensive water use, and large-scale transport, storage and distribution which together turned landscapes into enormous mono-cultural plantations.</p><p>\"We are seeing dispossession on a massive scale. It means less food is available and local people will have less. There will be more conflict and political instability and cultures will be uprooted. The small farmers of Africa are the basis of food security. The food availability of the planet will decline,\" she says. But Rodney Cooke, director at the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development, sees potential benefits. \"I would avoid the blanket term 'land-grabbing'. Done the right way, these deals can bring benefits for all parties and be a tool for development.\"</p><p>Lorenzo Cotula, senior researcher with the International Institute for Environment and Development, who co-authored a report on African land exchanges with the UN fund last year, found that well-structured deals could guarantee employment, better infrastructures and better crop yields. But badly handled they could cause great harm, especially if local people were excluded from decisions about allocating land and if their land rights were not protected.</p><p>Water is also controversial. Local government officers in Ethiopia told the <em>Observer</em> that foreign companies that set up flower farms and other large intensive farms were not being charged for water. \"We would like to, but the deal is made by central government,\" said one. In Awassa, the al-Amouni farm uses as much water a year as 100,000 Ethiopians.</p><p>• This article was amended on 22 March 2011.

It is not Google Maps or any of its competitors. It is the admirable <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/\" title=\"OpenStreetMap.org\">OpenStreetMap.org</a> (OSM), which is being updated even as I write by volunteers all over the world.</p><p>It is the Wikipedia of the mapping world, and is used by millions of people. Started a little over five years ago in London by Steve Coast, it has steadily built up its database to the point where most of the world has now been mapped by a formidable team of volunteers which is doubling every six months: there were 212,000 at the last count, of whom 10% are active during any one month. At the end of January there were 239 people rebuilding the map of Haiti. For a bird's eye view of operations, go to the <a href=\"http://haiti.ushahidi.com/main\" title=\"Ushahidi\">Ushahidi</a> site.</p><p>When the earthquake happened it was a signal for OSM members around the globe to start downloading satellite images (either freely available or donated by Yahoo) and then to start tracing the outlines of streets on top <a href=\"http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti\" title=\"so a map emerged\">so a map emerged</a>. Volunteers on the ground in Haiti, often using Garmin GPS locators, added vital local information – such as which roads were passable, where the hospitals were situated, where refugee camps were, or walls, pharmacies, hedges and so forth – so rescue workers had an invaluable tool. The result is a new, detailed map that is updated frequently, unlike most commercial maps.</p><p>This is only one of a number of open projects operating in Haiti in what may come to be seen as a seminal moment in the harnessing of the web to help those in need. Others include <a href=\"http://crisiscommons.org/\" title=\"CrisisCommons\">CrisisCommons</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wehaveweneed.org/\" title=\"WeHaveNeed\">WeHaveNeed</a>, <a href=\"http://haiti-orgs.sahanafoundation.org/prod/\" title=\"Sahana\">Sahana</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=5685\" title=\"open source medical\">open source medical software</a> and numerous others, not to mention Twitter tags such as #haiti. One of the problems of using appropriate technology in disaster regions is that bricklayers in Haiti don't know of innovations that might have been pioneered in remote parts of Africa, a problem that <a href=\"http://www.akvo.org/\" title=\"Akvo\">Akvo</a> is trying to solve with regard to water. There are also signs that <a href=\"http://hexayurt.com/\" title=\"Hexayurt\">Hexayurt</a> low-cost housing projects are starting to seed in Haiti.</p><p>OpenStreetMaps is itself at a turning point as it tries to progress from a techie-driven project to one that the ordinary consumer can not only understand but contribute to as well. It suffers from what might be dubbed \"open source syndrome\", a complaint that also affects other OS projects including the Linux operating system – the involvement of skilled volunteers can make the early stages a bit difficult to understand for laypeople.</p><p>However, they have been working on it and it is now much easier to do. A few days ago I added my local curry house to the map (next to a post box someone else had already inserted). All I needed to do was to drag a symbol of a restaurant from the bottom of the screen to where I wanted to put it and then add the words \"Indian Diner\". That in a nutshell is the comparative advantage that OpenStreetMap claims over other online maps. Users can add whatever detail interests them such as <a href=\"http://www.opencyclemap.org/\" title=\"cycle routes\">cycle routes</a>, skateboarding areas, cycle parks, paths through parks – the parts Google can't reach. You have to register (it's free) as a member to alter the map. There is an iPhone app, Mapzen, produced by <a href=\"http://cloudmade.com/\" title=\"Cloudmade\">Cloudmade</a> (company founded by Coast and Nick Black to exploit mapping opportunities) that enables you to insert places of interest you have found on the move. If that takes off, it could lift the project to a new level.</p><p>Often volunteers create maps where there was nothing before as in <a href=\"http://www.mapkibera.org/\" title=\"Kibera\">Kibera</a> in Kenya where basic amenities such as drinking water sources and latrines as well as churches are located to improve living standards and combat illness (eg, where latrines are located too near water sources). The Kibera team have been asked by Ushahidi and Google to include mapping of the slums of Port-au-Prince as part of the relief effort, something that hasn't been done before.</p><p>Gordon Brown, the UK prime minister, has just rediscovered cooperativism as a way of galvanising people to vote Labour. He would have been much more in tune with the times if he had widened it to include the open source movement in all its different aspects. It is one of the most interesting phenomena of our times, a kind of global mutual society. While the likes of Apple and Amazon, though producing fantastic products, are becoming ever more controlling and proprietary, it is sobering to be reminded that one of the basic instincts of human nature – mutual cooperation for no cost – is thriving on a global scale.</p><p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/vickeegan\" title=\"Folllow Vic Keegan on Twitter\"><em>Follow Vic Keegan on Twitter</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2010/2/4/1265283018995/Haiti-map-on-Ushahidi.com-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/04/mapping-open-source-victor-keegan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2010/feb/04/mapping-open-source-victor-keegan","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"United Nations population data for every country in the world ","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-01T00:05:00Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/datablog/2010/feb/01/united-nations-population-world-data","fields":{"body":"<p>How many people live in each country in the world - and how is the world's population growing? </p><p>The best source on earth for the answer is the <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/unpp/index.asp\">United Nations population division</a> and this comprehensive set of data shows estimates for the populations of every country in the world, going from 1950 all the way up to 2050. </p><p>It shows that the developed world will shrink and the developing world will grow.

Using the internet to organise themselves, developers, communications experts and humanitarian organisations created a system to gather emergency requests using text messages that won praise from emergency officials and support from the US State Department. </p><p>Hours after the quake, Josh Nesbit, who heads up a <a href=\"http://medic.frontlinesms.com/\">non-profit using mobile phones to help deliver medical care in Africa</a>, heads sent this tweet:</p><blockquote><p><br />Reaching out to @FrontlineSMS users in #Haiti with hopes of establishing local SMS gateway for http://haiti.ushahidi.com</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/about\">Ushahidi is a crowd-sourced crisis reporting platform</a> that was developed in Kenya to gather reports of violence in the post-election unrest in 2008. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: Patrick Meier with Ushahidi has contacted us with some added detail on the development. He and David Kobia launched the Haiti Ushahidi site shortly after hearing about the quake on 12 January. You can see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jan/29/haiti-crowdsourcing?showallcomments=true#CommentKey:2b852d72-c5d9-4372-bd4f-65b02e4aa78f\">his comment below for more details and links</a>. </p><p>Ushahidi, which means \"testimony\" in Swahili, has been used to gather <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/about\">reports about the swine flu outbreak, monitor elections in India and Mexico and to collect crime reports in Atlanta</a>. </p><p>The platform can handle reports from a number of sources, via email, the web or SMS, making it flexible and very useful even in areas without internet access. Ushahidi worked with teams in <a href=\"http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/01/18/ushahidi-fletcher-situation-room-update/\">Kenya, Uganda and teams in Boston and Washington DC in the United States</a>. </p><p>Using Twitter, Josh got in contact with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Jcastera\">Jean-Marc Castera</a> who was heading to the DigiCel command center, according to <a href=\"http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/01/17/the-4636-sms-shortcode-for-reporting-in-haiti/\">Erik Hersman at Ushahidi</a>. Working with the US State Department they were able to get the 4636 SMS shortcode that had been used for weather information in Haiti.  They <a href=\"http://maryjanemarcus.instedd.org/2010/01/emergency-information-service-launched.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+MaryJaneMarcus+%28Mary+Jane+Marcus%29\">launched the SMS-based emergency information system</a> with the support of the Thomson Reuters Foundation and <a href=\"http://instedd.org/\">technology disaster relief organisation inSTEDD</a> five days after the quake. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-358805121'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/1/29/1264792621860/haitistatetweet.jpg' alt='US State Department announces Haiti emergency number' width='460' height='284' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Ten radio stations still operating in Haiti helped spread the word about the emergency shortcode. They also <a href=\"http://ow.ly/YelC\">quickly put up posters</a>, and the US Department of State helped publicise it, announcing it via their official Twitter account and elsewhere.</p><p>They worked with 10,000 Haitian volunteers to help translate the messages and other volunteers helped to structure \"mountains of data\" coming into the system, <a href=\"http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/01/18/ushahidi-fletcher-situation-room-update/\">Hersman wrote</a>. The volunteers of Mission 4636 posted this on the Ushahidi blog:</p><blockquote><p>We are the volunteer translators of <a href=\"http://www.samasource.org/haiti/\">Mission 4636</a>. We span six time zones and seven languages on any given night. We are students, medics, stay at home mothers, archivists, firefighters, and software developers. We are the quiet force behind Ushahidi Haiti &amp; we give a voice to the lost.</p></blockquote><p>San Francisco startups, <a href=\"http://www.crowdflower.com/\">Crowdflower</a> and <a href=\"http://www.samasource.org/\">Samasource</a>, which specialise in managing tasks for crowdsourcing, helped organise the volunteer efforts, according to <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2010/01/28/team-4636/\">Kim-Mai Cutler at VentureBeat</a>. She also reported that <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kateatstate\">Katie Stanton, an early Google employee who now works in the Office of Innovation at the State Department</a>, \"helped get emergency responders from the U.S. Coast Guard and Red Cross involved\".</p><p>Since it started, Ushahidi has received nearly <a href=\"http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/01/27/separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff/\">100,000 reports concerning Haiti</a>, and organisers are working to create a system, <a href=\"http://swift.ushahidi.com/\">Swift River</a>, to help filter those reports so that the most urgent ones get attention quickly. </p><p>One thing that is impressive about this effort is how distributed, collaborative and organised it is, and they have blogged about how they <a href=\"http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/01/24/volunteers-power-the-open-crowdsourcing-movement/\">kept this volunteer project focused</a>. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: Meier says that work by volunteers at a situation room at the Fletcher School at Tufts University was key in organising these efforts. Again for further detail, you can read his comment below. </p><p>CrisisCamps to help with these projects sprung up in cities around the world, including <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2010/01/20/crisiscamp-london-cr.html\">here in London</a>. </p><h2>A decade of crowdsourced crisis projects</h2><p>Developers also created an application to help collect information on missing people in Haiti. After creating several applications, they came to a decision to focus their efforts on a single app hosted at Google. </p><p>The Haiti Earthquake people finding application is actually the evolution of similar projects that started appearing after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US and rapidly developed after the <a href=\"http://tsunamimissing.blogspot.com/\">Asian Tsunami in late 2004</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2005/09/06/recovery-20-thoughts-on-what-worked-and-failed-on-peoplefinder-so-far/\">Hurricane Katrina PeopleFinder project in 2005</a>, the and the earthquake in Kashmir in 2005.

It has faced down governments, investment banks and the famously litigious Church of Scientology but paying its operating costs (circa $600,000) has proved its undoing. As of today instead of reading government secrets and details of corporate malfeasance all visitors to the site will see <a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/\" title=\"wikileaks.org\">is an appeal for cash</a>. Anyone who cares about freedom of expression should dig deep.</p><p>Wikileaks, with its simple \"keep the bastards honest\" ethos, aims to discourage unethical behaviour by airing governments' and corporations' dirty laundry in public, putting their secrets out there in the public realm. The site won Index on Censorship's 2008 freedom of expression award because it's an invaluable resource for anonymous whistleblowers and investigative journalists.</p><p>Among Wikileaks' recent triumphs are its publication of top-secret internet censorship lists. The blacklists from Australia, Thailand, <a href=\"http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikileaks_tells_Wikinews_why_they_published_Danish_child_porn_censorship_list\" title=\"Wikileaks tells Wikinews why it published Danish child porn censorship list\">Denmark</a> and Norway demonstrate exactly how censorship systems are abused to suppress free expression. The Thai list featured sites criticising the country's royal family and the Australian blacklist turned out to include a school canteen consultancy. Despite its child porn mandate, less than half of the Australian blacklist were linked to paedophilia. Also on the list were satanic and fetish sites, anti-abortion websites, and sites belonging to a kennel operator and a dentist. Publication highlighted the lack of transparency in the process and gave impetus to the \"<a href=\"http://nocleanfeed.com/\" title=\"nocleanfeed.com\">No Clean Feed</a>\" campaign which opposes the Australian government's internet filter proposals.</p><p>But Wikileaks is not just a tool for journalists, it allows ordinary Kenyans to read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/aug/31/kenya.topstories3\" title=\"Guardian: The looting of Kenya\">a confidential report</a> detailing the billions their former president allegedly siphoned from the country's coffers. Its repository includes controversial military documents including the US rules of engagement in Iraq and an operating manual issued to army officers in Guantánamo Bay. It has put corporations on notice that the costs of unethical behaviour are immeasurable in PR terms because it amplifies <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/mar/20/streisand-effect-internet-law\" title=\"Guardian: The Streisand effect: Secrecy in the digital age\">the Streisand effect</a>, the social media phenomenon that punishes those who use the courts to suppress or censor information, by ensuring it has a much wider reach.</p><p>Some have dismissed the site as a snooper's charter. Many were outraged by its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/deadlineusa/2008/sep/17/uselections2008.sarahpalin\" title=\"Guardian: Wikileaks posts a hack of Palin's email account\">publication of Sarah Palin's hacked emails</a> which included private email addresses and Palin's family photographs. These critics tended to overlook that the emails also provided clear evidence that Palin was using private email accounts for state business.</p><p>Wikipedia democratises news and information, allowing the public to access secret information that once would have been limited to the chateratti. Had the Trafigura case occurred five years earlier, most journalists would have been able to access the secret report at the heart of the case, but Wikileaks enables everyone to read it. The superinjunction taken out by Trafigura was so comprehensive that of 293 articles about the suppressed report, only 11 dared to link to it or told the public where they could access it. If Wikileaks didn't exist, it is possible that Trafigura's management <a href=\"http://www.journalism.co.uk/5/articles/536178.php\" title=\"www.journalism.co.uk: Superinjunction was lifted after the horse had bolted\">may have clung to their injunction</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/22/in-praise-of-wikileaks\" title=\"Comment is free: In praise of Wikileaks\">For fear of compromising its integrity</a> Wikileaks doesn't accept funding from corporations or governments.

journalist and author, once made a spiky defence of Johannesburg in a British newspaper.</p><p>\"Foreigners think we are nuts, coming back to a doomed city on a damned continent, but there is something you do not understand: it is boring where you are,\" he wrote a decade ago. \"You will probably live longer than us and acquire more possessions, but there is no ferment in your societies, no excitement, no edge. Your newspapers are bland and your politics are inconsequential, so many storms in teacups.\"</p><p>Malan, author of one of South Africa's seminal texts, My Traitor's Heart, was asked how he spent an ideal day in his home city. In the afternoon, he said, he often took visitors to the Sterkfontein Caves, a world heritage site about an hour out of town.</p><p>He explained: \"If there is a possibility that Johannesburg was once the Garden of Eden, then our ancestors would have lived there 150,000 to 200,000 years ago.\"</p><p>The city of Johannesburg has many qualities but prelapsarian innocence isn't one of them. In search of paradise, I set out to the Sterkfontein Caves, set in an area named, with arresting lack of understatement, the Cradle of Humankind.</p><p>Just 40km from the city of townships, skyscrapers and casinos, an expanse of highveld grassland and mixed woodland conceals secrets of our beginnings. The Cradle, spanning 47,000 hectares in the Witwatersrand Basin, is one of the world's most important prehistoric treasures, not for its pleasant but unremarkable surface, but for the 12 major fossil sites below.</p><p>The dolomitic hills are 2.6bn years old – more than half the age of the Earth itself. The bedrock was once an ancient sea floor and contains the fossils of blue-green algae, some of the earliest life on the planet. Later, dinosaurs ruled the roost here, then, 3m years ago, our ancestors arrived.</p><p>Sterkfontein is the world's longest-running archaeological excavation, with digging continuous since 1966. It has produced more than a third of the world's early hominid fossils, crucial links in the evolutionary chain to modern humans. Its riches are rivalled only by finds in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania.</p><p>Visits to the caves begin with a modern glass centre containing geology lessons, eerie mannequins of man-apes and quotations from Richard Dawkins.</p><p>A tour guide led us out and down a damp stairway into caverns, following in the footsteps of miners, as so often in Gauteng province. The arrival of prospectors looking for lime in 1896 was both a curse and a blessing. Many fossils were probably blown up or hacked to destruction and lost, our guide explained. But if it wasn't for the mining, she said, we might not have found the caves at all.</p><p>One of the star finds at Sterkfontein was \"Mrs Ples\". The 2.5m-year-old perfectly preserved skull has been identified as an intermediate species between ape and human. Along with the \"Taung child\", discovered 23 years earlier, it helped to confirm Charles Darwin's conclusion that our roots are in Africa.</p><p>Mrs Ples was found in 1947 by Robert Broom, born into poverty in Scotland, who controversially didn't spare the dynamite to get at his fossils.</p><p>In 1997 there came another sensational discovery, the world's most complete pre-human fossil. It was dubbed \"Little Foot\" because its body parts were smaller than other adult finds and hailed as \"the fossil that could rewrite human history\".</p><p>Wandering through the cool, dark caves, I looked up at a gate behind which the excavation of Little Foot continued. Around me were the jagged walls and roof, soaring majestically above our heads like nature's cathedral. The rocks had been worn into random shapes by the millennia. One, said the guide, shining a torch, looked like the trunk and ears of an elephant.</p><p>In a crevice, crystals glittered in the torchlight. A thrown stone splashed in an underground lake and sent out ripples. Stalactites and stalagmites grown up and down over aeons touched and merged into one. Fragments of limestone drooped from the darker rock like flecks of shaving foam or weeping willows.</p><p>\"God is great,\" said one member of the tour group.</p><p>The closest I felt to Indiana Jones was pushing myself through tiny gaps and narrow passages, either by samba dancing or curling up to the size of Little Foot itself. I emerged back on the surface and followed a path that allows you to see the ongoing excavations from above.</p><p>The museum shop has an excellent book, Field Guide to the Cradle of Humankind. It contains a foreword by Thabo Mbeki, the former president of South Africa, who never missed a chance to hymn the African renaissance and attack the crimes of colonialism.</p><p>Mbeki argues that, \"having given birth to humanity, we must reverse the many years of dehumanisation that have characterised our recent past\". He goes on to list reasons for Africans to be proud:</p><p>• Africa is the oldest and most enduring of all the continents.</p><p>• The earliest living organism discovered thus far, 3.6bn years old, comes from Barberton in Mpumalanga, South Africa.</p><p>• The earliest dinosaur egg was found in South Africa.</p><p>• The Karoo in South Africa has an unparalleled sequence of fossil deposits.</p><p>• South Africa and other African countries have yielded fossils that prove humans originated in Africa, and that it was here that they first walked on two feet and developed the ability to adapt continuously to changing environs.</p><p>• It was on the African continent that our early human ancestors developed larger brains relative to other primates.</p><p>• Modern technology originated in east Africa, where the first stone tools were manufactured and used.</p><p>• Our early human ancestors first controlled and made fire in South Africa.</p><p>Looking around the group, at faces from Asia, Europe and the Americas, our tour guide said simply: \"Welcome home, everyone.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/1/15/1263563017679/A-group-of-tourists-are-g-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/15/sterkfontein-caves-south-africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/jan/15/sterkfontein-caves-south-africa","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Ethiopia – country of the silver sickle – offers land dirt cheap to farming giants","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-15T00:05:39Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2010/jan/15/ethiopia-sells-land-farming-giants","fields":{"body":"<p>This is a country of the bent back and  the silver sickle, where virtually all the crops have felt the calloused fingers of the peasant farmer working his tiny  parcel of state-owned land. The ox pulls the plough and the donkey the cart, and fertiliser counts as agricultural technology.</p><p>Chugging into this picture on a bright green John Deere tractor came Hanumantha Rao, a former sugarcane farmer from India who is at the forefront of a revolution sweeping through Ethiopian farming. He hurried up to a hilltop on his company's farm in Bako, four hours' drive from the capital, Addis Ababa, and swept out an arm to indicate the land he has leased from the government: 11,000 hectares to grow rice, maize and oil palms.</p><p>In the fields below, boreholes were being sunk and roads graded. An airstrip will soon allow for a crop-spraying plane. Besides the new tractor Rao had been riding on that morning, there were 30 more on site. That was not many, he insisted, and neither was the farm especially large.</p><p>Further west in Gambella, Karuturi Global, the listed Indian horticulture company that employs Rao, is bringing in 1,000 new tractors to work the 300,000 hectares it has leased – making it one of the biggest farms in the Horn of Africa, if not the continent. \"It is  120 kilometres [75 miles] wide,\" Rao  said proudly. \"Three hours to cross by Jeep.\"</p><p>Ethiopia's great land lease project is moved swiftly ahead. In an effort to introduce large-scale commercial farming to the country, the government is offering up vast chunks of fertile farmland to local and foreign investors at almost giveaway rates. By 2013, 3m hectares of idle land is expected to have been allotted – equivalent to more than one fifth of the current land under cultivation in the country.</p><p>The move is part of a wider trend that has seen other African and Asian countries seek to take advantage of high global demand and the cost of crops by offering agricultural land to foreign companies, private equity funds and governments, particularly those of import-dependent Gulf countries.</p><p>If done properly, the investments have the potential to increase local  food availability and create badly  needed jobs. If not – as was the case with the attempt by the South Korean firm Daewoo to lease half of Madagascar's arable land to grow corn for export in 2008, a deal many saw as 21st- century colonialism – they could prove disastrous.</p><p>In a food-insecure country such as Ethiopia, where several million people rely on food aid, the idea of offering fertile land to outsiders has raised concerns. But government officials point out that Ethiopia has vast reserves of underused land – 60m hectares of the country's 74m hectares suitable for agriculture is not cultivated – and insist no local farmers will be adversely affected. Esayas Kebede, investment support co-ordinator at the agriculture ministry, said that foreign companies were essential for the move from subsistence to commercial farming, a key part of the country's development strategy.</p><p>\"There is no crop that won't grow in Ethiopia but we cannot produce quantity and quality. Why? It's a vicious cycle of the lack of capital and technology,\" he said. \"So leasing land is a real opportunity for us.\"</p><p>So too for Karuturi. The Bangalore-based company, which is the world's largest grower of roses, has negotiated an extraordinarily good deal with the government. For its farm in Bako, Karuturi is paying no rent for six years and then only 135 birr (£6.50) per hectare per year for the remainder of the 50-year lease. In Gambella, a remote and sparsely populated region close to Sudan, the rent is only 15 birr per hectare (73p).</p><p>The company believes the potential for large profits is so great that it plans to invest nearly $1bn in its Ethiopian agricultural operations, according to managing director Sai Ramakrishna Karuturi. Within eight years, he hopes to be producing 3m tonnes of cereals – mostly maize and rice – a year on the Gambella farm, as well as palm oil and sugar. Some of the produce will be sold in Sudan and Kenya – where the company is in talks with the US Agency for International Development to build grain silos at a border town. Like all the foreign land investors in Ethiopia, the company is free to export as much of its produce as it likes, but Sai Ramakrishna Karuturi said most would be sold domestically, where there is a ready market.</p><p>\"Ethiopia is a food importer and will continue to be for some time. With the high cost of transportation in Africa, it does not make sense for us to try to export beyond the region.\"</p><p>As with land, labour is also extremely cheap. The minimum wage in Ethiopia is about 8 birr (39p) a day. Karuturi, which hopes eventually to employ 20,000 people on its two farms, says it pays 10 birr (49p) a day and provides meals to its workers.</p><p>Rao, general manager of the Bako farm, said there was no shortage of locals desperate for jobs. \"People here are very poor. They would work for 1 birr, and no one else pays more than 5 birr. So we are paying double.\"</p><p>Outside the farm gates, the feeling about Karuturi among  peasant farmers was mixed. The company's 11,000 hectares were fallow before it arrived – the black clay soil is rich in nutrients but difficult to work without a mechanical plough – but some locals had grazed their cattle there and used to cross the farm to the nearest river, which is no longer possible.</p><p>Teresa Agassa, a 38-year-old man in gumboots who works a one-hectare plot, said it was good that some local people now had jobs – even if the wage was too small. But he spoke enviously of Karuturi's tractors.</p><p>\"They're only for the company's  benefit. Maybe there can also be benefits for us – but we will only know in the future.\"</p><h2>Ethiopia's farming revolution</h2><p>In the late 1970s Ethiopia's communist regime nationalised all land, and private ownership remains outlawed. The millions of small-scale farmers work under licence from the state, and most plots are one hectare or less, which has hampered efforts to improve food security. But the centralised tenure system has made it easy for the government to offer hundreds of idle farms to investors at cheap rates. A detailed database contains information on soil types, weather patterns, the nearest rivers, and suitable crops. The agriculture ministry is advertising 1.68 million hectares of land in the Benishangul-Gumuz, South Omo and Gambella regions. The greatest interest has come from India and Saudi Arabia, including Saudi Star Agricultural Development, which is growing 10,000 hectares of rice in Gambella. Firms from other Arab countries, and from China, Japan and the US have also expressed strong interest in leasing land.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/1/14/1263492801127/Workers-at-an-11000ha-far-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/15/ethiopia-sells-land-farming-giants","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/jan/15/ethiopia-sells-land-farming-giants","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-12T00:05:16Z","sectionId":"theguardian","id":"theguardian/2010/jan/12/corrections-clarifications","fields":{"body":"<p>• A summary headlined <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/10/sub-zero-grit-supplies-snow\" title=\"Fatalities: Icy roads, avalanches and hypothermia claim 27 lives\">Fatalities: Icy roads, avalanches and hypothermia claim 27 lives</a>, 11 January, page 9 should have named the mountaineer who lost his life on 30 December as Rupert Rosedale, rather than Nicholas Rosedale.</p><p>• A column about the ball-tampering controversy in the South Africa-­England Test match (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2010/jan/09/england-ball-tampering-accusations-icc-stuart-broad\">Let the third umpire decide</a>, 9 January, page 9, Sport) stated incorrectly that the International Cricket Council's regulations require the opposing team to complain about alleged ball-tampering.

However, they suffer the consequences the most.

In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uganda\" title=\"The Guardian: Uganda\">Uganda</a>, this year the country will post its fourth successive poor harvest of first season crops. In countries such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/somalia\" title=\"The Guardian: Somalia\">Somalia</a>, half of the population now depends on food aid.</p><p>Many nomadic peoples in East Africa are in a battle for survival because of increasingly severe and frequent droughts. New conflicts are arising in places such as Uganda, northern <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kenya\" title=\"The Guardian: Kenya\">Kenya</a> and Ethiopia, this time over access to increasingly rapidly diminishing water sources.</p><p>The World Bank, in its April 2009 report <a href=\"http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;theSitePK=469372&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000158349_20090414102048\" title=\"World Bank report\">Sea-level rise and storm surges: a comparative analysis of impacts in developing countries</a>, in which it compared population, economic and elevation maps to analyse countries most at risk from rising sea levels, identified 10 African countries as the most vulnerable to storm surges. Islands are particularly at risk: the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/seychelles\" title=\"The Guardian: Seychelles\">Seychelles</a> fear that they may lose 60% of their land because of rising sea levels.</p><p>In southwestern Uganda, temperatures have risen so much that there is now a real danger of the return of old pests such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/malaria-prevention\" title=\"The Guardian: malaria\">malaria</a>, and the outbreak of new ones. Staple crops such soya and cassava are at risk.</p><p>It is not surprising then that countries such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sudan\" title=\"The Guardian: Sudan\">Sudan</a>, Ethiopia and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ghana\" title=\"The Guardian: Ghana\">Ghana</a> rejected the final Copenhagen conference document in the strongest terms possible. Lumumba Di-Aping, the lead Sudanese negotiator, said the deal was \"devoid of any sense of responsibility or morality\".</p><p>Many Africans were convinced the final text was cobbled together by rich nations long before the start of the conference. The role of Africans was to turn up, rubber-stamp it and then appear, smiling, next to leaders of the rich countries as props at the photo shoots later. This suspicion was confirmed at the start of the conference when a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/08/copenhagen-climate-summit-disarray-danish-text\" title=\"The Guardian: 'Copenhagen climate summit in disarray after 'Danish text' leak'\">leaked Danish document</a> proposed industrial nations cut fewer emissions, while the developing world should face tougher limits on greenhouse gases. This outraged African negotiators and activists such that many stormed out of the meeting room.</p><p>The final \"deal\", signed by 28 countries, kicked aside a UN-brokered deal that was more inclusive, financially more generous and more sensitive to the needs of African and developing countries – and which was backed by Africans. In Copenhagen, industrial nations have again successfully managed to divide African and developing countries, by co-opting the bigger developing countries, such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa, in private deals.</p><p>Such co-opting often starts with the demonising of these countries: those who insist on a fair deal are being mercilessly portrayed as stubborn obstacles in the march for a greener future, or as much to blame for global problems as industrial nations, and therefore should make the same compromises – and pay for it also. Of course, the big developing countries – China, India, Brazil and South Africa – are not blameless when it comes to polluting the earth.</p><p>Industrial nations also isolated certain African nations into allying with them, either by promising or withdrawing future aid. That is why Sudan and Ethiopia, among the African countries that stand to lose the most from this bad deal, were there among those signing the accord, although they afterwards attacked it as unfair.</p><p>African countries lack the money and access to technology – restricted by patent laws in industrial nations – to counter the effects of climate change, or to build green economies. The offer of $100bn a year by 2020 to be financed by governments and the private sector not only ridiculously lacks the detail, it is simply inadequate. The big fear among African nations is that the financial mathematics to finance the deal is all a con: industrial dangers will just transfer existing aid commitments to this fund, as they did before. It is not surprising that the deal is rather vague on just how the private sector is going to partially finance African and developing countries' efforts to overcome the effects of climate change – as it proposes.</p><p>It is imperative that African and developing countries understand that progressive efforts to tackle climate change in Africa and the developing world are unlikely to happen, unless there is also a parallel reform of the global political, trade and finance rules.</p><p>Yet Africans can take some good also from this climate talk failure. In spite of the divide-and-rule tactics of industrial nations, there are positive signs that African countries may yet be able to unite in seeking solutions to important global problems that affect them. Africans need such a genuine common union.</p><p>Civil society groups in these countries will have to provide the intellectual leadership that is lacking among the political leaders. The political leaders who led the African delegations, many of them ruling their own countries undemocratically, did their countries a disservice.</p><p>In African countries, civil society, together with ordinary citizens and communities, must keep the pressure on their leaders and hold them accountable. They must start national conversations in which their governments must account for what happened in Copenhagen, and how to rectify it.</p><p>In industrial countries, civil society organisations and individuals must expose their leaders' bullying of African countries to their citizens and unmask the blame-shifting (to developing countries) used by their leaders to cover up the bullying. A failed climate change deal is not only bad for citizens of African and developing countries – it is for industrial nations too.</p><p>• William Gumede is co-editor (with Leslie Dikeni) of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Poverty-Ideas-African-Democracy-Intellectuals/dp/1770097759/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1261571421&amp;sr=8-5\" title=\"The Poverty of Ideas\">The Poverty of Ideas </a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2009/12/7/1260176454289/Copenhagen-Climate-Summit-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/23/copenhagen-africa-climate-change-deal","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/23/copenhagen-africa-climate-change-deal","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Africa sees massive growth in mobile web usage","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-22T18:23:42Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2009/dec/22/mobilephones-internet","fields":{"body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>Having swept America and conquered Europe, social networking site Facebook is now spreading rapidly through Africa.</p><p>From the deserts of Libya to the plains of Tanzania•Facebook is fast becoming the continent's most visited mobile site as Africans use their phones to access the internet, according to a new report.</p><p>Even micro-blogging phenomenon Twitter is making an impact, appearing as the ninth most visited mobile internet site in South Africa and Kenya, according to a study by Oslo-based mobile software developer Opera of the top ten 'mobile web' countries in Africa.</p><p>The most popular African destination on the mobile web, is Facebook.

The crowd-sourcing project Ushahidi, for example, was developed in Kenya after the post-election fallout at the beginning of 2008. It maps incidents using information from text messages or online sources, and as the application is open source, it can be used around the world. </p><p>\"What we look for in crowdsourcing is reaching a critical mass of information where communities are dialogging with each other and are able to make sense of the situation due to the increase level of communication going on,\" explains Erik Hersman, the co-founder of Ushahidi. </p><p>Today, <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a> can provide a model for crowd-sourcing projects elsewhere as the issue of how to process and verify massive amounts of information isn't just an African problem. </p><p>To get around this problem Ushahidi has recently launched <a href=\"http://swiftapp.org/\">a project called Swift River </a>which is about gathering as much information as possible and then running it through machine-based algorithms, helping experts to understand the veracity and the level of importance of the gathered information. </p><p>Also visionary is using the mobile phone as a multiple device – a remote control for your house or your car, or as a credit card. </p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0HCW7lyIHQ\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0HCW7lyIHQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>\"The mobile phone is the most important new technology,\" says Mbugua. \"It is accessible. It is used in Kenya as a mobile wallet. A lot of people don't have credit cards or even bank accounts. So since 2007 a service was established that has 8 million users and is used to pay even cab drivers or pubs. Meanwhile there were a couple of international mobile conferences in Kenya.\" </p><p><br />The Africa of today shows that the visionary technological ideas of this century won't be only developed in high-tech countries. Several blogs document this, for example <a href=\"http://appfrica.net/blog/\">Appfrica</a>, <a href=\"http://www.afrigadget.com/\">Afrigadget</a> or <a href=\"http://whiteafrican.com/\">WhiteAfrican</a>. </p><p>They are informative about the inventive ways people in Africa deal with technology, for example finding ways to charge batteries on a continent that has more phones than electricity. </p><p>As energy resources become scarce in the future, the African solutions of today are definitely worth studying. </p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/dec/17/digital-media-mobilephone-usage-africa-leapfroging-ushahidi-swift-river","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/pda/2009/dec/17/digital-media-mobilephone-usage-africa-leapfroging-ushahidi-swift-river","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"Google backs world's fastest internet cable","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-11T10:09:58Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2009/dec/11/google-undersea-cable-asia","fields":{"body":"<p>In little more than a decade, Google has conquered the technology industry and become one of the world's most powerful companies. Its latest undertaking, however, may be one of its most ambitious: a giant undersea cable that will significantly speed up internet access around the globe. </p><p>The Californian search engine is part of a consortium that confirmed its plans to install the new Southeast Asia Japan Cable (SJC) yesterday, the centrepiece of a $400m (£245m) project that will create the highest capacity system ever built. </p><p>Google is undertaking the scheme with a number of Asian telecommunications companies, including Japan's KDDI and India's Reliance Globalcom. The agreement to build the submarine cable was first proposed three years ago, but negotiations finally came to a close on Wednesday as officials signed what they promised was a groundbreaking deal.</p><p>\"We will now be uniquely positioned to provide our customers voice, internet and data services across the entire Asian continent,\" said Punit Garg, the chief executive of Reliance. </p><p>When it opens for business in 2012, the SJC will run 3,000 miles from Singapore to Japan - with branches reaching out to Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand and Guam. In total, it will consist of more than 5,000 miles of cable, sunk deep under the seabed.</p><p>The move is intended to boost the amount of capacity available for phone calls and internet traffic by bringing new. In turn, this should ease any potential congestion and make it easier for communications traffic to route around the world.</p><p>The SJC is set to break records by allowing up to 17 terabits of data to be sent every second - the equivalent of around 250m telephone lines, and large enough to allow the contents of every single book in the British Library to be transferred 20 times per second.</p><p>And as if that was not enough, the line is also upgradeable and could eventually run as fast as 23Tbps - space for another 88m phone lines.</p><p>It is not the first time that Google has made significant investments in the physical infrastructure that underpins the internet.</p><p>Recently, the company took a leading role in developing a parallel project to build the $300m Unity cable, which will run a high-capacity line from Japan to Los Angeles.</p><p>Demand for connectivity has grown drastically in recent years, thanks to increased internet traffic. Research company TeleGeography pinned annual growth between 2002 and 2007 at around 63% per year, and expects demand to double each year until 2012.</p><p>Earlier this year a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jul/23/east-africa-broadband-revolution\">new line running into east Africa was finally completed</a>, promising to bring improved broadband to countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/dec/11/google-undersea-cable-asia","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/dec/11/google-undersea-cable-asia","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Carbon emissions data: can the Copenhagen climate summit bring these down?

These are the figures, and the latest visualisation we've produced.</p><p>Which country is number one in carbon emissions? Up until very recently, it was the US - now, it is indisputedly China, as shown by this data.</p><p>These are the latest figures - up to 2007 - from the respected <a href=\"http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8\">US Energy Information Administration</a>. This has (literally) every country in the world on it and its emissions going back to 1980 — plus we've put on some handy percentage change data and ranking information. </p><p>The curious thing is, we've been here before. Last year we <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/interactive/2008/dec/09/climatechange-carbonemissions \">reported that China had overtaken the US in 2006</a>. But if you look at the figures below, the change now appears to have happened in 2007. What's going on?</p><p>We asked the EIA and this is what they said: </p><blockquote><p>Each year we review the underlying consumption data for petroleum, natural gas, and coal and the flaring data for natural gas and make any necessary revisions.  These, in turn, affect our CO2 emissions estimates.  I think that most of the change for China was due to revisions to our coal consumption data.  Coal consumption is a calculated value based on production, imports, exports, and stock change and when measured in Btus is also affected by the types of coal consumed (i.e. anthracite, bituminous, and lignite).  Data for the most recent year are often preliminary and most subject to revision but data for earlier years are also often revised.  </p></blockquote><p>Of course, these aren't all emissions - just consumption of engergy, which accounts for 60% of the total. But they give a good picture of what is going on.</p><p>Because of the interest, the EIA are going to come up with 2008 figures at the end of this year or early 2010. Then we will see exactly how fast China has grown. In the meantime, as we countdown to Copenhagen, these figures will become even more important.</p><h2>Download the pdf</h2><p>We've added in the %-change since 1990 - the Kyoto benchmark.

offsetting? Fertile ground for ridicule | Leo Hickman","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-03T15:08:00Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/03/population-offsetting","fields":{"body":"<p>\"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/03/carbon-offset-projects-climate-change\" title=\"\">Rich nations to offset emissions with birth control</a>.\" At first sight, I thought it was a satirical headline from <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/index\" title=\"\">the Onion</a>. Good one, I thought: they're imagining carbon offsetting at its most ludicrous extreme.</p><p>But then I read further: \"The scheme, called PopOffsets, understands the connection [between population increase and climate change],\" says the <a href=\"http://www.optimumpopulation.org/\" title=\"\">Optimum Population Trust</a>'s director Roger Martin. \"It offers a practical and sensible response. For the first time ever individuals, companies and organisations will have the opportunity to offset their carbon voluntarily by supporting projects to provide family planning services where there is currently unmet demand.\"</p><p>I believe \"WTF\" is the acronym now favoured when faced with such statements. But before we delve into the rights and wrongs of such a notion, let's at least hear the logic behind it …</p><p><blockquote>Every £4 spent on contraception, it says, saves one tonne of CO2 being added to global warming, but a similar reduction in emissions would require an £8 investment in tree planting, £15 in wind power, £31 in solar energy and £56 in hybrid vehicle technology.</blockquote></p><p>The Optimum Population Trust (OPT), which is supported by environmental grandees such as Sir David Attenborough and James Lovelock, is arguing that, instead of planting tress and the like, it makes much better sense for people in developed nations to offset their emissions by paying for condoms to be handed out in developing nations where birth rates are much higher. To facilitate this, a <a href=\"http://www.popoffsets.com\" title=\"\">website has now been set up</a> where you can calculate your emissions for, say, your \"summer holiday 2009\" and then make a donation which helps pay for contraceptives to be distributed in countries such as India and Kenya. The very first project which will receive OPT funding is Blue Ventures in Madagascar, which, according to the OPT, \"has one of the world's fastest growing populations, with an average fertility rate of over five births per woman and nearly half of its population currently under 15 years of age\".</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2006/mar/28/ethicalliving.lifeandhealth\" title=\"\">I've never really been a fan of offsetting</a>. Ultimately, it just smacks of convenience and displaced guilt. Even some of the travel companies who enthusiastically leapt on the offsetting bandwagon <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8383869.stm\" title=\"\">are now abandoning it</a>, saying it's little more than an illusionary sop. But I do think this latest offsetting hybrid sends out the wrong message altogether and will be largely ridiculed.</p><p>That's not to undermine the genuine concerns of the OPT – even as a father myself, I do think population growth is a subject that is all too often ignored, not just by environmentalists, but the wider world – but I think it might have misjudged this one badly. \"Population offsetting\" – even the name gives me the shivers – smells of warped imperialism, bordering on Brave New World.</p><p>Yes, cold hard logic might lead you to conclude that it makes sense, but if anyone needs a parachute full of condoms and contraceptive pills, it's the developed world where per capita emissions are much, much higher than in places such as Madagascar. If anything, it should be the other way round: the Malagasy should be insisting the condoms are left on our doorsteps, not their own. (To be fair, OPT does make a good stab at answering such criticisms on <a href=\"http://www.popoffsets.com/faq.php\" title=\"\">its \"Your Questions Answered\" page</a>, but it doesn't remove the fact that, as a headline solution, this will make it a laughing stock and, ultimately, damage its cause.)</p><p>Curbing population growth is a near-impossible subject to discuss at the best of times. It is even harder to pick out any workable solutions that don't ultimately lead you down the road towards totalitarianism. People who even dare to raise it as a problem – as the OPT well know – are called all manner of unmentionable things. Quite rightly, a fair response is to ask the doubters: \"So, what would you do then?\" A deafening silence usually follows, and I readily admit that I also can't see how you could ever significantly reduce the world's population – and thereby <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity\" title=\"\">reach a sustainable \"carrying capacity\"</a> – without resorting to tactics that would rightly offend virtually every constituent on the planet.</p><p>So, let's applaud them for at least trying to get this subject into the national debate, but surely it's time to return to the drawing board when you are forced to resort to notions such as population offsetting.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/10/27/1256657599611/Contraceptive-pills-001.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/03/population-offsetting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/03/population-offsetting","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Rich nations to offset emissions with birth control ","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-03T09:51:57Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2009/dec/03/carbon-offset-projects-climate-change","fields":{"body":"<p>Consumers in the developed world are to be offered a radical method of offsetting their carbon emissions in an ambitious attempt to tackle climate change - by paying for contraception measures in poorer countries to curb the rapidly growing global population. </p><p>The scheme - set up by an organisation backed by Sir David Attenborough, the former diplomat Sir Crispin Tickell and green figureheads such as Jonathon Porritt and James Lovelock - argues that family planning is the most effective way to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic global warming.</p><p>Optimum Population Trust (Opt) stresses that birth control will be provided only to those who have no access to it, and only unwanted births would be avoided. Opt estimates that 80 million pregnancies each year are unwanted.</p><p>The cost-benefit analysis commissioned by the trust claims that family planning is the cheapest way to reduce carbon emissions. Every £4 spent on contraception, it says, saves one tonne of CO2 being added to global warming, but a similar reduction in emissions would require an £8 investment in tree planting, £15 in wind power, £31 in solar energy and £56 in hybrid vehicle technology.</p><p>Calculations based on the trust's figures show the 10 tonnes emitted by a return flight from London to Sydney would be offset by enabling the avoidance of one unwanted birth in a country such as Kenya. Such action not only cuts emissions but reduces the number of people who will fall victim to climate change, it says. </p><p>\"The scheme, called PopOffsets, understands the connection [between population increase and climate change],\" says the trust director Roger Martin. \"It offers a practical and sensible response. For the first time ever individuals, companies and organisations will have the opportunity to offset their carbon voluntarily by supporting projects to provide family planning services where there is currently unmet demand.\"</p><p>In papers released with the launch of the offset scheme, the trust claims that reducing CO 2 by 34 gigatonnes would cost about $220bn with family planning, but more than $1tn with low carbon technologies. The 34 gigatonnes is roughly what the world emits in a year, and would be achieved by cutting the projected global population in 2050 by 500 million. </p><p>The world's population, presently 6.8 billion, is increasing by nearly 84 million a year. The growth is equivalent to a new country the size of Germany each year, or a city the size of Birmingham every week. It is expected by the UN to peak at about 9 billion people in 2050. By this time, UN scientists say global carbon emissions must have reduced by at least 80% to avoid dangerous rises in temperature, meaning the carbon footprint of each citizen in 2050 will have to be very low.</p><p>\"The current level of human population growth is unsustainable and places acute pressure on global resources. Human activity is exacerbating global warming, and higher population levels inevitably mean higher emissions and more climate change victims,\" said Martin. </p><p>The giant carbon footprints of developed countries mean prevented births will save far more carbon than those in developing nations.</p><p>However, some development groups opposed the plan. \"We are keen that any money raised [from offsets] help the poorest who are most vulnerable to climate change. [But] it would be misleading if it was spent in this way. It should go to [immediate] things like disaster risk reduction, food security and water,\" said Paul Cook, advocacy director of Tearfund, a faith-based development group. </p><p>Population control is highly contentious in rich and poor countries alike Some, such as Jonathon Porritt, the former Sustainable Development Commission chair, have said promotion of reproductive health is one of the most progressive forms of intervention. \"Had there been no 'one child family' policy in China there would now have been 400 million additional Chinese citizens,\" he has said.</p><p>But other thinkers, such as the Guardian columnist George Monbiot, say global population increase pales into insignificance when compared with the effect of increased consumption and economic growth.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/5/1/1241189506825/Babies-rest-at-the-Poupon-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/03/carbon-offset-projects-climate-change","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/dec/03/carbon-offset-projects-climate-change","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Wikipedia's known unknowns","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-02T18:45:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2009/dec/02/wikipedia-known-unknowns-geotagging-knowledge","fields":{"body":"<p>Are Wikipedia contributors running out of topics to write about? Recently, much has been made of the fact that the growth in the number of new Wikipedia articles has been gradually slowing and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/nov/25/wikipedia-editors-decline\" title=\"Have you stopped editing Wikipedia? And if so, is it doomed?\">number of volunteers apparently falling</a>. But Wikipedia still has much to do: the map above suggests there are still whole continents that remain a virtual \"terra incognita\" and the next explosive growth in the online encyclopedia will come from places that have not previously been represented.</p><p><a href=\"http://zerogeography.blogspot.com/2009/11/mapping-geographies-of-wikipedia.html\" title=\"zerogeography.blogspot.com\">The map</a> represents the roughly half million geotagged Wikipedia articles that fall within the boundaries of any one country. These geotagged articles are either about distinct places (such as cities, buildings, forests) or about events that occurred in distinct places.</p><p>There is clearly a highly uneven geography of information in Wikipedia. The United States has the most articles about places or events (almost 100,000), while some smaller countries such as Tonga have fewer than 10.</p><h2><strong>Stranger than fiction</strong></h2><p>But it's not just size that is correlated with extremely low levels of wiki representation. Almost the entire continent of Africa is geographically poorly represented in Wikipedia. Remarkably, there are more Wikipedia articles written about Antarctica than all but one of the 53 countries in Africa (or perhaps more amazingly, there are more Wikipedia articles written about the fictional places of Middle Earth and Discworld than about many countries in Africa, Asia, and the Americas).</p><p>There are some countries that are crammed with a dense amount of floating virtual information, such as Germany (with an average of one article tagged for every 65 square km), while others remain as virtual deserts, such as Chad (with an average of one tagged article every 17,000 square km).</p><p>Sharp divides between the Global North and the Global South can likewise be seen when looking at the number of geotagged articles per person. Austria, Iceland and Switzerland all have around one geotagged article for every 1,000 people, while in China or Guinea there is just over one article for every 500,000 people.</p><p>It needs to be pointed out that only a relatively small number of Wikipedia articles are geotagged. The main reason for this is that a lot of information simply isn't geotaggable: It wouldn't make sense to assign co-ordinates to the vast majority of articles on topics such as apples or Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles.</p><p>Some explicitly spatial articles do remain untagged. The reason that Burkina Faso has more geotagged articles (1071) than South Africa (945), Kenya (217) and the rest of Africa is probably down to diligent editing rather than more actual content in Burkina Faso.</p><p>However, in all cases, these numbers pale in comparison to the huge number of articles in places such as the US (89,549) and Germany (54,634). So, I'd argue that: (1) the geographic biases in tagged v untagged articles are relatively small; and (2) because those biases exist we should pay more attention to the general patterns of geographic inequalities in content (ie the fact that there is much more content in the Global North than the Global South) than to the relatively minor differences between places.</p><p>Every day, countless decisions are made and countless opinions formed based on information available in Wikipedia. If this weren't the case, the articles on Israel, Kashmir and Taiwan would not host such hotly contested edit wars. Representations within the online encyclopaedia therefore undoubtedly have cultural, economic and political effects.</p><h2><strong>Unexplored territory</strong></h2><p>But what of the places that aren't even represented? We often hear claims that peer-produced information is broader in scope and more accurate than traditional methods of content creation. This is certainly true, particularly for topics that generate a lot of interest such as \"Paris\" or \"New York\". However, as we increasingly rely on (and trust) web 2.0 sources such as Wikipedia, what will be the effects of this new \"terra incognita\" in our shared map of knowledge?</p><p>It may be that when broadband reaches more parts of Africa – helped by the  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/aug/18/east.africa.internet\" title=\"Last piece of fibre-optic jigsaw falls into place as cable links east Africa to grid\">landfall of superfast cables</a> in August – that&nbsp;more people there will start discovering Wikipedia, and that the site will see a second explosion of new editors and articles about places that have so far been ignored. Or it may be that by then Wikipedia will be passed by in favour of something new.</p><p>The answers are unclear, but we should nonetheless acknowledge the significant geographic gaps in an encyclopaedia that is described as having reached its limits. It is conceivable that it will only be a matter of time until a new generation of wannabe Wikipedia editors in Zambia, in Indonesia, and in much of the rest of the world begin to fill in the blank spots and construct dense layers of virtual representation.</p><p>But it is equally conceivable that as peer-produced projects such as Wikipedia become our primary sources of knowledge, we could begin to see permanent information inequalities between different parts of the world. In any case, it is clear that we are far from running out of topics to write about.</p><p>Mark Graham is a Research Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute and blogs at <a href=\"http://zerogeography.blogspot.com\" title=\"zerogeography.blogspot.com\">zerogeography.blogspot.com</a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2007/08/15/wiki-epa-4.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/dec/02/wikipedia-known-unknowns-geotagging-knowledge","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/dec/02/wikipedia-known-unknowns-geotagging-knowledge","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Dubai's financial crisis: how much money do banks lend around the world?","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-30T14:14:42Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/datablog/2009/nov/30/dubai-financial-crisis-debt-uae-data-world1","fields":{"body":"<p>Now that the government of Dubai has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/nov/30/abu-dhabi-stock-market\">forced to guarantee banks' debts</a>, attention has focused on its worldwide exposure.

Afghanistan has the highest infant mortality rate in the world - 257 deaths per 1,000 live births, while 70 percent of the population lacks access to clean water.</p><p>Published twenty years after the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the report shows that one billion children are still deprived of food, shelter or clean water or health care. 24,000 children under the age of five die every day from preventable causes such as pneumonia and malnutrition.</p><p>Unicef said today that Somalia has announced it is to sign the convention, leaving the United States as the only country outside the treaty.</p><p>To go with the report, Unicef has released a comprehensive set of health and population indicators.
