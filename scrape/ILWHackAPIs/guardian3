One of the biggest problems is its membership, which includes too many &quot;stalwards pillars of the establishment&quot;, he added.</p> <p>Foulkes told the House of Lords: &quot;Some of the recent reports have shown the inadequacy of the scrutiny of the intelligence and security committee of those services as it is currently comprised. I&apos;m not surprised, frankly, by what&apos;s happened. For four years I served as the only representative of this house on the nine-person committee and I experienced some of the difficulties of scrutiny of the intelligence services. I had some radical ideas and changes to propose ... but I was surprised that I was summarily removed from that committee by the coalition, but what was even more disturbing is that no Labour peer was appointed by the prime minister in my place.</p> <p>&quot;I have great admiration for the many qualities of the two peers appointed. I doubt however that the Marquis of Lothian and Lord Butler actually have as the top of the list a reputation for radical and challenging questioning. Two more stalwart pillars of the establishment would be harder to find ... The secrecy surrounding the way in which this committee is to be constituted would do MI6 proud. It is not the open procedure that parliament ought to have.</p> <p>&quot;Like any other joint committee, this house should have roughly half the members. I would suggest the committee ought to be increased to 11 members. I think the chair should be a member of the opposition party like the chair of the public accounts committee to give it greater credibility.</p> <p>&quot;I have great respect for the current chair, Sir Malcolm Rifkind – in fact I have known him for 50 years. But it doesn&apos;t honestly instil confidence in the public and in parliament that the committee will undertake radical and effective scrutiny when you&apos;ve got in the chair someone who has so recently [1995-97] been foreign secretary ... In order for it to be seen as effective and impartial, I would suggest the members of the committee need to be chosen by as democratic a procedure as we possibly can devise.&quot;</p> <p>He also pointed out the committee had its investigating staff member taken away from it &quot;because no doubt he was investigating too much&quot;.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T16:39:04.219Z\">at 4.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-527bbab9e4b055987af674f5\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T16:08:10.655Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The appearance of MI5’s Andrew Parker, MI6’s Sir John Sawers and GCHQ’s Sr Iain Lobban before the intelligence and security committee has come to an end. Here are the key points:</p> <p>• <strong>Mark Field, a member of the committee, said the committee had not been aware of all the “intricacies” in the spy programmes revealed by the Guardian and asked for a “comprehensive update” of all collaboration with foreign agencies in a closed session, which Lobban agreed to.</strong> Field said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We were very much aware of your capabilities in the past, but we weren’t aware of the intricacies to which Hazel Blears has just referred. Whilst we appreciate that a lot of this is confidential about the sort of cooperation you have with other overseas agencies, will you give us an assurance that at the earliest opportunity in a closed session of this committee you will give us a comprehensive update on collaborations that were taking place with overseas intelligence agencies?</p> </blockquote> <p>• <strong>Lobban denied that the mass surveillance programmes revealed by Edward Snowden meant the intelligence agencies were reading everyone’s emails or listening to their calls.</strong> “I do not look at the surrounding hay”, he said, using the metaphor of looking for a needle in a haystack. If you are a threat or you are in contact with someone who is a threat you may be monitored, Lobban said. If not, not. If he asked his staff to snoop, “they’d leave the building”, he said. He said the agencies did not do anything outside the law. Parker said over the years governments had offered them greater powers “and we’ve said they’re disproportionate and turned away from them”.</p> <p>• <strong>The Snowden leaks have been “very damaging”, Sawers said.</strong> “They have put our operations at risk … Al-Qaida are lapping it up.” Lobban said terrorist groups in the Middle East and Afghanistan had been discussing the revelations in specific terms and had discussed moving to other “communications packages”. The three chiefs were unwilling to provide more specific examples of this damage in public, although they said they would do so to the MPs in a closed session.</p> <p>• <strong>Asked why the public had not been entitled to know about the mass surveillance programmes and had only found out about them via the Guardian, Lobban said some things were “necessarily secret” and “should remain secret”.</strong> Secret did not mean sinister, he said. Lobban said an “active debate” had been going on even before the Snowden revelations about where the line of secrecy needed to be drawn.</p> <p>• <strong>Asked if the existing framework of oversight for the security services was adequate, Lobban said that was a matter for parliament but he thought it “did a pretty good job”.</strong> But if parliament chose to have a debate and change the laws, that was “fine by him”. Parker expressed frustration that his (closed-door) meetings with the home secretary, the ISC and the intelligence commissioners that make up MI5’s oversight regime did not “get into the public mind”. Oversight was “very rigorous”, Sawers said.</p> <p>• <strong>The number of people who have travelled to Syria from Britain to fight in the civil war and are either still there or have come back is in the low hundreds, Parker said.</strong> Most will not attack Britain, but some might, he said.</p> <p>• <strong>Sawers denied MI6 spied on “everyone”, saying there were only a few countries where the Secret Intelligence Service actually had operations. </strong></p> <p><strong>• Sawers and Parker both said they would never ask a foreign intelligence agency to question someone if they thought that would result in torture.</strong></p> <p><strong>• Parker suggested that the kind of situation where a “junior clerk” such as Edward Snowden could leak so much information was unlikely to happen in the UK.</strong></p> <p><strong>• MI6 is communicating with Russia over the Sochi Olympics and will take cooperation with Moscow forward “step by step”.</strong></p> <p><strong>• Parker said MI5 sometimes recommended people for the government’s anti-radicalisation Prevent programme.</strong></p> <p><strong>• He said there were some terrorist plots during the London Olympics but “they didn’t happen”. There have been 330 prosecutions for international terrorism since 9/11, he said. Thirty-four plots had been disrupted since 7/7.</strong></p> <p><strong>• He rejected the idea that 7/7 represented an “intelligence failure”. </strong></p> <p><strong>• Parker said MI5’s budget was £2bn.</strong></p> <p><strong>• There will be more public sessions with the three spy chiefs in future, Rifkind said he hoped.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527bb391e4b08521f0cfb359\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:38:14.685Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> Legal pressure group Reprieve has called the session a &quot;damp squib&quot; that demonstrates why the ISC gives inadequate oversight of the security services. Its strategic director Cori Crider said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today’s hearing was billed as a grilling, but was nothing more than a damp squib. It gave a clear demonstration, if one were needed, of just how inadequate the ISC is as a watchdog on the intelligence services.</p> <p>One of the many elephants in the room was the UK’s involvement in Libyan rendition and torture. Not one member of the ISC asked about MI6’s role in ‘rendering’ the wives and children of Gaddafi opponents back to the dictator’s prisons in 2004 – an incident of which the ISC was completely unaware when it cleared the services of involvement in rendition and torture in 2007.</p> <p>They also failed to question GCHQ over its role in providing support to the CIA’s covert drone programme – which has killed hundreds of civilians in Pakistan and Yemen, and violates international law.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527bb330e4b055987af674ee\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:35:22.523Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tory MP Dominic Raab has been in touch to say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the first time, intelligence chiefs gave public evidence about the scope of their activities and powers.

It is a big concern, but not as high an operational concern as other parts of the world, Sawers says.</p> <p>Julian Lewis asks about espionage in the UK. Does traditional espionage, say from Russia, still pose a threat? Would it be true to say that everyone is still spying on everyone else?</p> <p>Parker says 10% of his work arises from threats from foreign states, most of that being espionage. “It’s still a lively business here.”</p> <p>There are a range of countries involved, he says.</p> <p>Rifkind asks about the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. </p> <p>Sawers says we have not had the cooperation we sought from the Russians on that case. Recently they have been talking about security for the Sochi Olympics, though. “We will take it forward step by step.”</p> <p>Lewis asks again: would it be true to say that everyone is still spying on everyone else?</p> <p>Sawers says terrorism, cyber, nuclear issues are the vast bulk of what they do. Of course we don’t spy on everyone. There are very few countries where we actively have operations. We are targeting the highest priorities of the government, he says.</p> <p>Rifkind closes by looking forward to more open sessions in future.</p> <p>Sawers wants to have one last word. He says all three of them feel that the great value of the services comes from the great and committed members of staff who work for the agencies. “Our people are the backbone of what we do.”</p> <p>With that the session ends.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527bb1cee4b08521f0cfb357\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:29:19.394Z\">3.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What is the main lesson you have learned from the Iraqi intelligence failings?</p> <p>Sawers says “there were clearly shortcomings back in 2002 and we’ve learnt an enormous amount from those”.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527bb15ee4b0ebad08ff9d47\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:28:12.415Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the context of some of the spy chiefs&apos; comments, it is worth noting that Guardian stories on the Snowden revelations have been published after consultation with the government&apos;s DA Notice committee, with intelligence agencies themselves, or with officials in Whitehall.</p> <p>Following those discussions the Guardian has agreed not to publish certain things, and has made independent decisions to redact certain details, names, locations and operations.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527bb12ce4b0f1cce82090e9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T15:27:03.929Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lord Butler asks if the intelligence community has made a contribution to the tentative detente with Iran over its nuclear programme.</p> <p>Yes, it has, says Sawers.

If there was such an admission, it would be possible to have a debate, he said.</p> <p>&quot;I have argued for a long time that the government should have been more open about the purpose of intelligence and the general ways in an internet age you have to go about accessing intelligence. That debate is perfectly reasonable.&quot;</p> <p>He rejected as nonsense <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/25/leaked-memos-gchq-mass-surveillance-secret-snowden\">claims in the Guardian</a> that one reason why the intelligence agencies had argued against the use of intercept evidence in court trials was because it wished to keep secret the scale of its intelligence gathering.</p> <p>Omand said he was proud of the British collaboration with American intelligence agencies, saying: &quot;We have the brains, they have the money&quot;. He added that it was an open matter of debate about how GCHQ was funded by the US.</p> </blockquote> <p>At last week&apos;s Westminster Hall debate, MPs questioned whether the members of the intelligence and security committee had actually known about the NSA&apos;s Prism internet surveillance programme and GCHQ&apos;s Tempora internet-cable-tapping programme before the Guardian revealed them. George Howarth gave the impression that the MPs had not known, while chair Sir Malcolm Rifkind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/31/nsa-files-mps-debate-oversight-of-the-intelligence-services#block-52727877e4b0ad7c52b6049f\">said</a> the MPs questioning him had no idea whether his committee knew about the programmes because secret information like that had to be kept secret. </p> <p>But this morning Omand said he was sure the ISC would have had detailed briefings on the scale of GCHQ&apos;s activity, but in private. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ISC has now been reconstituted. It is now a proper committee of parliament. They have got new powers. They are on show this afternoon every bit as much as the three heads of agencies.

He has more than 6,000 staff under him and they spend the bulk of the three agencies&apos; combined budget of £2bn.</p> <p>Lobban supports Everton football club, and declares his other interests as cricket, photography, travel and birdwatching.</p> <p>He studied French and German at Leeds University and passed the higher command staff course at the Defence Academy at Shrivenham before joining GCHQ in 1983. GCHQ is also in the lead in fighting cyber wars, and Lobban is appealing to cyberwarriors. &quot;[GCHQ] can offer them a fantastic mission, but … can&apos;t compete with their salaries,&quot; he has said referring to the kind of money offered by private companies. None of the chiefs seeks the spotlight, but Lobban is probably the least well-known of them all preferring to keep himself, and his Cheltenham agency, out of the Whitehall spotlight.</p>  <h2><strong>Andrew Parker - head of MI5</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ab50824c-3b9e-4c5b-b19c-8bd0b0a41163\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/28/1364494813967/Andrew-Parker-008.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Parker\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Parker, head of MI5. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Parker, 50, has been director general of MI5, the domestic security service, which has a staff of 3,900 officers, since April this year. He studied natural sciences at Cambridge University, and describes himself as a keen ornithologist and wildlife photographer. In a highly provocative maiden speech last month he claimed, without naming the newspaper, that by publishing leaks from the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the Guardian had handed a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\">gift to terrorists</a>&quot;. The claim has been questioned by MPs from all main parties and led a former director of public prosecutions, Lord Macdonald, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/14/snowden-leaks-mi5-chief-rhetoric-dpp\">accuse him</a> of using self-serving rhetoric.</p> <p>Parker has worked for MI5 for more than 30 years, including on Middle East terrorism, counter espionage, Northern Ireland terrorism, and serious and organised crime. He was also MI5&apos;s liaison officer in the US and deputy to the former head of MI5, Jonathan Evans.</p>  <h2><strong>Sir John Sawers - head of MI6</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4dd2ba29-219f-4f12-8a9c-1487ce5f26d7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/6/16/1245169815011/John-Sawers-the-new-head--001.jpg\" alt=\"John Sawers, the new head of MI6\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Sawers, the head of MI6.

By tradition, he signs his correspondence – copies of which go to the Queen – with the letter &quot;C&quot; in green ink. Although he had a spell with MI6 in Yemen, most of his career was in the Foreign Office and included the post of UK ambassador to the UN. He was Tony Blair&apos;s foreign affairs private secretary from 1999 to 2001 and had a brief spell in Baghdad after the 2003 invasion. MI6 has a staff of 3,200 deployed worldwide, and its biggest overseas station is Kabul.</p> <p>Sawers was brought in to lift the shadows over MI6 following the scandal of the misleading Iraq weapons dossier. He gave the first public speech by the head of MI6 and said he believed the mechanisms set up to hold the intelligence agencies to account were inadequate.</p> <p>But he was pushed on the defensive by the revelation that MI6 played a role in the abduction of Libyan dissidents to Tripoli where they were abused by Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s secret police, and by damning criticism of MI6 following the death of Gareth Williams, a GCHQ officer seconded to MI6 – an incident for which Sawers apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot;.</p> <p>He studied physics and philosophy at Nottingham University and lists his recreations as sport and the arts. He is due to retire next year.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527b5ea6e4b0ebad08ff9ceb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T09:45:54.597Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Nick Hopkins</strong> has drawn up a list of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/10-questions-intelligence-agency-chiefs\">10 key questions</a> the intelligence and security committee should ask the spy chiefs this afternoon. Here they are in full:</p> <p><strong>1. </strong>Stella Rimington, the former head of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/mi5\">MI5</a>, and David Omand, the former director of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq\">GCHQ</a>, have said it is time for Britain&apos;s intelligence agencies to be more transparent so the public can have greater confidence in their work. Do you agree, and how will you achieve this?</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>Former minister Chris Huhne said the existence of some of GCHQ&apos;s mass surveillance programmes were kept from the cabinet – and from members of the National Security Council. Why weren&apos;t ministers allowed to know about the programmes – particularly when they were relevant to discussions about data retention set out in the so-called snooper&apos;s charter?</p> <p><strong>3. </strong>Privacy campaigners, former cabinet ministers and even a former chair of the ISC, Lord King, have called in recent weeks for the laws that govern Britain&apos;s intelligence agencies to be overhauled. The agencies have argued against any changes. Why? What do the agencies have to fear from having more up-to-date laws?</p> <p><strong>4. </strong>Edward Snowden was one of 850,000 employees and contractors who had access to the secret material he leaked to the Guardian and others. Did the chiefs know that so many people outside the UK had access to British secrets? What has been done to reduce the numbers who can see this material?</p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Last year, 550 analysts (300 British, 250 American) were working on GCHQ&apos;s Tempora programme, which analyses calls, emails and Google search traffic coming in and out of the UK. How many are working on it now?</p> <p><strong>6. </strong>Documents seen by the Guardian describe how GCHQ regards the UK&apos;s legal regime as a &quot;unique selling point&quot; to be exploited when collaborating with the US. Why is Britain&apos;s legal framework deemed to be so attractive to the US?</p> <p><strong>7. </strong>The Washington Post revealed this week that GCHQ had &quot;hacked&quot; into Google&apos;s private fibre-optic cables in the UK as part of a joint programme with America&apos;s National Security Agency. Google said this was outrageous. Did GCHQ have legal authority to do this – and if so, which minister signed the relevant &quot;warrant&quot; – and when?</p> <p><strong>8. </strong>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\">NSA</a> eavesdropped on Angela Merkel&apos;s mobile phone for at least 10 years. Documents also show the NSA targeted the phones of another 35 government heads. Did Britain&apos;s intelligence agencies receive any transcripts of these conversations? Did GCHQ help the NSA tap any of these calls?</p> <p><strong>9. </strong>The agencies insist they seek legal approval for all their major programmes, and that if they want information from other agencies, such as the NSA, they need warrants for that material too.

These specific losses, however, are more than offset by massive gains. Public debates should recognize that we are truly in a golden age of surveillance.</p> </blockquote> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A simple test can help the reader decide between the “going dark” and “golden age of surveillance” hypotheses. Suppose the agencies had a choice of a 1990-era package or a 2011-era package. The first package would include the wiretap authorities as they existed pre-encryption, but would lack the new techniques for location tracking, confederate identification, access to multiple databases, and data mining. The second package would match current capabilities: some encryption-related obstacles, but increased use of wiretaps, as well as the capabilities for location tracking, confederate tracking and data mining. The second package is clearly superior - the new surveillance tools assist a vast range of investigations, whereas wiretaps apply only to a small subset of key investigations. The new tools are used far more frequently and provide granular data to assist investigators.</p> </blockquote> <p>Swire is now on Barack Obama&apos;s panel reviewing the powers of the NSA.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527b57dbe4b0ebad08ff9ce3\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T09:07:10.198Z\">9.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning.</p> <p>Today at 2pm the three heads of the UK intelligence agencies, Sir Iain Lobban of GCHQ, Andrew Parker of MI5, and Sir John Sawers of MI6, are going to give evidence before parliament’s<a href=\"http://isc.independent.gov.uk/\"> intelligence and security committee</a>.</p> <p>The hearing will be<a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Live.aspx\"> broadcast here</a> on a short time delay (in case anything is mentioned that might jeopardise national security), and I will live blog it.</p> <p>Also today David Miranda’s high court challenge to his nine-hour detention at Heathrow under the Terrorism Act last month continues, and is expected to conclude. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/david-miranda-heathrow-detention-glenn-greenwald\">Here</a> Owen Bowcott and Alan Travis report on day one of the hearing, in which lawyers for Miranda – the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald – told the high court his detention was unlawful and the first time journalistic material has been seized under a controversial provision of the Terrorism Act.

","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-07T10:30:00Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2013/nov/07/ghana-accra-technology-startup-robot","fields":{"body":"<p>In East Legon, a smart suburb of Ghana's capital, Accra, two men and a woman in their 20s stand in front of a slick ad featuring a large plane in mid-flight. They are pitching a business idea for a website that would allow travellers to compare ticket prices, then book and pay for airline tickets on domestic flights.</p><p>The pitch has sparked a lively debate among the pupils who sit in a darkened classroom, with the words \"generosity, positivity, standards\" emblazoned on the wall. The students, who nod seriously at the feedback, are on the first year of an intensive training programme at the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (Mest), a postgraduate school that offers university graduates – some with no prior experience at all – a two-year course in software programming and business development.</p><p>Mest provides its students with housing, pocket money, meals, transport and a laptop – free of cost – and, in return, it expects full concentration for two years of full-time study. Its teaching staff say that the transformation after students have been through the process is extreme. \"When they join, they probably haven't written two lines of code before. Next year they are creating apps left and right,\" says Unni Krishnan, senior faculty member at Mest.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that intensive training of this kind – which Mest says is producing world-class software engineers and businesses – is exactly what is needed in West Africa. But, like many of its neighbours, Ghana is still a country of contradictions, with pockets of world-class innovation coexisting alongside chronic poverty.</p><p>The mobile penetration rate in Ghana, which is now a lower-middle income country, exceeds 100%. Of a population of 24 million, 17 million people own a total of 27 million mobile phones. The six telecommunication companies operating in the country earn an <a href=\" http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive\" title=\"\">average daily income</a> of about $10m (£6.2m).</p><p>The Ghanaian company <a href=\"http://www.rlgghana.com/\" title=\"\">RLG</a> is increasingly popular in West Africa with its locally manufactured laptops, smartphones and tablets. Last month it added a Ghanaian tablet, <a href=\"http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=289637\" title=\"\">the \"G slab\"</a>, invented by a 28-year old as a rival to Apple's iPad and Samsung's Galaxy tablet.</p><p>Yet the Ghanaian education system still teaches through a Victorian English-inspired system of rote learning. In many schools, IT is taught in classrooms with no electricity, let alone access to computers, and pupils are asked to copy out pictures of a desk monitor and keyboard into their notebooks.</p><p>\"The Ghanaian education system is not generally producing people who are innovative,\" says Mac-Jordan Degadjor, a <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmacjordangh.com%2F&amp;ei=ZuZ4Uo2CHOeq0QWl-oHQCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZvmAp9ay2lr0S9cbmKkhko5TnrQ&amp;bvm=bv.55980276,d.d2k\" title=\"\">tech blogger</a> and entrepreneur who has raised the profile of tech startups in Ghana. \"We need to start focusing on entrepreneurial skills as a topic within schools, and make sure that by the time you get to university, you are not just thinking about applying for jobs, but starting something for yourself.\"</p><p>But, like those of many African countries, Ghana's tech entrepreneurs are thriving in spite of what is often perceived as a far from ideal environment.</p><p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1d2Iykk\" title=\"\">Mobile applications for money transfers</a>, bypassing the lack of access to formal banking for many rural dwellers, and for farmers who need <a href=\"http://www.esoko.com/about/news.php\" title=\"\">real-time updates</a> about prices and help accessing marketplaces, are examples of how developing country problems have only created opportunities for local entrepreneurs to come up with innovative problem-solving.</p><p>\"The exciting thing is that there's a new generation of technology entrepreneurs in Ghana who are starting to transform the country,\" says Dr Sipho Moyo, Africa director for <a href=\"http://www.one.org/us/\" title=\"\">anti-poverty charity One</a>, which is supporting tech innovation in Ghana. \"I have high hopes that their innovation can accelerate progress right across the continent, thus shaping its future.\"</p><p>\"Could the next Google come from Africa? Why not?\" says Richard Tanksley, entrepreneur and senior faculty member at <a href=\"http://www.meltwater.org/who-we-are/faculty\" title=\"\">Mest</a>. \"Our whole business model is to produce a globally successful software company in the next five years, and we have every reason to think it will happen.</p><p>\"There is so much focus on Africa as a place to invest, to build businesses, there is no reason why you couldn't have multimillion dollar software companies coming out of here.\"</p><h2><strong>Eyram Tawia, </strong>Leti Arts</h2><p>Walking into the office of <a href=\"http://www.letiarts.com/\" title=\"\">Leti Arts</a> is a bit like walking into a teenager's bedroom. Behind a closed door, on the ground floor of what is still a partly residential building, a room opens up, the walls plastered with giant comic figures of superheroes, dressed in bright Lycra with clenched fists and coloured lights emanating from their eyes.</p><p>But the half-dozen people sitting in this office are not playing games. They are working on a project they believe will revolutionise the way Africans relate to their folklore and history, by modernising ancient stories for a younger audience through games and comic strips on mobile phones.</p><p>\"We are not even good at preserving our history and folklore – we watch Thor, the Nordic god of thunder, or Superman, Spiderman, Captain America, Batman,\" says Eyram Tawia, 29, co-founder of Leti Arts.</p><p>\"But Africa has a lot of stories, voodoo and tradition that have been almost lost and can be brought back. Why not bring back a pharaoh from Egypt and turn him into a fantasy character? Why not bring back Yaa Asantewaa, the famous Ghanaian female warrior?\"</p><p>Yaa Asantewaa – who led Ghana's Ashanti people into battle, famously defeating the imperial British army – has until now only been accessible through oral history and dense academic tracts. But, reinvented, she looms large on the wall of the Leti Arts office, appearing as never seen before with a tiny waist, ample cleavage, six-pack and bulging biceps in the unmistakable guise of a female superheroine.</p><p>\"History in school is so boring,\" says Tawia. \"You have to read through 1,000 pages of textbook to learn about Yaa Asantewaa. You have to listen to about 15 cassettes to learn about Shaka Zulu. Modernising culture is very necessary to preserve the story for the new generation.\"</p><p>The Leti team designs games, which Tawia codes himself, and has produced \"Africa's Legends\" comic editions – described as an \"African Avengers\" – available on mobile devices through a free app, with some comics free and some paid-for.</p><p>The company is already generating its own revenue by building technology which it licenses to other companies, including a game for training health professionals on childbirth and a greeting card app made from a customised version of its server.</p><p>Leti Arts is already a viable business but Tawia says he hopes it will be much more than that. \"We are getting exceptional people to do really innovative things,\" he says. \"We are not just creating a company, we are building a whole new industry. Nobody has had job titles like 'lead illustrator' or 'game developer' in Ghana before. Now when I go to conferences, I meet lawyers, doctors, I say I'm a 'game developer' – it feels good.\"</p><h2><strong>Mac-Jordan Degadjor, </strong>tech blogger</h2><p>For tech people anywhere in Africa, this is a familiar sight. A dapper, 6ft 4in young Ghanaian, wearing Ray-Bans, a smart navy blue suit and brown beads around his wrist, sits engrossed in a laptop emblazoned with \"Make Fufu not War!\" and a sticker marked \"I do not consent to the search of this laptop\".</p><p>\"They tried to search it once!\" exclaims Mac-Jordan Degadjor, referring to when Dutch authorities insisted on gaining access to his laptop at Schipol airport. His beloved machine now bears the sticker as a form of protest.</p><p>Degadjor is no stranger to run-ins with the authorities. The 28-year old  first began his blog, <a href=\"http://macjordangh.com/\" title=\"\">macjordangh.com</a> – now renowned as one of the best tech blogs in Africa – as a young student in Ukraine, frustrated with persistent racism and unwanted attention from the authorities.</p><p>\"I started blogging because of the way the Ukraine police were targeting African students – harassing them and extorting money from them if they were not carrying their passport,\" he says. When he returned to Ghana, he realised that there was very little blogging going on back home, and what there was was not engaged with tech and innovation.</p><p>\"In Ghana we are still talking about political parties, about corruption,\" he says. \"We are behind other countries. Kenya has a goal to achieve broadband penetration of 100% by 2015.  We are still below 20%.\"</p><p>Degadjor's blog is now at the forefront of a change in Ghana. Despite the undoubted challenges in a country where basic infrastructure is still lacking – with erratic water and electricity supply even in major cities and poor roads – the Mac-Jordan Degadjor blog is a hub of startup tours, hackathons, tech ideas, and good news for those who care about Africa's place in a tech-driven world.</p><p>\"There are challenges, but the tech revolution is happening all over Africa,\" says Degadjor. \"Day in, day out people are getting together at hacker spaces or innovation centres, and gradually ideas are coming up from these hubs.\"</p><p>Now Degadjor is working on a project called AfroPreneus Web-series: How We Made It – a web series of 30-minute interviews with up-and-coming entrepreneurs across tech, fashion and social ventures, with a particular emphasis on featuring female-led businesses.</p><p>\"This is about celebrating African entrepreneurs,\" he says. \"So our target is to share these stories across the blogosphere, so that other young people coming up in Africa can know that when they finish school, they don't have to struggle to get a job, when there is so much unemployment – they can start their own company.\"</p><h2><strong>Nicole Amarteifio, </strong>social media strategist and online TV creator</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422073252'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/7/1383819303262/Nicole-Amarteifio-001.jpg' alt='Nicole Amarteifio' width='220' height='324' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nicole Amarteifio, creator of An African City: 'By putting my show online I have the creative freedom to talk about sexual politics.' Photograph: Nyani Quarmyne/Panos Pictures</figcaption></figure><p>In 2010, <a href=\"http://blogs.worldbank.org/team/nicole-amarteifio\" title=\"\">Nicole Amarteifio</a> was sitting in a class for her masters degree at Georgetown university in Washington DC, feeling upset. She was studying corporate communications, and a guest lecturer had come to discuss development.</p><p>\"This American woman did a presentation on development communications, and every African woman in it had a pot on her head and was half naked except for strings of beads\" says Amarteifio. \"I was very upset. Afterwards I told my professor; this is not the story of the African woman. It is only part of it.\"</p><p>For Amarteifio, whose Ghanaian parents raised her in London and the US from infancy, the sense that what was really happening in Africa was not being communicated was the catalyst she needed. After graduating, she went on to become a social media strategist on Africa at the World Bank.</p><p>\"Social media has really changed the discourse for young people in Africa,\" she says. \"The Africa region of the World Bank has been there – we had the first Facebook page, the first Twitter page – we are online, talking to young people on the continent, we are in their space. Africans are excited about it. Now you can tweet your president. The gap was so big before.\"</p><p>Using social media to involve Africans in a global discourse about their own future – which Amarteifio continues to do as a consultant – was part of her project to bridge the gap between the Africa she knows and the one the rest of the world sees.</p><p>But there was another side to life as an African woman Amarteifio felt was still not being communicated – life as a single, young woman living in the Ghanaian capital Accra – or what Amarteifio describes as a kind of African <em>Sex And the City</em>.</p><p>\"When I first saw <em>Sex And The City</em>, I just thought these women were so authentic – they are discovering their sexuality and talking in such an open way. But the gap between their experiences and my experience discovering the same things in Africa was so big.\"</p><p>In 2009, Amarteifio began writing her own series, <em>An African City</em>, set in Accra with characters from all over sub-Saharan Africa. But despite interest from TV channels, she is deliberately broadcasting the first series entirely online.</p><p>\"By going online, I don't have to be dictated by TV networks about what they do or don't want to see,\" she says. \"My show certainly pushes the boundaries – it is about five women who talk authentically about love and life, and that includes sensuality.</p><p>\"People will be shocked, and some people will be angry – especially some African men. But by putting my show online I have the creative freedom to talk about these sexual politics. It is all about the conversation.\"</p><h2><strong>Ben Nortey, </strong>robotics innovator</h2><p>Ben Nortey's sixth-floor office is one of the last places you would expect to find robots. Next to Makola market, the chaotic, pulsing centre of urban Accra, the Metro Institute of Innovation and Technology (Mint) is just one, neat room in a tower block which is surrounded by the commotion of traders, hawkers and shoppers on one side, the vast, misty Atlantic ocean to the other, and Accra's slow-trawling traffic all around.</p><p>But inside is a rare oasis of scientific order. Bookshelves lined with titles such as <em>Algorithms from P to NP</em> and <em>Programming Language: Concepts and Constructs</em> sit side-by-side with a neat array of robots – most made from scrap materials such as plastic bottles, colourfully painted, alongside electronics equipment, tools and robotics kits.</p><p>Nortey, an energetic 27-year old Ghanaian computer science graduate with an infectious smile, loves robots. \"As a child I had a lot of interest in these kinds of creatures – I loved movies like <em>Transformers</em>,\" he says.</p><p>Since there is virtually no robotics teaching in Ghana, Nortey taught himself. \"I worked out how to build robots by reading books, and by looking at what other people are doing on the internet and experimenting,\" he says. \"I spent hours on the internet – it has been a serious resource for me. And I have taken online courses on open platforms, like one from MIT and one from Stanford.\"</p><p>Nortey's vision is that in 20 years' time he will be building sophisticated robots in Ghana: \"In this part of the world, we start everything too late. In Ghana, many computer science students write their first computer program code during their first year in university. But I read stories of 12-year- olds in other countries who have built apps, put them in a store online and made loads of money. I want to transfer this knowledge.\"</p><p>Nortey's company runs <a href=\"http://themintoftech.net/\" title=\"\">private classes</a> for young people with a natural passion and interest in robotics, as well as other computer programming areas such as creating apps and gaming. One of his proudest achievements is teaching a five-year-old how to write code.</p><p>\"This five-year old learned how to program motors and micro-controllers.

Yvette Cooper blames Theresa May for relaxing the control order regime. (Tpims are watered-down control orders.) May blamed the law for steadily making control orders/Tpims weaker. Tory MPs blamed the burqa. But, on this at least, no one is blaming the Guardian. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/04/david-cameron-and-ed-balls-speak-at-the-cbi-conference-politics-live-blog#block-5277c296e4b01fc33230d61e\">3.53pm.) </a>Thank God for small mercies.</p> <p>Since 9/11 all governments have found it increasingly hard to know what to do about people suspected of terrorist activity who cannot be prosecuted (sometimes because intercept evidence cannot be used in court, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/25/leaked-memos-gchq-mass-surveillance-secret-snowden\">we recently learnt more about why that is so unpopular with the security services). </a>Labour only introduced control orders because its policy of locking suspects up in Belmarsh without trial and throwing away the key was ruled unlawful. May was moderately persuasive when she she said the courts were making executive action in this area harder, but Cooper successfully showed that Tpims were less effective than post-2007 control orders and May completely failed to answer Labour&apos;s charge that getting rid of relocation orders (the ones that subjected people on control orders to &quot;internal exile&quot; away from London) exacerbated the problem. Cooper had an open goal, and she whacked the ball into it very ably.</p> <p>What was interesting, though, was who did not get the blame. It was Lib Dem pressure (and David Davis) that forced the coalition to get rid of control orders and replace them with a more relaxed regime (plus heightened police surveillance, which clearly doesn&apos;t always work so well). But May did not highlight this at all. Was this coalition manners? Or is she more of a Davis-ite than we realised? I don&apos;t know.</p> <p>The other remarkable thing about the session was the level of burqa-bashing. By my count, three Conservative MPs called for legislation banning the wearing of burqas in public places. For a statement lasting barely 40 minutes, that&apos;s a lot.<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/09/19/ukip-veil-ban-policy-reversed_n_3954164.html\"> Even Ukip has now abandoned its call for a burqa ban.</a> But on the Conservative backbenches support for the idea seems to be growing. May, who, to her credit, firmly rejected the idea, probably finds this a bit alarming.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T17:47:21.265Z\">at 5.47pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5277c809e4b01fc33230d62a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T16:16:56.642Z\">4.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The statement is over.</p> <p>Unusually, John Bercow takes the opportunity to follow up Theresa May, who paid tribute to Jack Straw following the announcement that he is standing down at the election.

Here&apos;s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Security Service assesses that CC is linked to a group of six British nationals who received terrorist training from Al Qaida operatives, Saleh Nabhan and Harun Fazul in Somalia in 2006. It assesses that the group returned to the United Kingdom in late 2006 and early 2007 and has evolved into a well-established and prolific extremist facilitation network, actively supporting extremist associates in East Africa. The network consists of a UK-based group and an East Africa-based group. The UK-based group supports the activities of the associates in Somalia and also seeks to recruit and radicalise further individuals. The UK-based group maintains contact with the East Africa-based group to co-ordinate the transfer of money, equipment and individuals to Somalia.</p> <p>For the reasons set out in my closed judgment in this matter, I have come to the clear conclusion that the Secretary of State had and has reasonable grounds for suspecting or believing (respectively) that CC has been involved in terrorism-related activity. In particular, the evidence before the Secretary of State supports that conclusion in the following respects:</p> <p>(1) CC is closely linked to the network described above.</p> <p>(2) CC travelled to Somalia where he received terrorist training in 2008 from experienced Al-Shabaab operatives. CC attended a terrorist training camp in Kamsuma, Southern Somalia, from 2008 onwards in preparation for fighting along side Al-Shabaab.</p> <p>(3) CC fought on the front line in Somalia in support of Al-Shabaab.</p> <p>(4) CC facilitated the travel of several individuals from the United Kingdom to Somalia to enable them to take part in terrorism-related activity. He was involved in facilitating the attempted travel of Mohammed Aden (September 2008), Mustafa Ferole (June 2009) and the travel of Mohammed Sharif Nur to a training camp (August 2009).</p> <p>(5) CC facilitated the support of the UK-based network for terrorism-related activity in Somalia. The network, which includes Ibrahim Magag and Jama Hersi, has had access to money, false passports and documentation, as well as equipment. CC was involved in procuring funds for terrorism-related activity.</p> <p>(6) Between 2008 and late 2010 CC was engaged in procuring weapons for use in furthering his terrorism-related activity, including fighting and attack plans.</p> <p>(7) CC played a role in planning attacks in Somalia and overseas. CC was involved in an attack plan with Saeed Mohamed and Mohammed Ali Sharif Nur intended for the Juba Hotel in Mogadishu, Somalia in August 2010 and he was willing to participate in a terrorist attack.</p> <p>(8) Shortly before his arrest CC was involved in attack-planning with Hersi. These plans were potentially intended for western interests in Somaliland.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is a story about<a href=\"www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20947917\"> Ibrahim Magag, who absconded on Boxing Day 2012 when he was subject to a Tpim.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T15:33:23.000Z\">at 3.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5277b7a7e4b0ad7c52b606b6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T15:05:34.778Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2013/nov/04/david-cameron-hs2-cbi-conference-video\">Here&apos;s the Guardian video of David Cameron defending HS2 at the CBI conference.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5277b376e4b0ad7c52b606b4\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T14:51:11.926Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At 3.30pm we are going to get a Commons statement from Theresa May, the home secretary, about Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/04/missing-terror-suspect-theresa-may-statement\"> the terror suspect who was able to go missing on Friday after changing into a burqa at a mosque.</a></p> <p><strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, the shadow home secretary, has put out this statement about the case.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is extremely serious.

They were both quite eloquent about wanting more school pupils to be inspired by the prospect of a career in business, although, curiously, Balls was more passionate about this (see<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/04/david-cameron-and-ed-balls-speak-at-the-cbi-conference-politics-live-blog#block-52778a2de4b01fc33230d5fd\"> 11.52am</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/04/david-cameron-and-ed-balls-speak-at-the-cbi-conference-politics-live-blog#block-52778c11e4b01fc33230d601\">12.03pm)</a> than Cameron (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/04/david-cameron-and-ed-balls-speak-at-the-cbi-conference-politics-live-blog#block-527770d8e4b0ad7c52b60680\">10.04am). </a>More importantly, on Europe, they were both firmly in favour of Britain staying in a reformed EU, but also alert to the need not to take public support for the EU for granted. And on HS2 they were both in favour - provided the costs don&apos;t rise.</p> <p>So, is this the start of a harmonious new relationship? Of course not. It&apos;s more a case of politicians telling an audience what it wants to hear (or, to be more accurate, politicians doing their best to find common ground with the people they are addressing). But the nuances were interesting.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>• David Cameron has admitted that the government put too much emphasis on speed when it originally tried to win public support for the HS2 high-speed rail project.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/10424790/David-Cameron-HS2-was-wrongly-sold-to-a-sceptical-public.html\">As the Telegraph&apos;s Christopher Hope reports, </a>this is what Cameron said about this in the Q&amp;A.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the problems we have with HS2 is that the early argument - a lot of it was about speed.</p> <p>I make no apology for that – it is important to get from A to B quickly. Is there a businessman here who likes to take the slow train who likes to go more slowly – of course not. Everyone wants to get places quickly.</p> <p>But the real argument about HS2 isn’t speed it is capacity. The line is full – we need a new line and building HS2 will not just make it faster and more capacity to get from London to Birmingham, or London to Leeds or London to Manchester, it will have enormous knock-on benefits for other destinations.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is an argument that Lord Adonis, the Labour former transport secretary (and a strong supporter of HS2) made <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/08/it-would-be-act-national-self-mutilation-labour-cancel-hs2\">in an article in the summer. </a>Cameron also said that he wanted HS2 to come in <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/11/camerons-concession-labour-hs2-costs\">&quot;under budget&quot;</a> and, as trailed in advance, he said that Sir David Higgins, who is taking charge of the project, was being asked to cut costs. (See<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/04/david-cameron-and-ed-balls-speak-at-the-cbi-conference-politics-live-blog#block-52776a28e4b01fc33230d5d6\"> 9.38am.)</a></p> <p><strong>• Ed Balls has interpreted Cameron&apos;s comments as a vindication for Labour.</strong> &quot;I welcome the prime ministers&apos; belated recognition that he needs to get a grip [of HS2 costs]&quot;, Balls said, as he repeated his insistence that Labour will not give the project &quot;a blank cheque&quot;.</p> <p><strong>• David Cameron has backed <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/media/2451423/our_global_future.pdf\">a CBI report saying that Britain should stay in a reformed EU (pdf).</a> </strong>This was brave because, in Eurosceptic demonology, the CBI ranks alongside Peter Mandelson near the very top. (See, for example,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanHannanMEP/status/397309988785639424\"> this tweet.)</a> Cameron also wants Britain to stay in a reformed EU, but in the past he has not ruled out backing withdrawal from the EU if it refuses to cede back powers to the UK by 2017. However in today&apos;s report the CBI said that would be foolish.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No alternative option to full EU membership can combine all the benefits of EU membership with none of the costs; such solutions are simply unrealistic. While the UK could certainly survive outside the EU, none of the alternatives suggested offers a clear path to an improved balance of advantages and disadvantages or greater influence over the terms of UK interaction with its nearest neighbours. </p> </blockquote> <p>Today, in response from a questioner who wanted Cameron to make the case for EU membership, Cameron said: &quot;I think the CBI have hugely helped this morning with a very positive report.&quot;</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10424815/Public-support-for-EU-membership-is-wafer-thin-says-David-Cameron.html\">• But Cameron also said support of the EU was currently &quot;wafer thin&quot;. </a></strong>That was why he wanted reform, and then a referendum, he said. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But be in no doubt; in the end you cannot stay in these organisations that give up quite a bit of your national sovereignty unless you take the British people with you. The British people were told about a common market. They were told about an economic area. So much has changed about this organisation, and so little consent has been granted, that it&apos;s time to make those arguments, seek that consent, and as prime minister of this country that&apos;s exactly what I will do.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said he was convinced that the EU would reform. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I sit round that European Union table at these summits and I can see this organisation is going to change. It is changing in front of our eyes because of the euro. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• Balls has hinted that he favours a referendum on Britain&apos;s membership of the EU.</strong> At least, that is how I read this passage.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Europe needs reform, but to walk away from our EU membership would be reckless, foolish and deeply damaging. On Britain’s future in Europe, the national interest must come first. </p> <p>But at a time when most people in our country are seeing their living standards falling year on year, we cannot take public support for this open, global vision of a dynamic market economy for granted.</p> </blockquote> <p>UPDATE at 5.40pm: An aide to Balls has been in touch to say that he thinks I am wrong to interpret this as a hint that Balls favours an EU referendum. It was actually one of the most strongly pro-Europe speeches Balls has given, the aide said. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://speakers4schools.org/news-media/david-cameron-lauds-speakers-schools-cbi-2013-conference-challenging-uks-top-1000-ceos\">• Cameron has said that he wants 1,000 business leaders to sign up to the Speakers for Schools initiative launched by the BBC&apos;s Robert Peston.</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e0941130-6f80-40d8-85fb-bbdce1f814db\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/4/1383570952789/3c3d4feb-2b00-444a-9b39-6c0d22bba1c9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ed Balls speaking at the CBI conference.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Balls speaking at the CBI conference.

So let me address two. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, on airports, we welcome the Howard Davies review and it is Labour’s view that it should report before the General Election and not after. Under the Armitt plan, it would not have been possible to set up the Davies review without proper cross-party consultation, or kick the report into the next parliament. And if any future government then were to sit on the recommendations, the Armitt plan would give a clear remit to the independent commission to chivvy and chase.</p> <p>Second, on High Speed 2, the whole purpose of the Armitt plan is to ensure that in future the case for and the costs of any large project is properly and thoroughly and independently investigated. </p> <p>Labour supports HS2 and the idea of a new North-South rail link because of capacity constraints on the existing rail network. But our support for it is not at any cost.</p> <p>The Labour Party cannot – and will not - give the government a blank cheque. That is what you would expect from any credible official opposition seeing a Government desperately mismanaging a project. And that is what is happening here with the costs having shot up to £50 billion.</p> <p>Indeed, the costs have gone up by a staggering £10 billion in the last year, so I of course welcome the Prime Minister&apos;s belated recognition that he needs to get a grip. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527787e0e4b0ad7c52b60698\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-04T11:42:58.837Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Balls says there is no point businesses trying to undercut emerging economies.</p> <p>That is why Labour has asked Mike Wright, executive director at Jaguar Land Rover, to lead a review on strengthening manufacturing supply chains.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some of you will say government should just get out of way.

But from the outset, the event was marked by intensive political and commercial lobbying, particularly on behalf of the US. Ambassador David Gross, a lawyer and government co-ordinator for communications policy, led a well-funded and powerful campaign in the months leading up to the conference. Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Comcast and AT&amp;T were all on board, and the US press ran on-message examinations exploiting anti-UN feeling, concerns about Chinese or Russian control of the internet and warnings that certain proposed revisions were for the benefit of dinosaur telecoms firms.</p><p>After two weeks of complex negotiations, the treaty failed. The US saw the failure as a victory, claiming that the internet has never needed UN regulation and that the treaty was not consistent, in the words of US delegation head Terry Kramer, \"with the multistakeholder model of internet governance\". The US was joined by the UK and others, including most of Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, India and Kenya.</p><p>The US claimed that the treaty attempted to extend its telecoms remit to \"grab control of the internet\", which one critic said would see the internet develop conflicting standards and competing jurisdictions on a par with the European train system. Countries which unsuccessfully supported the revised International Telecommunications Regulations claimed the opposite; that the treaty enables standardisation, as it has done historically with dialling codes and consistent phone keyboards. They argued that the lobbying was more about protecting a western-dominated, US-centric internet administration.</p><p>In the wake of the revelations over the extent of international surveillance conducted by America's National Security Agency, the aggressive US strategy around internet governance seems to have had a different agenda. Richard Hill was one of the key players at the UN's International Telecommunication Union and co-ordinated the ITR conference, but has since retired. He told the Guardian that at the time, he had thought US pressure was based on defending its commercial interests.</p><p>\"Many countries are not comfortable with what they perceive as the dominant role of the US,\" he said. \"In Dubai, many people were wondering why the US was making so much fuss about such treaty provisions that were in fact inoffensive from a legal point of view.  Why were they expending so much political capital for so little?  At the time, many thought it was a question of principle. After the revelations concerning the NSA surveillance, it seems reasonable to infer that the US did not wish to agree to anything that might limit its surveillance programmes – and having to co-operate with other countries might have such an effect.\"</p><p>Hill said  some countries appeared to support key changes to the treaty, but then rejected them at the crucial final stage. Now with the Snowden revelations public, many countries are questioning the agenda of the US and argue that, because of its aggressive lobbying at the Dubai conference, the fallout has been exacerbated, says Hill.</p><p>Leading the charge against the US is Brazil, which voted for the revised treaty in Dubai. President Dilma Rousseff has accused the US of breaching international law, and announced plans for a national secure email service, an alternative internet infrastructure that will mean data cables are not routed through US soil, and updates to the <em>marco civil</em> legislative bill to tighten domestic cybersecurity. Rousseff also this month met with Fadi Chehadé –  a man the US had \"vetted\" to run Icann, the organisation which oversees internet addresses – and came out of the meeting having agreed to host a summit on internet governance in Rio in April 2014. \"The trust in the global internet has been punctured,\" Chehadé said after the meeting. \"Now it's time to restore this trust through leadership and institutions that can make that happen.\"</p><p>The accusation of internet imperialism is something the US fiercely defends, but it has its roots in the creation of the internet, and before it Arpanet, which was established between four US universities in 1969. The ethical and administrative bodies that oversee the internet are diverse and almost deliberately complicated, and present a forest of acronymed organisations including technical standards (IAB, <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/\" title=\"\">IETF</a> and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/\" title=\"\">W3C</a>) and regional domains (<a href=\"http://www.afrinic.net/\" title=\"\">AFRINIC</a>, LACNIC and APNIC).</p><p>Icann  is symbolically important and retains a link to the US government. The two have an \"affirmation of commitment\", but the US government's National Telecommunications and Information Administration has granted Icann the key Iana contract since 1999.</p><p>This contract involves managing the database that connects domain names, such as .com, .org and .co.uk, to their numeric address. There are only 13 authoritative root servers globally, but one principal at the centre which is then mirrored. This central root server is administered by Verisign, and is held at its base in Dulles, Virginia – one of the most symbolically important computers in the world.</p><p>Companies outside the US were not allowed to compete for the Iana contract, and having this central component controlled by the US government – with changes to top level domains passing through the US department of commerce – has long been been a point of contention.</p><p>The Iana contract is likely to be high on the agenda at the Rio internet governance summit next April. The outcome of this heated response to the Snowden revelations is unpredictable, says Hill. The average internet user will see little difference. But it is conceivable that Icann will further look to distance itself from the US, and could assert that a new server outside the US should become the authoritative root server. If the US resists, and two competing servers begin to compile increasingly different records of internet addresses, it could signify a true split in the global internet network. In the worst case scenario, some websites could become inaccessible to people in other parts of the world.</p><p>In reality, there are far too many commercial interests for that to happen. There is increasing pressure on the US government by its own technology companies to be more transparent about its surveillance and move to heal the rift in consumer confidence of companies such as Google and Facebook. Brazil is likely to push for plans to remodel Icann, which would include a more global, legal framework.</p><p>Milton Mueller, an internet policy professor,  helped to draft proposals for Icann transition in 2009, and though the model still stands, the ground has shifted for the US government.</p><p>\"There is no indication that official US policy toward hanging on to the Iana contract has changed,\" he said.</p><p>\"However, when the so-called multistakeholder internet organisations that the US purports to defend all unambiguously call for an end to that, the US position is de-legitimised.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/1/1383324817914/Dubai-skyline-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/01/nsa-furore-roots-us-internet-imperialism","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2013/nov/01/nsa-furore-roots-us-internet-imperialism","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Faking it: time to rethink intellectual property in developing countries?","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-29T12:25:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/oct/29/intellectual-property-rights-google","fields":{"body":"<p>In Kenya, where I live and work, the patent office, which is among the most active of patent offices on the African continent, has issued a total of 589 patents since the office opened in 1991. Compare that with the 5,500 patents issued by the US patent office in a single week in July this year.</p><p>An even scarier statistic is that, of the 50 or so patents granted in Kenya each year, between zero and five (on average) are granted to local Kenyan organisations or individuals. The remaining patents are granted to foreign firms, most of which are pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>The minimal number of issued patents is not due to a lack of innovation or entrepreneurship in Kenya. These are both present in abundance and the type of innovation that I've seen is typically of a kind that would be suitable for patent protection. Instead, the lack of patents is due to a lack of patent expertise in the private sector, and a lack of funds available to hire expensive patent drafting services from firms in Europe, South Africa, or India.</p><p>Without access to proper patent drafting, it is difficult for the Kenyan patent office to find applications that are suitable for granting as patents, and the ability of local inventors to obtain patents is severely diminished. Subsequently, without patents, the ability of local inventors to attract foreign investment and partnerships, and to build companies that are based on intellectual property (IP) assets, are also severely diminished.</p><p>In patent-laden countries such as the US, Japan and blocs like the EU, it is common for patent lawyers to have science and law degrees. Patent lawyers with similar qualifications are found only in South Africa, in Africa. Accordingly, the skills needed to protect innovations via well-drafted patents are scarce, almost non-existent.</p><p>One way to solve this problem is to train more people in Kenya and other countries in Africa in the skill of drafting and obtaining patents. I spend much of my time offering such skills-training but it is a long-term commitment (it can take a year or more) and with very little to show in the short term, there seems little incentive to acquire these skills.</p><p>It doesn't take long given the context before one starts asking some fundamental questions: is the western notion of patent rights the best system for Kenya? Could it be that a different system would do a better job of promoting innovation – which is ostensibly the raison d'être of the patent system? Is it reasonable to expect Kenyan entrepreneurs, businesses, and inventors to play in the same patent system with corporate giants such as Google, IBM, and Pfizer?</p><p>These are questions that not only apply to Kenya but also to much of the developing world. In a recent article <a href=\"http://www.aucegypt.edu/newsatauc/Pages/story.aspx?eid=1179&amp;goback=.gde_4517509_member_270832902#!\" title=\"\">Nagla Rizk</a>, a prominent Egyptian IP scholar in the area of copyright, argued: \"In developing countries poor people frequently find themselves in the dilemma of having to choose between the expensive original and the unlawful copy. It comes as no surprise that the less privileged would have stronger tendencies toward the illegal. Here, the need for novel business models that balance the needs of knowledge creators and users becomes evident, especially given the vast development of enabling technologies.\"</p><p>Most countries today (including Kenya) have so-called 'Trips-compliant' intellectual property laws. Trips – <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm7_e.htm\" title=\"\">Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights</a> – is a framework that applies to all World Trade Organisation member countries and compliance requires IP laws that largely resemble those of developed countries. So although there are minor variations from country to country, the IP laws of developing countries look (or will someday look) like those in the US or Europe. What this means is that there is very little opportunity for countries to tailor their IP laws to meet their individual needs, unless they wish to withdraw from the WTO.</p><p>It is often argued that the existence of IP laws incentivises innovation (as the monopolisation of knowledge or products create profits for those who own the IP rights) but considering the low number of patents in Kenya, the current high level of innovation cannot be attributed to incentives offered by the western-style patent regime that is in place.</p><p>Copycat businesses are a way of life here, and while they are fatal to some businesses, they are not always (or even usually) an insurmountable hurdle. Consider that <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\" title=\"\">M-Pesa</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/05/economist-explains-18\" title=\"\">most successful mobile money transfer system in the world</a> and hugely profitable, must compete with at least three other nearly identical systems.</p><p>Despite the benefits of WTO membership and of safeguarding one's intellectual property, the fact is that on balance, the western patent model is not yet helpful to most Kenyan – or African – entrepreneurs. The day may come when this is no longer the case, and in the meantime there is no doubt that more Africans should be exploiting the existing system. Still, the dream is for the day when foreign investment in African-owned patent assets will exceed foreign aid.</p><p><em>Isaac Rutenberg is director of the </em><a href=\"http://cipitlawstrath.wordpress.com/about/\" title=\"\"><em>Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law</em></a><em>, Strathmore Law School, Nairobi, Kenya.

So Diamond Bank set out to lower those barriers. </p><p>Working with Visa Inc and global nonprofit organization Women's World Banking, the bank created BETA, a pilot program aimed at signing up low-income locals – particularly women – for savings accounts. The bank sent out agents to collect deposits to make the process easy and to put a personal face on the institution. And it worked. </p><p>The program, which launched in April and is just wrapping up, was originally intended to enroll 16,000 people; it ended up creating 28,000 new accounts. More than 40% of the new account-holders were women. Now Diamond Bank is planning to roll out the program countrywide over the next six months.<br /> <br />\"The pilot results surprised us a little bit, positively,\" Anele said. \"We think it's very viable.\"</p><p>The Beta accounts are part of a growing number of efforts in developing countries to improve the financial status of the poor by encouraging saving. Attempts to connect low-income populations to formal financial products have been around for decades, but such efforts have traditionally focused on microcredit, the practice of making modest, targeted loans to help people – often women – start small businesses. </p><p>Over the past few years, however, a growing body of research and field experience has suggested that savings may be more effective than loan programs at helping those at the lowest income levels. </p><p>Conventional wisdom has generally held that these populations have too little money to save. Research, however, has concluded that even the poorest people do save, whether it's via investing in livestock, stockpiling grains, or simply collecting small sums of cash in a tin can. </p><h2>Savings key to financial inclusion</h2><p>Savings enable families to pay for school fees and medical costs, said Nisha Singh, a senior program director at the SEEP Network, an association of financial inclusion organizations. </p><p>\"If you are talking about moving people out of poverty in a way that can be sustainable, savings is a better place to start, because the focus is on creating or preserving assets,\" Singh said. </p><p>At the same time, mobile phone technology has become more powerful, more affordable and more widely available. This change means that banks can connect with potential customers in rural locations without the expense of building and staffing a branch location.</p><p>\"This is a great moment in history for technology to reach traditionally excluded populations,\" said Women's World Banking CEO Mary Ellen Iskenderian.</p><p>These shifts have created a surge in new initiatives that merge philanthropy and business, giving poor populations the benefits of formal banking and giving banks the benefit of a larger customer base. As women are far more likely than men to engage in saving, many of these efforts are aimed specifically at women.</p><h2>Are formal accounts the best approach?</h2><p>The advantages of formal accounts include protecting savers from theft or the temptation to spend compulsively. They also give people a foothold in the financial system, which can make it easier to get a loan or buy insurance in the future. </p><p>The jury is still out about whether formal accounts with private-sector banks are the best savings solution universally, however. At the lowest income levels, many people only are able to save perhaps 20 cents a day, Singh said. And even with technology reducing costs, banks to figure out how to make it financially viable to handle such small sums. </p><p>For Visa, involvement in this savings movement has provided an opportunity to advance its philanthropic mission of improving financial access for underserved populations. But the company is also candid about the potential business benefits of this work. </p><p>\"We're not apologetic when we talk about how our business interests really intersect with the public interest in trying to achieve those goals,\" said Stephen Kehoe, Visa's global head of financial inclusion. </p><p>\"If we can look at what makes it commercially viable, by its very nature we're going to be helping fulfill the promise of financial inclusion.\"</p><h2>Training Nigerian women as banking agents</h2><p>In addition to the Diamond Bank BETA program, Visa is expected to announce Monday that it is partnering with the London-based Cherie Blair Foundation for Women on a new venture to train 2,500 women to act as banking agents in Nigeria. </p><p>Working with an established bank, these agents will use a new Visa technology on mobile phones to offer branchless banking services to populations in remote and low-income areas. The program will provide employment for the new agents, as well as improving access to formal banking services. </p><p>\"It just makes sense to empower these women and make them financially independent and then let them make the choices that we in the developed world – some of us at least – can make already for ourselves,\" Cherie Blair said. </p><p>Visa is also working with CARE, a non-profit focused on helping poor communities, on a program in Ghana that helps people using informal methods of saving transition into formal bank accounts. The effort targets savings groups: small, local collectives whose members, most of whom are women, make small regular contributions to create a reserve of money they can borrow from as needed. </p><p>Care and Visa have partnered with local financial institution Fidelity Bank to reach these group members. Bank representatives visit the groups in their villages and use their phones to take pictures of members' account applications and photo identifications, explained Lauren Hendricks, executive director of Care's Access Africa program. The information is sent to the bank for processing and, within 10 minutes, applicants become verified accountholders, Hendricks said.</p><p>\"It's been really interesting to see really some of the poorest, most excluded people using some of the most sophisticated services offered on the planet right now,\" Hendricks said. </p><p>The eight-month-old program echoes a similar initiative Care has run in Kenya for about a year in partnership with Nairobi-based Equity Bank, telecommunications company Orange, and mobile money service M-PESA. Women's World Banking is also working on developing a savings product aimed at the unbanked with banks in Malawi and Tanzania. </p><p><em>Sarah Shemkus is a freelance reporter and editor who writes about business, technology, food and the places where they all meet</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/25/1353853631167/Nigeria-flag-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/visa-banks-fight-poverty-nigeria","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/visa-banks-fight-poverty-nigeria","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"NSA files – Merkel and Hollande call for talks with US by end of year – live","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-25T16:23:05Z","sectionId":"us-news","id":"world/2013/oct/21/nsa-files-live-coverage-developments-reaction","fields":{"body":"<div id=\"block-526e3ee2e4b0509529e1248e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-28T10:39:59.446Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/nsa-files-60m-spanish-phone-calls-monitored-as-merkel-row-continues-live-coverage\">This blog continues here</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-526a9a03e4b0ac030bfe38e2\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-25T17:23:05.035+01:00\">5.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A Conservative MP who claimed the Guardian had endangered national security with its reporting of top secret intelligence files has a picture on his official website of him posing with staff from the high-security US base in the UK, Menwith Hill, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/conservative-mp-julian-smith-national-security-nsa-leaks\">reports <strong>Matthew Taylor</strong></a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Julian Smith, the MP for Skipton and Ripon, raised concerns about the Guardian&apos;s coverage of the <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/us-national-security\">US National Security</a> Agency files, leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, in a House of Commons debate on Tuesday.

The House Intelligence Committee has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/04/congress-nsa-denied-access\">refused to provide either</a>. Supporters of the NSA&apos;s vast ubiquitous domestic spying operation assure the public that members of Congress can be briefed on these activities whenever they want. Senator <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/08/04/1228860/-Saxby-Chambliss-NSA-Spying-Uncovered-Current-Terrorist-Threats\">Saxby Chambliss</a> says all a member of Congress needs to do is ask for information, and he&apos;ll get it. Well I did ask, and the House Intelligence Committee said &quot;no&quot;, repeatedly. And virtually every other member not on the Intelligence Committee gets the same treatment ...</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\">Edward Snowden&apos;s revelations</a> demonstrate that the members of Congress, who are asked to authorize these programs, are not privy to the same information provided to junior analysts at the NSA, and even private contractors who sell services to foreign governments. The only time that these intelligence committees disclose classified information to us, your elected representatives, is when it serves the purposes of the &quot;intelligence community&quot;.</p> </blockquote> <p>He asks: &quot;why do Generals [Keith] Alexander [NSA director] and [James] Clapper [director of national intelligence] remain in office, when all the evidence points to them committing the felony of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order\">lying to Congress </a>and the American people?&quot;</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-25T15:54:07.643+01:00\">at 3.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-526a7100e4b01252577e9412\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-25T14:24:37.727+01:00\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/david-cameron-mobile-phone-us-spying-claims-nsa\"><strong>Rowena Mason </strong></a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/david-cameron-mobile-phone-us-spying-claims-nsa\">writes</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> is still using his mobile phone following revelations about US spying on foreign leaders, Downing Street has signalled.</p> <p>Asked whether the British prime minister was comfortable with using his phone after news that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\">NSA</a> had allegedly monitored calls made by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, his spokesman appeared to confirm Cameron was still using the same mobile &quot;Yes, I haven&apos;t seen him use a different one,&quot; he said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-526a6cd6e4b04921a1f0c392\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-25T14:06:39.204+01:00\">2.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Is he aware of any other EU country which is eavesdropping on British ministers?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Without setting it to music, you know, I’m not going to comment on intelligence and security matters. I’ve set out the framework in which the British intelligence services operate. I’m satisfied, as prime minister and the minister effectively for the intelligence services, I’m satisfied that’s a good framework. It’s a framework that works, and above all, you know, at a time when everyone is discussing this issue, let’s remember that the people who do this work, that keeps us safe, that helps to keep us safe, they are people we can never properly thank, we can never properly identify. We can’t have medal parades and ceremonies for the very brave things that they do and so it is worth saying every now and again on a public platform these are some of the most talented and bright and hard-working and dedicated officials in our country. They love our country. They work for our country, and we should thank them rather than try to make their job more difficult.</p> </blockquote> <p>That was the final question.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-526a6a58e4b01252577e9411\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-25T13:56:06.263+01:00\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Did he know GCHQ’s Tempora programme was operating in Italy and did he discuss that with Italian PM Enrico Letta?</em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There’s lots of discussions about these issues in the EU council as you could imagine. Let me say this, though, about what Mr Snowden has effectively done, and what some newspapers are assisting in doing, and that is going to make it a lot more difficult to keep our countries and our people safe.</p> <p>You know, we do have to take a sort of cold, hard look at this. As we stand today there are lots of people in the world who want to do us harm, who want to blow up our families, who want to maim people in our countries. That is the facts. It’s not a pleasant fact but it is true. We see it with what happened recently in Kenya, we see it with what happened to, you know, whether it was Italians or British people in In Amenas in Algeria, we’ve seen appalling attacks on British soil, we’ve seen appalling attacks throughout Europe.</p> <p>That is the threat that we face. And so we have a choice: do we maintain properly funded, properly governed intelligence and security services that can gather intelligence on these people using all the modern techniques to make sure that we can try to get ahead of them and stop them? Or do we stop doing that?</p> <p>And the point is what Snowden is doing, and to an extent what the newspapers are doing in helping him doing what he’s doing, is frankly signalling to people who mean to do us harm how to evade and avoid intelligence and surveillance and other techniques. That is not going to make our world safer. It is going to make our world more dangerous.</p> <p>And the first priority of a prime minister is to help try and keep your country safe, and that means not having some la di da, airy fairy view about what this all means, it’s understanding intelligence and security services do an important job.</p> <p>Yes, they need to be governed under law. Yes, they must be scrutinised by parliament, but we need those people; they’re brave people who help to keep us safe. And I’ve lost count of the plots that I’ve seen and the problems that I’ve seen being avoided by the work that they do. And that is really important, not just for Britain, but the information we gather, that we then share with other countries in Europe, has helped those countries in Europe too.</p> <p>So I make no apology for the fact that we have intelligence services, we will maintain intelligence services, and I will back the work they do, and I will criticise, though, those that, you know, make public some of the techniques they use because that is helping our enemies.

I think that is important. We all have secret intelligence services, as other countries do, but we don’t give a running commentary on what they do, we don’t comment on their work. That is very important.</p> <p>But let me make two points about the sort of framework for this. The first is I think the leaders of the European Union issued a good and sensible statement last night, about this matter, and I agree with that statement.</p> <p>And the second thing is specifically for Britain, but this applies to other countries as well, because remember this is a national responsibility, these intelligence agencies are a national responsibility, there’s no EU competence here, there&apos;s no EU drift here, and at the national level every national leader needs to be confident that their security services are properly overseen. Now in the United Kingdom we have proper parliamentary scrutiny through the intelligence and security committee, the ISC in parliament; we’ve strengthened that oversight. Everything that’s done is done within a framework of proper law. And wee also have intelligence commissioners to oversee the work of these agencies.</p> <p>So I’m satisfied that our intelligence agencies are properly governed, properly run, act under the law, and are subject to parliamentary scrutiny. And that is very important. </p> <p>But let me also say this: the work they do is very important. As prime minister I get to see that work at first hand. Every year for the last few years they have helped to obstruct, avoid and put off major terrorist attacks on our country. They help to keep our people safe.</p> <p>They actually help to keep people safe in other European countries too because we share so much intelligence and information with our EU partners. So they work they do is vital, they will always have my support, and they are properly scrutinised and run under the rule of law. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-526a62c9e4b04921a1f0c38c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-25T13:23:39.934+01:00\">1.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cameron says anonymous spies never get the thanks and “medal parades” they deserve and he wants to thank them now.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-526a6107e4b02571be0ad7fb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-25T13:16:29.104+01:00\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cameron is asked about whether GCHQ’s Tempora programme was operating in Italy.</p> <p>Cameron says Edward Snowden and the newspapers publishing his revelations are making it more difficult to keep our countries safe.

We will put all efforts into forging a joint understanding by the end of the year for the co-operation of the [intelligence] agencies between Germany and the US and France and the US, to create a framework for the co-operation … It&apos;s not just about me but about every German citizen.

But there has traditionally been a reluctance to make similar arrangements with other allies. Merkel said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are in Afghanistan together. Our soldiers experience life threatening situations. They sometimes die in the same battle. The friendship and partnership between the European member states, including Germany, and the United States is not a one-way street. We depend on it.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At least in Europe, we consider the right to privacy a fundamental right and it is a very serious matter. We cannot, let&apos;s say, pretend it is just something accessory. To speak about Chancellor Merkel, in Germany there was a part of Germany where there was a political police that was spying on people&apos;s lives every day [the East German Stasi]. So we know very recently what totalitarianism means. And we know very well what comes, what happens when the state uses powers that intrude in people&apos;s lives.

The French and German governments have demanded talks with the US by the end of the year as the row over the spying activities of the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security\"> US National Security</a> Agency intensifies. The move follows <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\">reports that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had her phone monitored by the NSA</a> and<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/us-french-surveillance-legitimate-questions\"> reports that the agency eavesdropped on calls made by members of the French administration</a>.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/nsa-spying-rift-us-europe-angela-merkel\">Sam Jones and James Ball write</a> the revelations are threatening to create a major rift between the US and its European allies.

The NSA does listen to the content of some of those phone calls. It also monitors the online and phone calls of foreign citizens.</p> <p>— Emails, instant messages and Facebook posts, as well as contact lists and raw internet traffic. Tech companies have denied giving the agency direct access to their servers, but the NSA paid them millions of dollars to cover the cost of complying with its requests.</p> </blockquote> <p>The final question was interesting too:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Why are people overseas angry?</strong></p> <p>There&apos;s no court that oversees the NSA&apos;s activities on foreign communications. The leaks have indicated that the agency not only spied on countries such as Iran, but also allies like France, Brazil, Mexico — and even UN diplomats.</p> <p>A key European parliament committee approved new rules this week strengthening online privacy and outlawing the kind of surveillance the U.S. has been conducting.</p> <p>Although foreign citizens may be angry, their governments&apos; responses have been more muted.

Mr Snowden has provided and the Guardian has published material that allegedly shows where and how the UK is functioning against terrorism.</p> <p>Is it anything other than criminal to seek to publish such secrets? In my view most right-thinking people would condemn Mr Snowden’s activities and question the actions of journalists whose newspapers may benefit from his wrongdoing.</p> <p>It is worth investigating whether there were any conspiracies to breach the Official Secrets Act. Of course, the Guardian is not subject to the Official Secrets Act but if the Guardian had conspired with anyone who is subject to the Official Secrets Act then they would be potentially guilty of an inchoate crime of conspiracy and indeed there may be other crimes that could be alleged.</p> <p>My understanding is that they are being investigated at the present time and it will be in due course for the CPS to decide, if the case is sent to the CPS, whether any crime can be brought before a court.</p> <p>Mr Miranda was carrying electronic equipment, apparently including an electronic games device that could have contained a mass of secret information in digital form.</p> <p>Its publication could have resulted in disastrous undermining of the legitimate efforts of secret investigations, perhaps putting back for years the struggle against worldwide political violence.</p> <p>How could David Cameron or Theresa May have vetoed a search that might have protected Londoners from another bus or tube bombing?</p> <p>Carlile, a Liberal Democrat peer, was independent reviewer of terrorism legislation from 2001 to 2011.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-677eca22-4363-4199-a28c-30bbdba74566\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/8/17/1313590729488/Lord-Carlile-anti-terror--007.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Carlile anti-terror adviser\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Carlisle.

Even Merkel seems to have lost faith in that promise by now. One doesn&apos;t dare imagine how Obama&apos;s secret services deal with enemy states, when we see how they treat their closest allies. Barack Obama is not a Nobel Peace Prize Winner, he is a troublemaker.”</p> <p><strong>Die Zeit</strong> writes that Obama&apos;s “half-hearted denial” of the allegations raised more new questions that it answered: “Was Merkel&apos;s mobile the target of NSA surveillance in the past?” The paper adds: “It is time for Obama and the US Congress to be ruthlessly transparent about the macabre practices of the NSA and restrain them strongly. They promised it months ago, but until recently very little has happened. With each revelation trust is eroded further. If America wants to stop annoying its friends and allies, it only has one option: get on the front foot and be open.”</p> <p>In the <strong>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</strong>, Georg Mascolo and Ben Scott warn of the creation of a “digital Maginot line” between Europe and the US, and instead call for a “no spy treaty” between European countries. “Storing data and surveillance would only be allowed for previously agreed goals – the fight against terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as grave acts of crime. All forms of political and economic espionage would be banned.

Merkel’s spokesman said that she had also voiced exasperation at the slowness of the Americans to respond to detailed questions on the NSA scandal since the Edward Snowden revelations<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\"> first appeared in the Guardian in June</a>.

As a “traitor,” he lacks the requisite intent and menace … The early denunciations of Snowden now seem both over the top and beside the point.

Didn’t members of Congress know all this stuff and hadn’t much of it leaked? Yes, that’s largely true. But my mouth is agape at the sheer size of these data-gathering programs — a cascade of news stories that leads me to conclude that this very column was known to the National Security Agency before it was known to my editors. I also wrote that “No one lied about the various programs” Snowden disclosed. But then we found out that James Clapper did. The director of national intelligence was asked at a Senate hearing in March if “<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/james-clappers-least-untruthful-statement-to-the-senate/2013/06/11/e50677a8-d2d8-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_blog.html\">the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is completely false</a>” and he replied that it was. Actually, it was his answer that was “completely false.”</p> </blockquote> <p>And he now believes Snowden was a whistleblower:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am sure that police powers granted the government will be abused over time and that Snowden is an authentic whistleblower, appalled at what he saw on his computer screen and wishing, like Longfellow’s Paul Revere, to tell “every Middlesex village and farm” what our intelligence agencies were doing.

If journalism – receiving, and reporting on, leaks, were all that the Guardian did, parliament and MI5 would not now be involved.”</p> <p>What concerns him is his claim that “the editors of the Guardian [stepped] beyond any reasonable definition of journalism into allegedly copying, trafficking and distributing files on GCHQ – information which would not only endanger Britain’s national security, but also may identify personnel currently working in our intelligence services, risking their lives and those of their families – to American papers and bloggers, and around the world.”</p> <p>Smith claims he is not arguing that the press should be muzzled, says he supports a re-examination of intelligence gathering and oversight of the security services, and acknowledges that Edward Snowden – for his NSA revelations at least – can be considered a whistleblower.</p> <p>But he claims this term does not apply to the Guardian’s stories about GCHQ:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Guardian has done no whistleblowing on GCHQ, and exposed no illegality. Story after story in their paper has been forced to concede they have found no evidence whatsoever that our intelligence forces have broken British law.

A basis for this solution would be a &apos;national routing&apos; just like in the US.

It alerted me to the fact that even in this great country of ours with this fantastic Constitution, there’s a real pressure against press freedoms that’s going on. Perhaps unintentionally in the hot pursuit of leakers and trying to protect secrets, we are really putting pressure on press freedom here.

The problem for farmers is access: only around 6% of cultivated land is equipped for irrigation, leaving millions dependent on rain-fed agriculture. How might more of them be helped to access water that could raise their productivity?</p><p>Large-scale, government-funded irrigation systems have long attempted to address this, with varying degrees of success. Those systems have a place, but research by the <a href=\"http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org\" title=\"\">International Water Management Institute</a> (IWMI) has found that many smallholders are themselves taking the lead and investing in their own low-cost, small-scale irrigation systems.</p><p>Surveys carried out by IWMI as part of its <a href=\"http://awm-solutions.iwmi.org\" title=\"\">AgWater Solutions project</a> revealed a growing trend for individual and community-owned agricultural water management systems. In Ghana, for instance, small private irrigation schemes were found to cover 25 times more land than public irrigation schemes.</p><p>\"Small-scale agricultural water management dominates the landscape in south Asia but it's really becoming quite a feature also in sub-Saharan Africa now,\" says Meredith Giordano, principal researcher at IWMI.</p><p>\"When we looked and added up the numbers it was much more than was recognised. So this is happening in Africa, and it's important to recognise that, because it hasn't been widely documented.\"</p><p>The findings of the AgWater Solutions project – carried out with partners including <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/home/en/\" title=\"\">FAO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sei-international.org/\" title=\"\">Stockholm Environment Institute</a>, and funded by the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> – suggest that supporting smallholder irrigation could have a significant impact on productivity and incomes.</p><p>In Zambia, for example, it found that smallholders who were able to cultivate vegetables in the dry season earned 35% more than those who do not. The systems used for small-scale irrigation, such as pumps and on-farm ponds, are relatively cheap, and being freed from rain dependence can allow farmers to grow crops year-round, and to grow more high-value crops.</p><p>Research from the <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org\" title=\"\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> (IFPRI) also backs this up: its <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/publication/what-irrigation-potential-africa\" title=\"\">report</a> into the irrigation potential of Africa calculated much greater returns from investing in small-scale agriculture than in large-scale, dam-based systems. The internal rate of return (IRR) for large irrigation projects was found to be 7%, but 28% for small-scale irrigation because there is still so much unirrigated arable land located away from any large irrigation infrastructure.</p><p>\"With small-scale irrigation the initial cost is lower,\" explains Liangzhi You, senior scientist at IFPRI and co-author of the report.</p><p>\"And if you can grow one more crop in the dry season, that can mean you can then make a profit. A lot of government agencies and even donor communities like big projects, but if you look at the returns, small-scale actually gives higher returns, and from my own research I think small scale irrigation is the future in the African context.\"</p><p>The treadle pump is one of the low-cost technologies used by farmers to irrigate land. A human-powered pump, it requires users to step up and down on treadles which drive pistons, drawing groundwater up to the surface.</p><p>The spread of the treadle pump, which costs around $20 to $100, has been driven by the NGO <a href=\"http://www.ideorg.org\" title=\"\">iDE</a>  which first began to promote the technology in Bangladesh in the 1980s. The pumps have been introduced into sub-Saharan Africa too in more recent years, with iDE supporting the development of supply chains through its programmes in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, and Zambia.</p><p>The challenge in sub-Saharan Africa is that farmer-driven investment in small-scale irrigation is spreading without much governmental support in creating an enabling environment where farmers have information on the various systems, financial services to help them invest, and market access to sell produce.</p><p>\"It's important that we recognise that this particular kind of private smallholder investment falls through institutional cracks,\" says Giordano. \"A lot of it is happening organically, and we need to identify opportunities to help support that, so that farmers will have better information.\"</p><p>Motorised pumps, for example, are also becoming popular but are usually imported, which can make them expensive and present practical challenges if the instructions come in languages not understood by users, or if spare parts are difficult to find. Simply providing translated instructions is one way of providing support.</p><p>Another constraint is the lack of detailed hydro-geological mapping for Africa as a whole. Treadle pumps can only reach a certain depth – around 7 metres, depending on the type of pump – so won't be useful if water resources are deeper. Successful rainwater harvesting in on-farm ponds can depend on soil type and rainfall patterns, and works best on moderately sloping land.</p><p>\"It's critical to know where the water is, and recharge rates and depths, to plan these kinds of systems,\" says Jennifer Burney, an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego and co-author of a <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/07/17/1203597110.abstract.html?etoc\" title=\"\">recent study</a> on the benefits of local irrigation systems in developing countries.</p><p>\"Finding a way to do mapping with some economies of scale and making the information public or available to smallholders would change the landscape and economics entirely.\"</p><p>Finance is also a key constraint: a motorised pump of $250 may be relatively 'low cost' but is still unaffordable to many farmers. Microfinance services are either unavailable in rural areas or have been unwilling to provide agricultural loans, though some are now more supportive.</p><p>\"There is some change there,\" says Burney. \"For example, the direct lending site <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org/\">Kiva</a> is starting to look into new loans of this scale for farmer groups. Capital is the number one constraint for adoption, so this is urgent in so much as it will unblock the system.\"</p><p>The need for upfront investment has in fact led to a rental market emerging in sub-Saharan Africa, where entrepreneurs either rent out pumps to farmers by the day or season, or even provide an irrigation service themselves. Monitoring developments such as this provides points of entry for donors and NGOs to help create an enabling environment in ways other than simply providing pumps.</p><p>\"The important point is that this is something that farmers are already doing themselves,\" says Giordano. \"They're investing their own money in these opportunities, but within that there are still constraints that they face, so it's about how to expand that potential and help them reduce risks.\"</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The event gathers Omidyar Network's Africa-based and Africa-focused partner organisations to share insights around innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership.</p><p>Amy Klement spoke to us about the role of human capital in advancing entrepreneurship and how technology can be used to address pressing social issues, like improving the standards of education in developing countries.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about your role at Omidyar Network?</strong></p><p>I'm a partner at Omidyar Network based in California and my team is responsible for much of our work in emerging markets. I lead our work across financial inclusion, education, property rights, entrepreneurship and consumer internet and mobile. My team works in a lot of places where we don't yet have a team. For example, my team did a lot of the initial investments in India and Africa which influenced our decision to open offices in these territories.</p><p><strong>One of the themes of the ON Baraza is human capital. What does human capital mean for the Omidyar Network?</strong></p><p>Human capital is a core element of our model. It sprung from Pierre Omidyar's experience at eBay with the service providing a platform for entrepreneurism. It's this idea of investing in people and we do this in three ways - strategy, governance and leadership. So the strategy work really starts with our diligence of the company as we explore the company's strategy. We do a deep dive into their plans to understand their long-term vision and to help in coaching them along the way. We often hear from our investees that our diligence process helps improve their organisation - even before they receive funding. The second prong is governance. For the majority of companies that we invest in, we take on a governance role by sitting on their board. The third prong is around leadership as we really invest in the leaders of our investee organisations.</p><p><strong>What have been some of the challenges of moving into emerging markets and how did you overcome them?</strong></p><p>One of the things we have learnt is that it is difficult to invest from afar without a local team. Making strong investments and then supporting those entrepreneurs from the other side of the world is challenging. Another learning, which relates back to our human capital, is that the challenges faced by an entrepreneur living in Kenya serving the base of the pyramid are very similar to the challenges faced by an entrepreneur living in Silicon Valley, building a product for iPhone users. A lot of these challenges - around growing an organisation, how to scale leadership - are similar across all our investees, and that's part of the reason we have developed a curriculum around human capital.</p><p><strong>What is the role of the Omidyar Network in advancing entrepreneurship in Africa?</strong></p><p>It is a key focus for us. One of our initiatives is around entrepreneurship and our goal is to help build a vibrant ecosystem for entrepreneurs. Key ingredients within this ecosystem include human and financial capital, a regulatory framework and adequate infrastructure. You need policy and a regulatory frameworks that enables experimentation and quick wins. You need a human capital ecosystem that encourages mentorship because what people need more than anything are coaches and people that have done it before.</p><p><strong>ON Baraza brings together investees focused on the African projects. What does belonging to the network mean for investees?</strong></p><p>It means having access to the other Omidyar investees and organisations that we work with. It means peer learning and having access to events like the ON Baraza where we invest in leadership. We really want to invest in the entrepreneur, and the CEO's themselves recognise that their journey is really critical to the success of their organisation. We hope that over time in the sectors that we work in, for example education, that belonging to the network means bringing together a cross sectoral group of leaders who have a shared view of how to change education and how they can work together collaboratively to make that happen.</p><p><strong>From the investees at ON Baraza, are they any you can pick out that you are really excited about?</strong></p><p>One that I'm particularly excited about is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bridgeinternationalacademies.com/\" title=\"\">Bridge International Academies</a>. This is an extremely exciting model that I believe is going to transform education. It's a highly scalable model and they have figured out how to expand the model very quickly, without franchising. They are offering a very affordable education service, less than $5 a month, and they are seeing results that are equal to or better than government schools. In the past few months they have opened up 77 new schools and they have over 200 schools in total.</p><p>One of the things that is particularly exciting about it is that one of the founder's backgrounds, Jay Kimmelman, is in software. He's a serial entrepreneur and has previously founded, Edusoft. One wouldn't think that schools in the slums of Nairobi would be a tech company, but in so many ways they are. Their curriculum sits in the cloud, all of their payments are handled digitally. It is a highly innovative model that we hope can be replicated across the world.</p><p><strong>Do you think that technology has a limitless potential in addressing social problems?</strong></p><p>We do. Technology is our roots. We are here because of a technology platform - eBay. And when we look at the importance of connection, access and ownership, technology is able to accelerate all of that in a non-linear fashion. So because we look for scale, for solutions that touch hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives, that usually involves some component of technology.</p><p><strong>Finally, what is next for the Omidyar Network?</strong></p><p>Continuing to find fabulous entrepreneurs and to support and grow them on a global scale. We are still in the early stages ourselves. We have a meaningful presence in India, we are growing in Africa and hoping to continue to expand globally, replicating the innovation we see around the world so that a company like Bridge International Academies can be a global solution and intervention for education around the world.</p><p><em>Amy Klement is a partner at Omidyar Network</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/21/1382371532316/Amy-Klement-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2013/oct/22/entrepreneurship-amy-klement-omidyar-network","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media-network/2013/oct/22/entrepreneurship-amy-klement-omidyar-network","sectionName":"Media Network"},{"webTitle":"Future development goals: 'the tough work is about to begin'  ","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T10:44:04Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2013/oct/21/united-nations-sustainable-development-goals","fields":{"body":"<p>Few would envy Macharia Kamau, the Kenyan representative to the UN in New York.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As co-chair of the <a href=\"http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1549\" title=\"\">open working group</a> on sustainable development goals (SDGs), a relatively low-profile UN initiative set up after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/global-development+environment/rio-20-earth-summit\" title=\"\">Rio+20 conference</a> in Brazil last year, Kamau has a  big brief: the design of a new set of ambitious, global goals that will apply to all countries and help orient international attention – and resources – towards tackling some of the world's most pressing problems.</p><p></p><p>To do this, he and Csaba Kõrösi, his Hungarian counterpart, will have to bring together governments who disagree on issues such as women's rights, diplomatically fend off demands from NGOs and campaign groups insistent that their issue takes priority, and grapple with country blocs and bureaucratic, inter-governmental processes.</p><p></p><p>So far, Kamau says, discussions have stayed close to poverty, hunger, water and other topics covered by the millennium development goals (MDGs) – the UN's flagship development campaign set in 2000 and structured around eight goals to be met by 2015. From November, however, Kamau says debates will have to move on to trickier territory.</p><p></p><p>\"The tough work is about to begin. People will have to face up to that,\" he says. Issues on the table range from trade and debt, through to human rights and conflict, to biodiversity, oceans and forests. \"I mean, the WTO has been stuck on trade for years, and here we are wading into that, but we have no choice.\"</p><p></p><p>Unlike the MDGs, which Kamau describes as a \"top-down arrangement\" focused on developing countries, this new set of goals will apply to rich and poor countries and has to be built on progressive, negotiated agreements by UN member states, he says.</p><p></p><p>\"There is a growing realisation that we are all in the same boat. On some of these issues – biodiversity, climate, environment – there is no getting away from the fact that everyone has to contribute,\" says Kamau, though he concedes that rich countries did initially seem a bit surprised, and a little sceptical about goals applying to them as well. There remains \"a bit of a wait and see approach\" from some governments, he adds.</p><p></p><p>Between now and March, the working group is looking for broad consensus on what the main issues are and how they affect all countries, says Kamau. The group will then get into detail on specific goals, and by September 2014 should have a set of proposals ready to unveil at the UN general assembly.</p><p></p><p>Despite its huge brief, the working group is relatively unknown – particularly in comparison to UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon's high-level panel on post-2015 development, co-chaired by  David Cameron. Kamau said the <a href=\"http://www.post2015hlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/UN-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">panel's report</a>, presented to the UN in New York last month, proved it was possible to grapple with such difficult global issues in fewer than 3,000 pages (it came to 81), but was ultimately limited by the fact that it was driven by the interests of the panel's three co-chairs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>\"The high-level panel was a celebrity-type arrangement, let's confess to that,\" says Kamau. \"We're a much more regular intergovernmental process. And at the end of the day, everybody knows that it's an intergovernmental process that will drive the whole effort forward. Why? Because everything that is global is built on consensus, and consensus requires that you try to get as many member states, as many constituencies, on board as you possibly can.\"</p><p></p><p>This is easier said than done, Kamau admits. \"The Middle East, being oil-rich, energy-rich, cash-rich, they see challenges radically differently than least developed countries,\" he says, while rich industrialised countries face their own challenges. Asian countries are \"on a different trajectory and feel extremely optimistic about the future, though recognise that the technology that they continue to base their transformation on … is doing infinite damage to the environment, to climate, to biodiversity\".</p><p></p><p>In particular, Kamau says he worries about \"unholy alliances\" such as those between energy-producers in rich and poor countries that may see the SDG process as a threat.</p><p></p><p>The working group is expected to come up with between eight and 12 high-level goals, but Kamau insists people should not see this as a list of possible activities for aid budgets to fund.</p><p></p><p>While some of the world's poorest countries will need extra help, and aid will have to play a part in that, Kamau says the SDGs will be written with an understanding that all states have to take collective responsibility for challenges faced. \"This has been the big shift that has happened since the latter part of the last century and this century.\"</p><p></p><p>One challenge, says Kamau, is to ensure that various goals, targets and indicators proposed do not contradict each other. \"We have to make sure that there is consistency between what we're doing on one aspect, say macroeconomic policy, with what we're aspiring to in another aspect, say climate change, or consumption,\" he says. \"The sum of all these pieces must make a coherent whole that is consistent with our aspirations for sustainable development.\"</p><p></p><p>If the SDG process can seem laboriously technical, Kamau is quick to stress the big picture: only a small proportion of the world are living lives \"consistent with peoples' expectations of the 21st century – in terms of food, clothing, shelter, medical access, education and so on … the bulk of the world's population is still aspiring to these heights of consumption, to these heights of education – and rightly so\". The fundamental question is how to raise living standards while keeping the global burden on food systems, biodiversity, and natural resources in check, he says.</p><p></p><p>Is all of this work – to build consensus, broach deep divides between countries on issues such as women's rights, manage expectations and find ways to measure and track progress towards new global goals – worth it?</p><p></p><p>Yes, says Kamau, pointing to the MDGs as proof that goals keep policymakers focused and help shift debates from what priorities should be on to how to push forward progress. \"For Kenya, and many other African countries, the MDGs were in many ways palliative, they were not radical, transformative goals,\" he adds. \"But there is nothing wrong with fixing disease and ignorance and hunger. These are fundamentals ... the MDGs helped remind everybody and focus resources both external and internal on the fundamentals – you have to get these things right.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/10/18/1382093069514/MDG--Macharia-Kamau--Conv-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/oct/21/united-nations-sustainable-development-goals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/oct/21/united-nations-sustainable-development-goals","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"US development digest: Friday 18 October","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-19T02:35:44Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/oct/14/globaldevus-live","fields":{"body":"<div id=\"block-52619100e4b0760efba2af91\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-19T03:34:30.721+01:00\">3.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Thank you and goodnight</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We&apos;ve had some great content and comments this week as we focused on all things US global development.

Here&apos;s how:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.fii.org/\">Family Independence Initiative</a> was pioneered in inner-city Oakland, California by Maurice Lim Miller, who won a MacArthur Genius grant for his innovative approach to working with urban poor people in the US. The approach is to gather self-selected groups of people into supportive solidarity groups, where each person is asked to articulate a goal for themselves in front of the group that would help improve the welfare of his or her family. Such goals could include a clean drug test, a job interview, saving a given sum of money to invest in a small business or buy a home, or improved school grades for children. The group meets regularly to support each member in reaching his or her goal. A major part of the programme is believed to be the strong support that families receive from other families in helping to make small positive decisions, whose cumulative effect will be to lift the household out of poverty. When group members achieve their goals, they receive a small prize. The prize is often a small cash grant or a gift related to the goal like a necktie to wear to a job interview or a school backpack.</p> <p>FII reports considerable success with this approach; family income increased an average of 25% over the two-year participation period, savings increased, and children of participants did better in school. At the University of San Francisco, professor Alessandra Cassar and I have run experiments recently to test the relative impact of different aspects of this model in three different countries. We try to ascertain whether it is the goal setting itself that yields the biggest results, the group support, or the prize. We have conducted these experiments overseas with young mothers in Indonesia, microfinance borrowers in Colombia, and disabled men receiving wheelchairs in Ethiopia, running a ranomised control trial to test what aspects of the programme are most important. Our results are only preliminary at this point, but seem to indicate that while the group effect and prize effects can be important, the simple articulation of a goal is a very powerful way to help people escape poverty traps. The implications for development practitioners are profound: while in the past we have focused on external interventions to relieve poverty such as providing schools, doctors, and microfinance, it may be that harnessing the internal aspirations of poor people is equally if not more important.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5261518ce4b0010b6627a9f0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-18T16:57:06.734+01:00\">4.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Content update: &quot;The US is perilously behind in the movement for corporate transparency&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Anna Scott writes</em></p> <p>In our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/oct/18/us-tax-evasion-money-laundering\">latest blog</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gfintegrity.org/\">Global Financial Integrity</a> president Raymond Baker exposes a complacency in the US government&apos;s approach to addressing tax and illicit finance.</p> <p>Despite the $1tn in illicit financial flows from developing countries each year, the US Congress and administration have been &quot;more interested in recouping some of the [money] missing from the US Treasury each year due to offshore tax haven abuses&quot;, according to Baker.

There&apos;s been much to learn this week; from how activists are using geotagging and mapping technologies to hold governments to account for human rights abuses, to how researchers are following illicit financial flows to combat human trafficking.</p> <p>But mostly it&apos;s been about a cultural exchange of sorts - understanding how the unique institutional structures and cultural norms in the US help or hinder the work of advocates. Campaigning for environmental, social or economic justice in a context where the majority of the population don&apos;t have passports, the mainstream media is for the most part disinterested in development, and the dominant rhetoric is that American interests supersede and are somehow distinct from the rest of the world, can be tough.</p> <p>In DC particularly, where professionals work close to the seat of power, there is plenty of speculation about what reforms - from USAid to the World Bank - will mean. For the most part though, that reform is welcomed. And following the news that the Gates Foundation has signed up to the IATI, there is now hope that other philanthropic organisations, who are not compelled by law to report how they send their money, might follow in the foundation&apos;s footsteps.</p> <p>So though the series ends tomorrow, 18 October, it is even clearer to us that there is value in having a space where development actors and humanitarians can read and create content intended to share knowledge and challenge assumptions about how development should be done and who it should be done by.

But it is shocking how little information the US government actually releases about where US aid dollars are going and what the results are. More transparency will enable advocates to hold their governments accountable for how they invest US resources. To do so, they tell Oxfam they need more information about how much, when, and for what US aid is coming into their country.</p> <p>At the end of last week in DC, Oxfam America hosted four African government and civil society leaders (pictured above) who spoke in congressional and USAid offices and to stakeholders at the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2013/10/open-government-transparency-ingram\">Brookings Institute</a>, as well as the <a href=\"http://www.modernizeaid.net/\">Modernising Foreign Assistance Network</a> about how local actors can and are using aid data to strengthen country systems and empower citizens.</p> <p>On the surface, the US shares plenty and this summer, USAid, Millennium Corporation Challenge and US departments of treasury and defence released unprecedented amounts of foreign aid data to the <a href=\"http://foreignassistance.gov/\">Foreign Assistance Dashboard</a>. The publication of the <a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/index/\">aid transparency index</a> on 24 October will tell us if US agencies providing development aid have improved practices over the past year.

Its bilateral programmes struggle with bureaucratic and political constraints that have accumulated over many decades... These constraints become even more debilitating in countries where the US has high-stakes security and diplomatic interests, as it does in Pakistan or Afghanistan, that further handicap the management of its bilateral aid programmes.</p> </blockquote> <p>Along with an assessment of the challenges, Birdsall and Sowa put forward a solution.

First off, savvy NGOs are pursuing new funding strategies that do not rely heavily on the fickle whim of grants and government appropriations. Of course the mantra hums to the beat of &apos;being a sustainable organisation&apos; but behind that semantic lies an urgency to create self-generating income streams.</p> <p>Second, corporations are responding to a rising expectation – from both customers and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/oct/15/child-labour-supply-chain-australia\">their own employees</a> – to be more intentional around their manufacturing and their supply chains. &apos;Transparency&apos; and &apos;responsibility&apos; are the buzzwords in the business sector at the moment, and those dynamics are causing a re-imagination of the means of production.</p> <p>Finally, development banks and governmental aid agencies have tired of expensive projects that yield meager results. They aim to invest more strategically, where infrastructure can connect seamlessly to a viable commercial market. The net effect of these patterns gives rise to an emerging model, the vertical integration of development - where previously separate processes are now being performed by the same organisation.</p> <p>Here&apos;s an example: chocolate companies are looking five years ahead and realize that there will be a scarcity of cocoa in general, and, even more so, insufficient supply of &apos;ethical&apos; or &apos;fair trade&apos; cocoa. So a few business-fluent NGOs have negotiated with chocolate companies investments for growing and processing cocoa in regions outside of east Africa. Once those commercial agreements are in place, development banks and governmental aid agencies are investing in those same NGOs to nurture the technical capacity and scaling infrastructure that will increase the likely success of cocoa production in new regions. This integration enables each of the actors to achieve their distinctive goals, and aligns their financial incentives.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>David Batstone is president of <a href=\"http://www.notforsalecampaign.org/\">Not for Sale</a>, an anti-trafficking organisation based in San Francisco. </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f4de1e61-3e88-4732-85d8-f5f64ea21000\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382042091418/653cd9ea-c806-4c4d-b9fd-e032cbd452a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cocoa beans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fermented cocoa beans being turned over while being dried in Ghana West Africa.

However he readily acknowledges gaps remain and that the report should be considered as a foundation for future research, rather than a definitive picture of the problem. Nick Grono, CEO of Walkfree also acknowledges that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/oct/17/29-million-people-enslaved-global-index\">&quot;the data is not that strong&quot;. </a></p> <p>We want to hear what you make of the index.

The lack of it drags down all development efforts. Imagine this — the amount of electricity used by the Dallas Cowboys’ stadium on game day is more than the entire country of Liberia, a country of 4 million people.</p> <p>President Obama recently announced an initiative called Power Africa, and a bipartisan bill called the Electrify Africa Act of 2013 is making its way through Congress.

Our jobs, security and global leadership depend on it. Foreign assistance, trade and investment are ways in which the US engages with the developing world. The world is changing — it’s wealthier and freer, and a growing number of countries are now able to pay for their own development, rather than through foreign aid. The demand side of the equation is changing and we need to change with it. For example, African governments collected $140bn in taxes in 2000, but $416bn in 2010. Compare that to the roughly $30bn of official development assistance from DAC countries and around $50bn of foreign direct investment that flow into Africa yearly. Big-ticket items like improving global health and food security will over time be paid for by developing country governments themselves.</p> <p>American foreign assistance matters. We need to use it for promoting democracy and good governance, things that philanthropy, private investment and sometimes states themselves won’t necessarily fund. If the private sector is the driver of development, we need to more creatively use foreign assistance in an investor- and private sector-friendly manner. This means sharing risk or enabling private enterprise, through policy reforms and technical assistance. But ultimately development is done by societies themselves, and we are supporting actors. That development requires entrepreneurs and capable governments, of which there are a growing number around the world, which is encouraging. The US also helped set up the Bretton Woods system and the regional development banks, and is often the largest shareholder in these institutions. It is in the American interest for the multilaterals to help developing countries plug into a Western-led form of globalisation. And it is increasingly challenging to sell foreign assistance in the face of a temporary flirtation with isolationism.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T19:02:16.641+01:00\">at 7.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-525e88c9e4b0760efba2ae1f\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-16T14:05:14.097+01:00\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Morning headlines: Wednesday 16 October</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Holly Young writes</em></p> <p>The global development news so far today.</p> <p>For those waking up in the US, happy <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/worldfoodday/en/%20\">World Food Day</a>!

The law required foreign financial institutions to report to the US government information on all of their US clients. Almost immediately, foreign governments demanded the same from the United States, leading to a flurry of intergovernmental agreements between the US and foreign nations — many of them developing countries — establishing a system of automatic exchange of tax information. </p> <p>In order for the law to work effectively, and in order for developing nations to benefit from it, each of these intergovernmental agreements needs to be negotiated and signed both by US treasury department officials and by their foreign counterparts. Unfortunately, with the US government shutdown for more than two weeks, those treasury department officials are unable to do their jobs. </p> <p>For example, while not representing a developing nation, French foreign minister, Pierre Moscovici, was in Washington this past weekend for the annual World Bank and IMF meetings.

First up: the Centre for Global Development. </p> <p>Since its founding in 2001, CGD has <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/page/about-cgd\">conducted research and analysis</a> on a wide range of <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/section/topics/\">topics</a> related to how policies and actions of the rich and powerful affect poor people in the developing world. After briefly meeting <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/expert/detail/2710/\">Lawrence MacDonald</a>, vice president for communications and policy outreach, <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org//page/staff#JOTT\">Jenny Ottenhoff</a>, who works on global health policy outreach and CGD fellow and well known twitterati voice <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/expert/detail/1423544/\">Owen Barder</a>, I sat down with <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org//page/staff#ECOL\">Erin Collinson</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org//page/staff#Jman\">John Osterman</a> to talk about the &apos;think and do&apos; tank&apos;s work and the particularities of working in Washington. Here&apos;s some of what they had to say.</p> <p>On models that CGD is currently championing, John spoke of the cash on delivery model - which is essentially paying for outcomes. A government gets some funding to help it begin a programme and as it meets indicators that have been agreed to, it gets more money.</p> <p>He acknowledged that the development community was still uncomfortable with this funding model because traditionally all of one&apos;s funding is allocated before the work starts and the prevailing culture requires that you spend it all. He explained that it was hard for institutions to go back to government and say: &quot;Your money has not been spent. But that&apos;s a good thing.&quot;</p> <p>Erin added that the reluctance to disburse funding in this way is also related to the fear of failure. &quot;It&apos;s about political messaging,&quot; she said. &quot;Money is allocated in the budget and if you don&apos;t spend it, your funding can be rescinded.&quot;</p> <p>On the particularities of trying to influence US development policy, Erin, who is the policy outreach associate, said: &quot;The US congress is very powerful, so while you can have conversations with agencies and departments, you end up going back to congress to see decisions made.&quot; There are advantages to that: congress is often said to be responsible for &quot;cooling the passions of the house [of representatives].&quot; On USAid, Erin reflected on what it means for the US commitment to development issues when the organisation&apos;s administrator isn&apos;t a cabinet level post. CGD has <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/blog/missing-usaid-administrator-new-qddr-bill\">written extensively on this</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525d8386e4b0010b6627a7a6\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T19:05:21.609+01:00\">7.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Poll: have you been affected by the US government shut down?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Holly Young writes</em></p> <p>As the shutdown enters its third week, attention in the US today has focused on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/15/congress-debt-deal-default-shutdown-republicans-boehner\">congressional discussions</a> over a default on the national debt and efforts to reopen the government.</p> <p>While USAid has been able to more or less keep the lights on, a recent <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/en/news/week-2-of-the-shutdown-impact-on-150-agencies/82072\">blog by Devex</a> suggests that the Millenium Challenge Corporation, the independent US government foreign aid agency, and the Peace Corps have not fared so well. So what types of organisations are being affected and what light does this shed on their relationship with USAid? And while the lights may still be on at USAid, with the possibility of a prolongued shutdown, should we be asking when they will begin to flicker?</p> <p>Before we delve into these wider questions we want to guage how far the global development community is being affected by the closure. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/poll/2013/oct/15/aid-usa\">Take the poll </a>and leave us a comment with your thoughts on how the shutdown has, and may potentially, affect your organisation.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525d6758e4b0081898d6deda\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T17:21:35.216+01:00\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">From our readers: the US and its role in international development finance</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Commenting on today&apos;s theme, our reader Jiesheng Li in Birmingham says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US shutdown of course harms development. US agencies won&apos;t have sufficient funding for future programmes or the resources available to support high level officials who are planning US development or &apos;quasi-development&apos; policies. CGD&apos;s Scott Morris for example notes that the US treasury&apos;s <a href=\"http://international.cgdev.org/blog/we-may-be-shut-down-world-keeps-working\">international affairs team will be curtailed</a> as they participate in the annual World Bank and IMF fund meetings.</p> <p>Heading back to US development policy in the international arena, the US must also consider the increasingly changing landscape of development finance. The seventeenth replenishment meeting of the International Development Association (IDA 17) is one arena where the US can make an impact. At the IDA 16, we saw an increased share of the total replenishment fund by the US, pushing it to be the top IDA contributor. With new shareholders adding to IDA’s resources, the US would naturally decrease its share. The US must ensure the decrease is not drastic. </p> <p>A second area the US must address is its contributions to IDA and UN trust funds. Trust funds are a good way of addressing emerging development topics when multilaterals cannot easily stage a programme. However, the proliferation of trust funds has produced aid fragmentation. The US should step back and consider how much of its development finance should go to trust funds and how effective they actually are. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525d5f8ae4b0570375570eb5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T16:55:17.936+01:00\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Content update: USAid and DfID join forces</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Holly Young writes</em></p> <p>At present, we know that over <a href=\"http://trachoma.org/world%E2%80%99s-leading-cause-preventable-blindness\">110 million people</a> are believed to live in areas where trachoma is endemic yet the exact distribution and disease burden of trachoma remains unclear. </p> <p>So is mapping the disease comprehensively the first step towards eradication?

Part of the story is generational: millions of young people around the world want to reshape the world for their own survival.

The need to save, exchange and pass seed on is so important to farming that it is <a href=\"http://www.gaiafoundation.org/climate-seed-and-knowledge\" title=\"\">embedded into cultural practices</a> around the world to ensure  future generations can have the seed diversity and complex farming knowledge they need to continue to grow food and develop crops.</p><p>But recent decades have seen a dramatic decrease in global seed diversity, for the first time in history. Since the introduction of the so-called Green Revolution of the 1960s, alongside <a href=\"http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/files/seed-giants_final_04424.pdf\" title=\"\">laws that restrict farmers' rights (pdf)</a> to save and exchange seed, agribusiness corporations have steadily increased sales of hybrid and GM crops. Genetic diversity and farmers' knowledge are the basis of farming; but as corporate seed and chemicals increasingly replace farmers' own ingenuity, they are now seen as mere customers. What was once agriculture is increasingly becoming agribusiness.</p><p>The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/jp/item/46803/icode/\" title=\"\">75% of the world's crop diversity has been lost</a> through this profound transformation of global food production. But as Christine Campeau, of the Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance, and fellow author of a <a href=\"http://www.gaiafoundation.org/seeds-for-life-scaling-up-agrobiodiversity-new-report\" title=\"\">report</a> published on Wednesday by EAA, the Gaia Foundation and the African Biodiversity Network, says: \"Too many farmers grow the same one or two varieties of purchased seed. But if the rains come too early or too late, too much or not at all, the entire crop may fail. As climate change increasingly hits agriculture, farmers are realising that the seed varieties that they grew, saved but then abandoned decades ago are the very varieties that they now need.\"</p><p>In its recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns of the catastrophic impact that climate change will have on food production. It is clear that the effects of climate change will be as unpredictable as they will be widespread. While it may be possible to predict particular events with some probability (eg saltwater flooding in Bangladesh and southern India, drought in the Horn of Africa, and hurricanes in the Philippines) it is also likely that regions will suffer from more than one type of extreme weather pattern. For example, Kenya in recent years has experienced a wide spectrum of extremes ranging from drought, heavy rains and unprecedented cold in concurrent seasons.</p><p>It is important to note that the global industrial food system contributes an estimated <a href=\"http://www.grain.org/article/entries/4357-food-and-climate-change-the-forgotten-link\" title=\"\">44-57% of global greenhouse gases</a> to climate change. In contrast, the world's small-scale farmers – the ones keeping agricultural diversity alive – provide 70% of all food eaten globally, using just 30% of the world's agricultural land.</p><p>Given the range of challenges that food systems will face in coming years, it is time for us to think seriously about how farmers will be able to keep growing food to feed the world. Not just to feed ourselves, but for the generations to come.</p><p>Policymakers such as the UK environment minister Owen Paterson believe GM corporations can deliver the world from hunger and malnutrition. But Paterson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/oct/14/gm-golden-rice-wicked-owen-paterson\" title=\"\">recent promotion of GM \"golden rice\"</a> as the answer to Vitamin A deficiency ignores the fact that $100m (£62m) has been spent on a technology still not proven to work (contrast this with simpler strategies that have been proven to work – such as simply growing and eating vegetables).</p><p>Farmers today and in the future will need to grow a wide diversity of crop varieties to spread their risk and deal with variable amounts of rain, changing temperatures, saline conditions, emerging pests and diseases, as well as a diversity of nutritional and medicinal needs. Imagine each seed variety taking millions of dollars and many years before corporations bring it to market, where it would need to be planted in huge monocultures to recoup the enormous investment. The inevitable outcome of this vision will be the disappearance of global crop diversity, while farmers struggle to access the seed that they – and the communities they feed – urgently need.</p><p>It is time for us to recognise that corporate and GM agriculture is part of the problem, and cannot be part of the solution. Instead, we need policies and practices that actively <a href=\"http://www.gaiafoundation.org/seeds-for-life-scaling-up-agrobiodiversity-new-report\" title=\"\">support the revival of seed diversity</a> and seed-saving knowledge in farmers' hands, and that ensure this is passed on to the generations to come.</p><p>It should shock us all to think of the wealth of crop diversity our generation has inherited from our farming ancestors, and how we have carelessly squandered this incalculable gift. We know that climate change is only going to get worse. If we do not take action to revive seed diversity and seed-saving knowledge in farmers' hands, we will be leaving a disastrously narrow gene pool from which future generations will struggle to farm and eat.</p><p>• Teresa Anderson is the <a href=\"http://www.gaiafoundation.org/meet-team\" title=\"\">Gaia Foundation</a>'s international advocacy co-ordinator</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/10/9/1349785787821/MDG--Seed-Freedom-Fortnig-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/oct/17/gm-agriculture-not-answer-seed-diversity","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/oct/17/gm-agriculture-not-answer-seed-diversity","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Local people 'need access to technology to survive disasters'","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-17T08:49:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2013/oct/17/local-people-access-technology-survive-disasters","fields":{"body":"<p>Lack of access to information and technology has a major bearing on people's ability to prepare for, survive and recover from disasters, according to the <a href=\"http://worlddisastersreport.org/en/\" title=\"\">2013 world disasters report</a>.</p><p></p><p>While new technologies greatly enhance the ability of disaster-affected communities to help themselves, the report, published by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Geneva on Thursday, says access to technology is deeply unequal. This digital divide is prominent in the most disaster-prone countries around the world.</p><p></p><p>The report emphasises that during the first critical hours after an emergency, most lives saved are actually by local people. Yet many of these first responders do not have access to basic life-saving information and tools, such as early warning systems and basic connectivity and network infrastructure.</p><p></p><p>The report also warns that as humanitarian agencies increasingly turn to new technologies as a source of information about disaster-affected communities' needs, they run the risk of only listening to those who are connected, and excluding those who are not. The report urges the private sector, humanitarian organisations, governments and local communities to work together to ensure access to technology for these poorest communities.</p><p></p><p>\"There are great examples of what can happen when technology experts and humanitarians put their heads together,\" said Ed Happ, the IFRC's global chief information officer. \"The IFRC and the telecommunications company Trilogy developed the Tera SMS system, which has allowed 3 million people in Haiti to receive hurricane warnings and disease prevention advice. We recently set it up in Sierra Leone, and our ambition is to launch Tera in 40 countries. But we can't do it alone, we need the private and public sectors to work with us.\"</p><p></p><p>This year's report focuses on the role of technology – its potential and its limitations. The widespread use of technology, particularly mobile phone texting, played a huge role in preventing a large loss of life when cyclone Phailin hit the state of Odisha in India last week. The 1999 cyclone in this region killed 10,000 people. This time, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-24546015\" title=\"\">27 people have died</a> so far.</p><p></p><p>\"Technology played a key role in keeping people informed before and during the cyclone,\" said Simon Eccleshall, IFRC head of disaster and crisis management. \"People were prepared. Technology made things quicker this time. Before, people were informed by loudhailer house to house. Now it's text message – people sharing information.\"</p><p></p><p>In another example of how organisations are using technology, the American Red Cross has set up a digital operations centre (DigiDoc), which allows social media posts from the disaster affected area to be tracked and integrated into response decision-making.</p><p></p><p>\"This gives the American Red Cross the ability to monitor positive or negative sentiment, displayed in real time,\" said Eccleshall. \"It shows where there is a problem, and allows headquarters to call a branch and ask what is going on to create a blip.\"</p><p></p><p>Last year saw the lowest number of deaths and people affected by disasters in the last 10 years, but in terms of costs 2012 was still the fifth most expensive year of the last decade. According to the IFRC, deaths from disasters in 2012 were 90% below the average for the decade. The number of disaster events is also among the decade's lowest.</p><p></p><p>In all, there were 552 disasters costing just under $158bn last year. The most expensive event was hurricane Sandy in the US, which cost $50bn; the deadliest was typhoon Bopha in the Philippines, which killed 1,901 people. Floods accounted for 53% of the 139 million affected by disasters in 2012, with the most severe taking place in China in April and June.</p><p></p><p>\"We got lucky last year, but we are by no means complacent,\" said Eccleshall. \"It's simply a matter of time before a large-scale disaster will impact a large number of people. The interesting trend is that big disasters have tended to be in high-income countries, whereas donors have looked at responding in low-income countries.\"</p><p></p><p>In a separate <a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/7491-geography-poverty-disasters-climate-change-2030\" title=\"\">report published on Wednesday, the Overseas Development Institute </a> (ODI) said governments should forget plans to end extreme poverty if they fail to come to terms with the increased risk of natural disasters in some of the poorest parts of the world.</p><p></p><p>The ODI estimated that around a third of a billion extremely poor people will be living in countries highly exposed to natural hazards by 2030 – more than the current population of the US. In sub-Saharan Africa, 118 million extremely poor people will face extreme weather hazards – with more than 20 million people at risk in countries such as Nigeria and Ethiopia.</p><p></p><p>Without addressing the current paltry levels of funding available for efforts to reduce the risk posed by natural disasters – just $0.40 in every $100 of aid – recent progress made in reducing global poverty efforts could be set back by \"a lifetime overnight\" in countries where drought, hurricanes and flash floods are a threat, warned the ODI.</p><p></p><p>According to the report, the 11 countries most at risk of disaster-induced poverty are Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda.</p><p></p><p>\"We know that disasters entrench poverty – they don't just end lives, they destroy shops, roads, crops, houses and hospitals in places where there are no safety nets such as insurance or social security,\" said Tom Mitchell, the ODI's head of climate change and one of the report's authors. \"Without meaningful change, talk of the end of extreme poverty is pie in the sky.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/10/16/1381927588302/MDG--Disasters--breached--003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/oct/17/local-people-access-technology-survive-disasters","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/oct/17/local-people-access-technology-survive-disasters","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Social work courses: seeking to master professional training","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-16T08:35:00Z","sectionId":"social-care-network","id":"social-care-network/2013/oct/16/social-work-courses-seeking-to-master-professional-training","fields":{"body":"<p>Amid all the controversy surrounding Frontline, the new workplace-based course for high flyers, it's easy to overlook the fact that the majority of postgraduate training of social workers will continue to be college-based.</p><p>Almost 70 universities across the UK now offer graduates with a first degree in a subject other than social work a two-year full-time – or longer part-time – route to a professional qualification. And behind the&nbsp;scenes, a quiet revolution is taking place, with universities adopting innovative and exciting ways of teaching while offering students a chance to carry out unique research.</p><p>An HIV support centre on the Uganda/Kenya border may be an unlikely place to find a group of social-work students from west London. But in a whitewashed building on Pallisa Road in Mbale, a group is working with charity The Aids Support Organisation (Taso) to offer counselling and help to thousands of children and people affected by the HIV virus. These students are on placement for their master's degree in social work at Kingston University, one of a growing number of higher education institutions whose courses are being held up as beacons of excellence.</p><p>At a time when social-work education is under two separate reviews, universities are increasingly developing specialisms in their postgraduate courses to offer students something extra, while continuing to provide generic training in adult and children's services. Specialisms ranging from international placements, such as those at Kingston, to digital citizenship or user involvement are designed to give students the skills they need for the profession in the 21st century.</p><p>In Mbale, students spend four weeks interviewing youngsters who either have HIV or have lost their parents to the virus. \"We are in a situation where there is a lot of flux and change,\" says Hilary Tompsett, chair of the Joint University Council Social Work Education Committee (SWEC), which represents schools of social work to government departments and internationally. \"All these courses have to meet regulator requirements, but growing numbers are trying to find something a bit different. They recruit high-calibre students – they have to get at least a 2:1 to get a place, and half of the Russell Group universities offer these courses.\"</p><p>A series of high-profile social-work failures has led the government to focus on recruiting elite graduates on to fast-track, work-based schemes.</p><p>First there was the 14-month pilot Step Up to Social Work, which has recruited its last scheduled cohort, and now there is Frontline, the \"Teach First for social work\". This aims to&nbsp;recruit two intakes of 100 graduate high flyers each to work in children's services. Yet, at the same time, there has been an explosion in postgraduate provision, rising from a quarter of all social-work courses to a third in the past five years.</p><p>At Kingston, links have been forged with other countries to give students on the master's degree an insight into how social work is practised overseas. Aimed at making students more culturally aware, the course offers them the chance to spend 20-day placements in Uganda or on projects as far-flung as India, Jamaica, Finland and Brazil. Recruitment numbers have soared: last year, the university took on 40 students, almost double the number in previous years.</p><p>\"When we designed the course in 2006, we came from the idea that, as London was&nbsp;multicultural, so we wanted to train practitioners who were multicultural,\" says course leader Wilson Muleto. \"We looked at requirements and realised we could be innovative – international placements are now a key feature of the programme and offer a unique international perspective into inter-agency working and shared practices.\"</p><p>Kingston is not the only university with international links and relationships with NGOs and universities overseas. Birmingham, which has been teaching social work for more than a century, also arranges exchange visits to Nuremberg and Rotterdam, where there are street lectures on prostitution and drug taking.</p><p>The visits open up a professional dialogue and allow students to examine how other countries approach issues such as sex work, drugs and asylum seekers – and how they are more likely to adopt a preventive approach to social work practice.</p><p>This also allows Birmingham to highlight its close working relationships with service users – a key plank of recent social-work reforms. In what is seen as a gold standard for other universities, \"survivors\" – who include care-leavers, users of mental health or drug and alcohol services, people with physical and learning disabilities, and carers – are involved in all aspects of the course, from admissions to roleplay, assessments and presentations at conferences and workshops.</p><p>\"We have championed the voice of service users for over two decades and are way ahead of legislation and leading the&nbsp;way in Europe,\" says Dawn Rivers, admissions tutor at Birmingham. \"Some higher education institutions might tick the box on this, but we are completely committed. Our Survivor Arts [programme] allows survivors to share their stories through art and lead&nbsp;workshops.\"</p><p>The use of social media and digital technology is also a standout feature of the&nbsp;course: it is integrated into inquiry-based blended learning to teach child protection. Before starting the course, students are taught about personal and professional boundaries on social media, and are shown how to use it appropriately while recognising its potential for collaborative learning.</p><p>Tarsem Singh Cooner, a teaching fellow at Birmingham who is behind the programme , has also developed a social-work app, designed for use by trainees on placement, which students can use to check their knowledge.</p><p>These examples of innovative teaching in Birmingham and Kingston are not isolated – other  universities are also offering&nbsp;something extra for social-work students. Although scope is limited, with basic course content strictly regulated by the Health and Care Council and endorsed by the College of Social Work, many students are able to specialise when they do their dissertation.</p><p>Jonathan Parker, professor of social work and director of the centre for social work and social policy at Bournemouth University, believes the importance of dissertations cannot be underestimated.  With Bournemouth specialising in research into vulnerable adults, he says, students might choose to investigate the abuse of older people with dementia or of people with learning disabilities.</p><p>Peter Castleton, professor of social work&nbsp;at Sheffield University, agrees that dissertations offer students a \"fantastic opportunity\" to look in depth at society and social-work practices.</p><p>\"The world is very different today to 10 years ago and social-work education has changed with it, offering a mix of online learning, classes and seminars and inter- professional training,\" says Castleton.</p><p>\"However, dissertations are really valuable and help students make an important contribution to leading the profession into the future.\"</p><h2>Uganda Multi-agency work in action</h2><p>James Hollingworth has never looked back since going on an international placement with The Aids Support Organisation (Taso) in Uganda – and says the experience offered him a unique insight into a different culture, as well as multi-agency work.</p><p>The 31-year-old graduated from Kingston University with a master's degree in social work three years ago. But he believes the lessons he learned during his four weeks in Mbale inform his work today as a social worker for Derbyshire youth offending team. </p><p>With many universities offering just one, 200-day placement, Kingston's three placements of 70, 20 and 110 days gave Hollingworth the prospect of a broader range of experience. </p><p>After his first 70-day stint with a frontline child-protection assessment team in the UK, he decided to apply for the Uganda placement because it offered an opportunity to \"do something you wouldn't normally do\".</p><p>\"It was very useful to see joined-up working in practice,\" says Hollingworth. \"It was a very good experience in terms of career development and individual development – I had an experience of life with totally different concerns. They were more flexible in practice and far more creative interventions took place. That is something I still think about.\"</p><p>The placement was not without its challenges. Local transport was by matatus – old minibus-type taxis that are supposed to carry up to eight people, but usually have about 35 on board. Attitudes to timekeeping were also different – and took getting used to. \"In Uganda, it's a very relaxed atmosphere - if you say nine o'clock, that could mean anytime up to three o'clock,\" says Hollingworth. \"It's whenever it happens!</p><p>\"Obviously there are societal and cultural issues that are very different and can be challenging, such as poverty and attitudes towards homosexuality and criminal justice. Working with children who have HIV is tough. They may have lost all their family to HIV, they don't even have enough money for food – yet they're doing brilliantly at school, getting up at 2am to do extra homework. And they're just the nicest children ever. That's very humbling.\"</p><p>Working for the Taso project gave Hollingworth an insight into good multi-agency working – and, back home, he shared his learning by doing a project comparing Taso with the work of UK HIV charity, Terrence Higgins Trust.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/commercial/2013/10/15/1381845705107/Social-care-training-cour-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2013/oct/16/social-work-courses-seeking-to-master-professional-training","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/social-care-network/2013/oct/16/social-work-courses-seeking-to-master-professional-training","sectionName":"Social Care Network"},{"webTitle":"Waris Dirie: 'Female genital mutilation is pure violence against girls'","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-14T18:01:47Z","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","id":"lifeandstyle/2013/oct/14/waris-dirie-female-genital-mutilation-fgm","fields":{"body":"<p>Waris Dirie was about five years old when she was left in a makeshift shelter under a tree for several days to recover from her \"operation\", like all the girls in her community, she had undergone female circumcision, more accurately known as female genital mutilation (FGM). She still remembers her anger. \"When they tried to convince me that God wants this, I said: 'Did my God hate me so much?' I remember telling my mother: 'If he hates me, then I don't want him.'\" In the days after FGM, many girls die from blood loss or infection. Dirie says she lay there, talking to God, saying \"make me stay alive. You owe me this now.\"</p><p>Dirie, born to a nomadic family in Somalia, describes herself as not exactly the kind of daughter dreamed of by the traditional families in her community. As a very young child, she was wilful and headstrong, constantly questioning everything. When she was about 13, her father announced that she would be married to a man in his 60s. \"I knew [most married women in her community] put up with everything and anything. Any abuse, hopelessness, and I thought, was I here to be used and be abused? I knew there was so much I could do with my life, but on my terms.\"</p><p>Her terms have led to an extraordinary life and we meet in a London hotel room as Dirie prepares to receive a <a href=\"http://www.womenoftheyear.co.uk/\">Woman of the Year award</a> for her campaign work. Under the threat of her impending marriage, she ran away, running barefoot across the desert for days until she reached relatives in Mogadishu. From there, she managed to make it to London – an aunt was married to Somalia's ambassador to Britain – and she worked as their maid for several years. When they returned to Somalia, she stayed on, learned English and got a job at McDonald's, eventually being spotted by a photographer. By the 1990s, Dirie had become a supermodel, fronting Chanel campaigns and appeared in the James Bond film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/05/living-daylights-favourite-bond-film\" title=\"\">The Living Daylights</a>.</p><p>Modelling could be fun, but ultimately wasn't fulfilling. \"I thought, 'This is bullshit, fake.' I couldn't sleep one more night knowing the truth about what was happening to girls and look all …\" She gives a mock smile as if posing in a fashion shoot. \"I just knew that I had to tell the world that there was torture, an undercover war against women. But this is not one person's war – all of us have to do something.\" Now, she says, there is more awareness of FGM, but in the 1990s, \"what really made me take a stand was that nobody was doing anything\".</p><p>Dirie's profile had given her a voice and when she went public, in a magazine interview in 1997, about what had happened to her, and her desire to stop FGM, largely practised in communities in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, it created a great deal of attention. She was appointed a UN special ambassador; in 2002, she set up her <a href=\"http://www.desertflowerfoundation.org/en/\" title=\"\">Desert Flower Foundation</a> to campaign against the practice.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organisation\" title=\"\">World Health Organisation</a> estimates there are about 140 million women in the world who have had FGM, from removal of the clitoral hood to the whole excision of external genitalia before the vagina is sewn up, with only a small hole left for urine and menstrual blood. It usually happens before the age of 15, and in some cases is performed on babies, in the belief that the girl will grow up \"clean\", her \"honour\" intact along with her virginity as a way of preparing her for marriage; this happens to 3&nbsp;million girls every year. Aside from the intense pain and risk of infection at the time, it carries lasting consequences: difficulty urinating, sex is painful and pleasure-free, and childbirth can be fatal both to the baby and the mother. Botched FGM can leave women doubly&nbsp;incontinent and ostracised by their communities.</p><p>In many countries, it is a crime, though one in the UK at least which has failed to lead to any prosecutions. Why does she think so little has been done to eradicate it? \"Anything to do with females is considered less important,\" she says. The other argument she hears is that it is a \"cultural\" practice – tolerated on one side by people who don't want to be seen as racist if they interfere; ignored on the other side by people who are not interested because it&nbsp;doesn't affect them.</p><p>\"If a white man or woman saw a white child that is mutilated, there would be screaming. I guarantee it would end,\" she says. \"This is abuse against a child, so to say this is your 'thing', it's to do with your religion or race, it's all wrong. This is about child protection. I don't see anything else, and I think it's covered up by racism, and the idea that 'I don't want to get involved'. It's pure violence against girls, and it destroys the rest of their lives. And for what? For who?\"</p><p>It also doesn't help that the practice is so hidden. \"As long as the problem stays undercover then nothing much happens, or at least not fast enough,\" says Dirie. \"If we put it into the open, if it's on TV and in the newspaper, if we have politicians and religious leaders talking about it and saying no, then we fight it together.\"</p><p>It isn't only something that happens in rural communities in Africa or Asia. This summer, the <a href=\"http://www.nspcc.org.uk/inform/resourcesforprofessionals/minorityethnic/female-genital-mutilation_wda96841.html\" title=\"\">NSPCC opened its first helpline</a> to support girls at risk of FGM in the UK – figures are difficult to come by, but one study estimates there are 66,000 women in England and Wales living with FGM, and 20,000 girls are at risk.</p><p>It happens in immigrant communities, says Dirie, \"because first of all the community stick together. They bring the same behaviour, even though they live right here in London. So the child doesn't know any different but follows the rule of the parent and what they think is the right thing. We need teachers, doctors, social workers, the police – all these people have to be informed, open and talk to the community.\"</p><p>Last month, in Berlin, Dirie opened the first of what will be several medical centres to offer women who have endured FGM reconstructive surgery. Over the next year or so, she hopes to open other clinics in Kenya, Ethiopia, the Netherlands and Switzerland. But she says, \"I don't want to put too much focus on it, because the whole point is to stop this mutilation in the first place. We don't have to have special hospitals to reconstruct a God-given thing.\" She would like to do other things – sing, act, be a fashion designer for women of all shapes and sizes. \"But&nbsp;then I think I can't turn back, not now I'm almost there. You just have to keep going until one day it will come to an end.\"</p><p>Dirie, now 48 and living  in Poland with her four children, says the emails and calls from suicidal women, and the knowledge that thousands of girls are still enduring FGM every day, still makes her angry and can be exhausting. But she is hopeful. \"The&nbsp;world is changing, especially with technology, [people have access to] any information. I don't want little girls to be like me, to travel the world to find out that this doesn't happen [to all women] and what has happened is wrong.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/14/1381772133248/Waris-Dirie-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/14/waris-dirie-female-genital-mutilation-fgm","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/14/waris-dirie-female-genital-mutilation-fgm","sectionName":"Life and style"},{"webTitle":"GM crops: is opposition to golden rice wicked?","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-14T17:40:10Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2013/oct/14/gm-crops-is-opposition-to-golden-rice-wicked","fields":{"body":"<div id=\"block-525c3fb6e4b0931fa88f555f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T20:04:10.140+01:00\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Late reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://%20www.AJStein.de/cv/golden_rice.htm\">Alexander J. Stein</a>, an agricultural economist with the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, DC, who did his PhD on the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of Golden Rice has been actively involved in today&apos;s Twitter debate and sent in this late addition.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A lot of the discussion about Golden Rice – which is directly conflated with the commercial development and cultivation of GM crops in western countries – boils down to money: How much profit do private corporations derive from GMOs? What kind of ownership rights do companies get over agricultural crops? Do farmers benefit from the cultivation of GM crops? What is in it for consumers? How much public money should be spent on research and development of GM crops, and on what kind of crops? etc.</p> <p>Earlier this year I addressed the question of what the <a href=\"http://ajstein.tumblr.com/post/59506080187/\">best use of public resources</a> is when it comes to micronutrient interventions, and how the impact and <a href=\"http://ajstein.tumblr.com/post/59564578973/\">cost-effectiveness of Golden Rice</a> can be assessed in comparison with other interventions and across different time horizons. The key conclusion is that Golden Rice offers a very promising intervention that could complement other current interventions, above all supplementation with vitamin A pills, in a cost-effective way. That is, Golden Rice could help reach people who fall through the cracks of current interventions and it could reduce overall spending on vitamin A interventions, thus freeing up scarce resources in the fields of public health and nutrition in developing countries.</p> <p>To also address this question: Whether genetic engineering is more risky than other breeding methods or whether GM crops pose any particular risk has been answered in decades of food safety and biosafety research in hundreds of studies: it is not.</p> <p>Therefore, while Minister Paterson may have used bold language and was optimistic regarding the time frame in which Golden Rice can have an impact, his overall message is true, namely that Golden Rice could help save the lives and improve the health and well-being of children and pregnant women across large parts of Asia, that there is no particular risk connected to GM crops as such and that, consequently, opponents of Golden Rice place their larger political agenda above the lives and health of poor people elsewhere.</p> <p>People who disagree with the framework in which GM crops are developed and used in the western world should target this framework, be it the promotion of weaker patent rights, the facilitation of more competition in the field of agricultural biotechnology to reduce the market power of the incumbents or the support of more public and humanitarian research, but they should not throw out the (vitamin A deficient) baby with the bath water.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525c0857e4b0daf4692ecf90\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T18:40:10.105+01:00\">6.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">My verdict</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This has been a challenging and forthright debate with, so far as I can tell, right and wrong on both sides. My personal view on golden rice is that, as a technology with potential to alleviate some degree of suffering in the developing world, it must be treated with respect. But the debate about this crop has long become divorced from the rice itself. It is now compromised by the rolling rancour surrounding the politics of GM food.</p> <p>There are a couple of points of divergence about golden rice that I think can be cleared up here. </p> <p>Firstly, golden rice seems genuinely open source in regards to its patent ownership. If it proves to be useful in counteracting malnutrition it will not simply feed into the agri-capital combine. I don&apos;t see any reason to disbelieve the project on this. However if you have evidence to the contrary then please email me. </p> <p>Secondly, regardless of interference from Greenpeace and others, golden rice remains a very long way from the developing world&apos;s dinner plate. The science and the regulatory process still have a long way to go. </p> <p>The reasons for this distance to their goal are legion. Mostly it is because this type of research takes time. But the process has been complicated because golden rice has become a lightning rod for a set of interest groups that run the gambit from development, to environment, to morality. The effect this has had on the research has been profound. At every step scientists have been exposed to a level of scrutiny and public interest that outweighs the relevance of this (so far unproven) project. As Sally Brooks says, this is not an environment conducive to open, efficient research.</p> <p>But the assertion that the delay of golden rice is wicked, places Owen Paterson on shaky ground. First of all, it has no basis in science. As I have said, the effectiveness of golden rice has not been proven, so the claim that lives could have been lost is entirely speculative. Further, the co-option of the project as a poster child for GM tech has placed the scientists in the project under duress and compromised the work they are attempting to do. </p> <p>This should not be read as a defence or otherwise of anti-GM groups. The idea that golden rice is a trojan horse to soften the ground for a barrage of GM technologies may have some truth. But should that cause us to ignore it completely? That seems irresponsible. Rather it should lead us to discussions and awareness of how we manage this type of technology&apos;s ownership and control it for the benefit of those who truly need it.</p> <p>Thankyou to everyone who contributed today. I will be back with another eco audit next week.</p> <p><em>*Please note that I have changed this article to say that golden rice is still a long way from developing world people because of the long regulatory process and some science still to be completed and not, as I originally said, because the science alone is lacking.</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T22:52:42.868+01:00\">at 10.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-525c258ee4b06d1ee57118e1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T18:31:19.426+01:00\">6.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian&apos;s environment editor John Vidal, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/oct/14/gm-golden-rice-wicked-owen-paterson\">news piece </a>about this is now online, has just sent me some comment of his own:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last few weeks have seen a remarkable number of favourable articles about golden rice, a product that has not been fully tested and is certainly is not for sale yet. They mostly say how many children it could save and blame Greenpeace and western NGOs for delaying for as much as 12 years the commercialisation of the rice variety across Asia. </p> <p>But where does this enmity to Greenpeace, a mere non-government group, without much influence in the Asian corridors of power, come from? </p> <p>The origins of the row seem to go back to 2000 when Time magazine claimed, “This rice could save a million kids a year.” Then, in February this year, the “reluctant environmentalist” Bjorn Lomborg claimed that “in the last 12 years, about 8 million kids have died from Vitamin A deficiency. He asked, pointedly: &quot;Are anti-GM advocates not at least partially responsible?”</p> <p>Fast forward to August 2013 when the journal Scientific American <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=labels-for-gmo-foods-are-a-bad-idea\">argued </a>that Greenpeace and other anti-GMO organisations were using “misinformation and hysteria to delay the introduction of Golden Rice to the Philippines, India and China”. This was followed in September with 11 senior scientists saying in US Science <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1320.full\">journal</a> that golden rice should be allowed : “If ever there was a clear-cut cause for outrage, it is the concerted campaign by Greenpeace and other nongovernmental organisations, as well as by individuals, against Golden Rice”, they said.</p> <p>After that we had US controversialist and former Greenpeace activist-turned-virulent-critic Patrick Moore setting up a new campaign group Allow Golden Rice Now! Moore accused Greenpeace and its allies of killing 8 million children by delaying the introduction of the rice into SE Asia. Then on October 5. Moore and British pro GM campaigner Mark Lynas appeared on the Today programme claiming that Greenpeace and its allies were “blocking the cure”. </p> <p>But what exactly is the evidence that Greenpeace or any other western did actually manage to delay its introduction? The spat seems to go back to 2008 when Tufts university researchers from Boston, backed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), conducted a human trial of Golden Rice on a group of 24 boys and girls in Hunan province, China. This was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and was spotted by Greenpeace, who told the Chinese authorities. A mighty furore ensued after it emerged that not all the parents of the children knew it was GM rice. </p> <p>But even this was not the end of the story. On September 18, after a one year investigation, Tufts university took the highly unusual step of barring the principal investigator from doing any further human research for 2 years and admitted flaws in the study. The backers of golden rice were, to say the least, highly embarrassed and Greenpeace, from being an irritant, became the devil incarnate. You could surmise that the scientific Establishment has been rounded up not just to promote golden rice, but to defend US science itself.</p> </blockquote> <p>Patrick Moore left his reply in the thread later this evening:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27940475\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11904277\" title=\"View ecosense’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for ecosense\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11904277\" title=\"View ecosense’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">ecosense</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27940475\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">14 October 2013 10:11pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>I am a Canadian ecologist/environmentalist, not a US environmentalist. </p> <p>The nutritional studies on Chinese children, conducted after studies on animals and US adults, was carried out with the support of the US National Institutes of Health and a number of Chinese medical and science organizations. Signed approval was obtained from the parents. Greenpeace caused a scandal by Tweeting &quot;American scientists are using Chinese children as guinea pigs for potentially toxic rice&quot;. (The lead American scientist in the US/China collaboration is a Chinese American). This sensationalism and disinformation predictably caused a political uproar and Chinese authorities paid for their jobs so politicians could save face. The study proved that Golden Rice is effective. That is why Greenpeace and their fellow travellers are trying to trash it. They should go to Hell for what they are doing but unfortunately Hell is dead along with God. I am a secular person myself but this makes me with there was a God who could punish these evil people. (I know the Minister gas to choose his words carefully and &quot;wicked&quot; is softer than evil but I am sure that is what he meant rather than as in &quot;that's a wicked pair of sunglasses).</p> <p>Golden rice is nothing more than normal rice with beta carotene, an essential nutrient, in the grain of rice. There are no genes in a grain of rice, they are in the plant. Unfortunately rice does not send beta carotene to the grain of rice but all green plants, including rice, have beta carotene in their leaves. also unfortunate, rice leaves are inedible. There is nothing in Golden Rice that could even remotely cause a problem. Greenpeace says there could be &quot;health issues&quot;. Is 2 million dead kids a year not a &quot;health issue&quot; What health issue caused by Golden Rice could be worse than that? As for &quot;environmental effects&quot; every plant on earth has the same beta carotene in it as Golden Rice.</p> <p>I relish the day when Greenpeace's position on this subject is buried in public understanding.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T22:28:23.931+01:00\">at 10.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-525c11aee4b0daf4692ecf93\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T17:06:04.051+01:00\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sally Brooks, a York University social researcher specialising in international development, technological change in agriculture and food policy, spoke to me about her research into golden rice. For those who want to do some background reading, Brooks conducted a study on the <a href=\"https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=2&amp;ik=71b51548de&amp;view=att&amp;th=141b79d2c3018760&amp;attid=0.1.1&amp;disp=inline&amp;safe=1&amp;zw&amp;saduie=AG9B_P80iskZb5ap586C8e_8-GfY&amp;sadet=1381765786200&amp;sads=KlH3xKgYlX9_uFrb6lqQyDuKaYM&amp;sadssc=1\">lessons to be learned</a> for biofortification projects from the golden rice experience.</p> <p>Brooks said the technology still required an enormous amount of research to be done in order to be able to assess its potential to save lives. Notably, she said the main obstacles that lie in front of the science were not the anti-GM lobby or regulation, but the simple technical difficulty of producing the crop.</p> <p>She said yesterday was not the first time Owen Paterson had referred to the golden rice project&apos;s moral imperative. In a Radio 4 Today Programme interview in June this year, Paterson said: &quot;Over the last 15 years … every attempt to deploy this golden rice has been thwarted. And in that time, seven million children have gone blind or died.&quot;</p> <p><a href=\"http://stepscentre-thecrossing.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/golden-rice-and-gm-crop-debate.html\">In a blogpost in June</a>, Brooks said the co-option of the golden rice project into the wider GM debate (by both sides) had hindered the genuine attempts of scientists to study the potential of this crop:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decision to back GM crops was presented as a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2344789/Owen-Paterson-Back-GM-food-children-die.html#ixzz2X3YGx7Lf\">matter of life and death</a>... The implication was clear - those who had ‘thwarted’ attempts to deploy a life-saving technology bore some responsibility for this tragic outcome. Such people, Paterson suggested, &quot;should really reflect&quot;.<br />This is not the first time that the specific case of the Golden Rice project has been deployed as the lynchpin of an argument for policy and regulatory changes to accelerate the commercialisation on GM crops in general. This is problematic for a number of reasons which <a href=\"http://practicalaction.metapress.com/content/83x033472mqp517v/?p=b419fde8043b4f0d8e68b2bcf5181630&amp;pi=6\">I have set out in a new article</a>.</p> <p>As well as bringing more heat than light to an already overheated debate, the deployment of Golden Rice as ‘poster child’ in the GM crop debate has had serious consequences for the way the research has been carried out ‘on the ground’ over the years. In research stations in Southeast Asia, the pressure cooker environment surrounding the project has not been conducive to the kind of open discussion and debate – among crop scientists, nutritionists, public health experts, and others – that an ambitious research effort such as this warrants and requires. Unfortunately, too much hype ‘upstream’ has tended to close down opportunities for open scientific enquiry and debate ‘downstream’, just where it is most needed. <br />A <a href=\"http://www.irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=12483\">recent statement</a> issued by the International Rice Research Institute, based in the Philippines (due to be the first country to commercialise Golden Rice) was therefore an important moment in the history of the project. Why was it so important? Because it stated, unambiguously, what is still a key unknown – whether Golden Rice will actually improve the nutritional status of malnourished children and adults. Moreover, it states clearly that the remaining stages of the project, which include both regulatory assessment and nutrition studies to establish whether Golden Rice does indeed have potential to prevent malnutrition-induced child blindness and mortality, will take ‘two years or more’.<br />It is important, therefore, that at this critical stage in the project, the researchers and their partners in the Philippines are able to complete these studies – and, most importantly, openly share their results, whatever the outcome – unencumbered by inflated expectations and claims generated in support of the adoption of agricultural biotechnologies elsewhere. In the meantime, the GM crop debate in the UK would surely be better served by evidence sourced much closer to home. </p> </blockquote> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/sally-brooks/investing-in-food-security-on-philanthrocapitalism-biotechnology-and-development\">further piece </a>by Brooks raises the issue that again, the cart has been put in front of the horse. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An important but less well understood dimension of the controversy was the transfer of the outputs of public sector research to a private company, Syngenta, in exchange for assistance in negotiating unanticipated intellectual property restrictions. The inventors and their new sponsors presented this transfer of ownership in wholly positive terms, however, heralding the creation of a ‘new type of public-private partnership’ which allowed free transfer of patented technologies to public institutions in developing countries, who would then be able to adapt and disseminate the new, nutrient-dense varieties to resource-poor farmers in South and Southeast Asia.</p> <p>In 2002, the Golden Rice materials were transferred to the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. A ‘Humanitarian Board’, which included the inventors, donors (including the Rockefeller Foundation) and a Syngenta representative, had by then issued a ‘humanitarian license’ enabling IRRI and its partners to begin the time consuming task of ‘back-crossing’ the Golden Rice ‘trait’ into <em>Indica</em> varieties that grow in tropical climates in Southeast Asia. By 2008, IRRI scientists had stabilised germplasm ready for open field trials.</p> <p>The BMGF joined the Golden Rice project as a co-funder in 2003. Despite a lack of evidence at the time of the effectiveness of ‘bio-fortified’ (nutritionally enhanced) crops in combatting malnutrition, the Foundation took a ‘leap of faith’ and funded a series of ‘biofortification’ initiatives, including the Golden Rice project. Following completion of the field trials in 2011, the BMGF announced a further $10m in funding for long-awaited nutritional testing and preparation for regulatory assessment in the Philippines and Bangladesh. These activities are still ongoing.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a consistent theme running through Golden Rice project communications over the years has been an emphasis on the <em>institutional</em>constraints and achievements, which has diverted attention from the faltering progress of the research itself. The celebration of the project as a ‘new type of public-private partnership’, as the only way forward in negotiating the ‘maze’ of patents, is a case in point.</p> <p>Juxtaposed against the success story of a ‘humanitarian license’ facilitating access to a patented technology was a more negative story of regulatory hurdles standing between the technology and its beneficiaries. In this context, Golden Rice was afforded a very different, ‘virtual’ identity in policy and public discourse as a symbol of the thwarted promise of GM crops. In contrast to its messy reality as experimental material in the laboratory and greenhouse, Golden Rice was reconstructed as a proven technology and answer to vitamin A deficiency, which, but for unnecessarily burdensome biosafety regulation and irrational opposition, would already be in farmers’ fields and saving lives.</p> </blockquote> <p>Adrian Dubock from the Golden Rice Project sent me this response to Brook&apos;s words:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>She is however a little out of date. Elsewhere in the blog chain I have quoted a number of the key findings about Golden Rice and its potential. She seems unaware of Tang et al 2012 for example. </p> <p>And she also leaves the wrong impression about the publicity sought by the humanitarian Golden Rice project. To my (pretty good) knowledge of the history there have only been ever three (maybe four) press releases relating to it, two (or three) by Syngenta in 2001 and 2004/5, and one by IRRI &amp; Gates Foundation announcing a Gates Foundation grant to IRRI for Golden Rice work, which only started in December 2010. Indeed the Humanitarian Board took an early decision not to talk about the project until there was something to report.</p> <p>Sally Brooks mentions Golden Rice being funded by Gates from 2003. That is incorrect. In 2005 Gates Foundation as part of it’s Grand Challenges in Global Health competitively awarded a grant to Prof Peter Beyer’s University of Freiburg (Germany) laboratory to investigate with collaborators making Golden Rice more nutritionally biofortified.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T17:40:04.488+01:00\">at 5.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-525c0320e4b0daf4692ecf8b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T15:55:58.321+01:00\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Your comments</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There has been a tremendous volume of excellent responses in the comment thread.

The The GMO complex needs poster children which will allegedly “feed the world” and cure disease. </p> <p>Its other use is as a Trojan horse: it is pushed by USAID and other corporate front organizations posing as “humanitarian”. In the guise of offering GMO-based ”humanitarian aid” they try to get countries to lift import restrictions on GMOs.</p> <p>The original golden rice, called “GR 1?, had such a meager amount of vitamin A that you’d need twelve times the normal daily intake to get the nutritionally necessary amount. Meanwhile even this amount must be accompanied by the sufficient right kinds of fats and oils in the diet to digest it. This tends to be lacking in the overall diets of the people this rice is supposed to be “fed to”. <br /> <br />The new paradigm is “Golden Rice 2? (GR2), which allegedly would provide enough vitamin A in a normal serving. (It still wouldn’t work outside the right cuisine.) But this version, just like its forerunner, has languished in the test fields for years as breeders try to backcross the Japonica cultivar (the only type which has actually existed in the laboratory, but which isn’t suited for field production) with Indica varieties actually grown by farmers. So far an Indica variety of golden rice doesn’t exist. <br /> <br />The fact is that <a href=\"http://www.gmwatch.org/index.php/news/archive/2013/15023-golden-rice-myths\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>“golden rice” is just vaporware</b></a>, and all the claims that “environmentalists” are obstructing it are false. If everyone on Earth supported golden rice, it still wouldn’t be ready for prime time, and probably never will be. But then, this bogus claim is part of the propaganda value of the idea of ”golden rice”, which is far more valuable to the cartel than the actual rice itself will ever be. That’s why Syngenta’s made such a big show of “donating” its patent. It has no expectation that golden rice will ever be widely commercialised. </p> <p>Meanwhile the propagandists, telling one lie about environmentalist obstruction out of one side of their mouths, out of the other side are simultaneously claiming that golden rice is already saving lives. Obviously these can’t both be true at the same time. In fact neither are true. The rice doesn’t really exist, and the reason for this is technical, not political.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the Philippines there are already programs in action right now which are using dietary supplements to alleviate VAD and visual problems related to it. These programs are far less expensive than golden rice research, and far less expensive than the subsidies required for its commercialization would be.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T16:42:37.724+01:00\">at 4.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-525bfddbe4b0daf4692ecf86\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T15:38:34.169+01:00\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Key event</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This debate is a real Pandora&apos;s box.

He told me that about half a dozen companies held patent rights to technologies used in golden rice. But at the advent of the research, he and its inventors convinced all of these companies to waive their proprietary claims to the technology. On the anti-GM campaign he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It seems to come down to major distrust of capitalism and commercial interests.

For the record, when I called Paterson&apos;s Defra press office this morning they said he had been commenting in a private capacity. But WDM suggest he is motivated by the British government&apos;s agribusiness concerns.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Owen Paterson has grabbed the headlines again, this time for accusing environmental groups opposed to GM crops of being “wicked”, potentially condemning millions of people in the global south to premature death.</p> <p>Before even considering the claim, we should consider who is making it. Paterson is the head of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). He doesn’t work in international development. So why this concern for citizens of developing countries? It turns out that Defra, along with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the Department for International Development (DfID) have a joint ‘agricultural technology’ strategy which is very much about promoting UK agribusiness interests – including in new markets overseas – and very little about (in fact, diametrically opposed to) a just and sustainable food system.</p> <p> If we were concerned about a food system which prioritised people’s need, we would need a radically different distribution of power and resources. As we all know, there’s more than enough food to feed the world’s population – the problem is access. Malnutrition in the global south is almost exclusively a result of people’s inability to access enough food, or a sufficiently varied diet. The way to solve it is to improve incomes – not to hand power to the multinationals that already control our food system, further squeezing producers and forcing them into an industrial monoculture production that posits Golden Rice as a solution rather than a problem. Already 10 companies control three-quarters of the global seed market, and the current drive for more GM is only likely to result in further concentration.</p> <p>But don’t take it from an NGO. On Saturday, opponents of corporate control of food and seeds took part in demonstrations on every continent. Marches or protests were held in over 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, from Ghana and Kenya to Bolivia and Indonesia. This is not about western NGOs pushing an anti-GM line: farmers themselves in the global south are mobilising to reject GM because it means greater agribusiness control over seeds. Pro-corporate legislation is restricting farmers’ rights to breed and exchange seed adapted to their local environment (crucial in the face of climate change) and instead forcing them to purchase new seed each year.</p> <p>African groups reject the agribusiness-friendly initiatives supported by northern governments, such as the G8’s New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition and the Gates-sponsored AGRA (“Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa”) which is handing control of their food systems over to multinationals at the expense of the small-scale producers who feed most of the world’s population. Without a change in direction from the UK government and its allies, we can expect to see more poverty and malnutrition on a global scale, not less.</p> </blockquote> <p>Friends of the Earth director of policy and campaigns Craig Bennett said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some of the greatest threats to food security include climate change, soil degradation, and a lack of agricultural diversity – and it is highly doubtful that more intensive forms of agriculture such as GM crops will deliver on these issues for farmers or food supply.</p> <p>“Friends of the Earth is not campaigning on golden rice. We are putting our effort into campaigning for tried and tested measures that have been shown to deliver real solutions for farmers and nutrition - such as boosting yields by protecting soils, better water management and affordable access to seeds.</p> <p>“What could be termed as wicked is a Minister who turns a blind eye to evidence of the very real threat of climate change on food security and the world’s children, and instead puts his faith in unproven silver bullet measures.” </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27923556\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10230223\" title=\"View Matthew2012’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Matthew2012\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10230223\" title=\"View Matthew2012’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Matthew2012</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27923556\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">14 October 2013 12:36pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Golden rice is very much the poster boy of the GM lobby.

It is simply a question of getting the resources to the right place. </p> <p>The fact that debate is trying to be silenced by a minister presenting those opposing Golden rice as &quot;wicked&quot; is unacceptable. You only need to read the marketing to see that this is largely a PR project:</p> <p>For example:</p>  <blockquote>  <p><i><a href=\"http://www.goldenrice.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">&quot;The shocking fact is that, far from reaching the envisaged Millenium Development Goals, more than 10 million children under the age of five are still dying every year.&quot;</a></i></p> </blockquote>  <p>While the WHO show that there is a serious issue, it makes no reference to direct U5 child mortality. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/vad/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/vad/en/</a></p> <p>So what is the implication being made by golden rice. That it is the only solution and that it does more than it claims. </p> <p>If it were to unexpectedly alter the main rice crop this would truly be devastating. while the risk of this might be very small this cannot be completely ruled out from current genetic understanding. It might well be susceptible to different pathogens to traditional rice.</p> <p>But ignoring the above as an acceptable risk you still need to look at how the claims are presented when looking at an alternative take:<br /><a href=\"http://www.gmwatch.org/index.php/news/archive/2013/15023-golden-rice-myths\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br />http://www.gmwatch.org/index.php/news/archive/2013/15023-golden-rice-myths</a></p> <p>The short-term risk is that this is viewed as having solved a problem which has not yet been solved and could easily be solved by sufficient Western intervention but poverty and the underlying problems of the 3rd world will still remain.</p> <p>The only thing which might change is that the more controversial side to GM is allowed to continue unchallenged by governments as the difference between lab science and technology is lost.</p> <p>At the moment people are being allowed to do GM experiments in their garages.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T16:47:21.803+01:00\">at 4.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-525be120e4b0daf4692ecf77\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T13:24:29.433+01:00\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The GM issue raised its head again <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/01/anti-gm-activists-wheat-rothamsted\">in Britain in 2012 </a>when activists threatened to sabotage the Rothamsted Research centre in Hertfordshire.

It is anti-human and immoral for the anti-GM lobby to block golden rice on the back of their own superstitions.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>The Science Media Centre have emailed in some statements from scientists.</p> <p>Professor Mark Tester, Centre for Desert Agriculture, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> “It is heartening to see that there is a prominent government minister with the bravery and leadership to decry the misguided stance of the anti-GM extremists. Campaigners claim that there are more effective solutions to vitamin A deficiency - but what are these solutions, and why have they not yet materialised to beat the world’s biggest health issue, that of micronutrient deficiencies? </p> <p>“The use of GM to increase the nutritional value of rice provides a unique opportunity, a potential new tool to tackle Vitamin A deficiency. From what I have heard, the best on offer from the anti–GM brigade is that people should just eat their greens.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Professor Joe Perry, chair of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) GMO Panel said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“It is important to recognise that in this, and in the previous speech Owen Patterson made on GM crops, he stressed the importance of safety based on a proper scientific assessment of the risks. He is definitively <em>not</em> suggesting any diminution or relaxing of regulation. What he seems to be suggesting is that decisions on authorisation need to be based on the outcome of the regulatory safety assessment; not, as at present, on political considerations. I see no reason why such a stance should not be supported. </p> <p>“It is strange that certain organistions on the one hand vilify those that go against the scientific consensus on climate change but simultaneously refuse to accept the overwhelming scientific consensus on GM food safety. Any organisation that supports the ripping up of regulatory trials designed to inform us about food or environmental safety is denying the public the data on which to make an informed decision; this goes against all the principles of transparency.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Professor Denis Murphy, head of the Genomics and Computational Biology Research Group at the University of South Wales said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“Golden rice was developed 20 years ago by a Swiss-German group of university researchers and it is now being trialled in The Philippines at the International Rice Research institute – a public crop improvement organisation funded by charities. Golden rice is aimed at poor farmers &amp; their families in Asia where vitamin A deficiency is relatively common. It is not a commercial venture and is not owned by Western multinationals like Monsanto or Bayer. There is much public support for golden rice in Asia but unfortunately some western NGOs have recently influenced local activists to destroy some of the field trials in The Philippines, which is very regrettable.</p> <p>“Interestingly, another form of improved rice called NERICA was developed recently in west Africa by highly artificial cell culture and embryo rescue methods. This produced an unnatural hybrid of two different species that is now feeding millions of poor farmers in West Africa. For some reason there has been no outcry about NERICA despite its unnatural origins whereas golden rice has been stigmatised simply due to its GM origins.</p> <p>“It seems that many critics of golden rice fail to understand that much of modern breeding is very artificial and technology dependent – but without it we would certainly be facing famine on a global scale.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Lobby organisation Allow Golden Rice Now, started by Patrick Moore (a former leader of Greenpeace) have said opposition to golden rice could be characterised as a <a href=\"http://www.allowgoldenricenow.org/crimes-against-humanity\">crime against humanity</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are calling on the countries that are Party to the Rome Protocol to investigate this situation with an eye to taking Greenpeace before the International Criminal Court to answer for their crime against humanity.</p> </blockquote> <p> Interestingly, they make a comment that seems to agree with the &apos;trojan horse&apos; argument that golden rice will beget further GM technologies. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We believe Greenpeace&apos;s opposition to Golden Rice is a position held to justify its zero-tolerance approach to genetic modification in general. Greenpeace knows that if there is one good Genetically Modified (GM) variety, there will be others. The organisation would then need to have a rational discussion about the merits of each variety. Instead, it prefers to stand on high in judgment, even though this condemns millions to needless suffering and death.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.goldenrice.org/\">Golden Rice Project</a>, one of the guiding organisations of the golden rice development has added to the comments below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27924241\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10132098\" title=\"View goldenricedotorg’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for goldenricedotorg\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/10132098\" title=\"View goldenricedotorg’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">goldenricedotorg</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/27924241\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">14 October 2013 12:55pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Owen Paterson is absolutely correct! </p> <p>There has been much misinformation and misunderstanding about Golden<br />Rice. Golden Rice is being developed as an additional intervention for vitamin A deficiency, not a replacement one. But as white rice is not a source of vitamin A, and as about 3.5 billion people get more than 80-90% of their calories from rice daily, the potential for alleviation of this particular micronutrient deficiency is huge. </p> <p>Everyone agrees that an end to poverty, and a diverse diet are the best solutions to micronutrient malnutrition. Regrettably, despite all the existing interventions vitamin A deficiency today kills more people than HIV, or TB or Malaria, and is the leading cause of blindness globally. The deficiency kills about 6000 people a day mostly children under 5 years old, and mothers. </p> <p>This is a huge number, and represents a lot of human misery. To put that into context, and with no disrespect to those involved - it's 2x 9/11, and the same number that died in the Pearl Harbour attack which brought the US into WWII. </p> <p>The reason vitamin A deficiency kills so many, is that absence of vitamin A stops the human body from being able to withstand disease. The inventors, who are still closely involved with the strategic management of their project, aim to make the Golden Rice technology a public good, free of any cost or licence fees, available only in public-sector rice germplasm, and developed only by public-sector institutions. There will be no charge for the nutritional trait within the seed to smallholder farmers who sell locally (most rice is consumed close to where it is grown). No individual or organisation involved with the development of Golden Rice will benefit financially from its adoption. </p> <p>Please visit www.goldenrice.org for more information.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T17:37:52.899+01:00\">at 5.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-525bd712e4b0885bd26bedd5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T12:38:56.140+01:00\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Five minute debate</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For some more background on the GM issue, and how adversarial it can be, this short debate between Green party leader Natalie Bennett and Johnjoe McFadden, a professor of molecular genetics at the University of Surrey is worth a watch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2013/aug/06/gm-food-video-debate\"                                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"1945685\"                data-video-name=\"Should we embrace GM food? - five-minute video debate\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/8/2/1375455306911/JohnJoe-McFadden-versus-N-014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-414231709\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/8/2/1375455306911/JohnJoe-McFadden-versus-N-014.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/8/2/130802cifGM-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/8/2/130802cifGM-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/8/2/130802cifGM_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/8/2/130802cifGM/130802cifGM.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/8/2/130802cifGM_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Green party leader&nbsp;Natalie Bennett&nbsp;and&nbsp;Johnjoe McFadden, a professor of molecular genetics at the University of Surrey, debate the future of food production.

The IRRI <a href=\"http://www.irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=10202&amp;Itemid=100571&amp;lang=en\">website</a> says the beta carotene content is unique among rice strains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>According to research published in the <a href=\"http://asn-cdn-remembers.s3.amazonaws.com/1247eb83af3c2c77fb8cf75d5e158f1f.pdf\">American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</a> in 2009, daily consumption of a very modest amount of Golden Rice – about a cup (or around 150 g uncooked weight) – could supply 50% of the Recommended Daily Allowance of vitamin A for an adult.</p> <p>Golden Rice was developed using genetic modification techniques, with genes from maize and a common soil microorganism that together produce beta carotene in the rice grain. Surveys of rice varieties around the world failed to identify any varieties that contain significant amounts of beta carotene, so conventional breeding programs could not be used to develop Golden Rice.</p> <p>Golden Rice was invented by Professor Ingo Potrykus, then of the Institute for Plant Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and Professor Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg, Germany. By 1999, Professor Potrykus and Dr. Beyer produced a prototype Golden Rice and published their landmark research in <em><a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/287/5451/303\">Science</a></em>.</p> <p>The inventors’ desire to donate Golden Rice as a gift to resource-poor farmers in developing countries led to a public-private partnership with Syngenta to help further develop Golden Rice.</p> <p>Scientists at Syngenta then carried out additional laboratory, greenhouse, and field research to help raise the beta carotene levels in Golden Rice. In 2005, they developed a new version of Golden Rice that produces substantially more beta carotene than the 1999 prototype - as published in <em><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n4/full/nbt1082.html\">Nature Biotechnology</a></em>.</p> <p>Syngenta arranged royalty-free access to the patents and intellectual property, held by several biotechnology companies, for a number of key technologies used in Golden Rice. This allows IRRI and others to develop Golden Rice varieties on a non-profit basis.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/about/greenpeace-golden-rice-and-vitamin-deficiency\">Greenpeace has been critical</a> of the technology since its inception. Their website argues that it has diverted resources and interest away from more realistic, sustainable development solutions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While golden GM rice promised a lot, it has so far delivered absolutely nothing after over 10 years of expensive research.</p> <p>All the hype has come at a price, because there are alternative ways to tackle vitamin A deficiency and they&apos;ve been undermined by the focus on a silver bullet technology that does not tackle the underlying social and economic drivers behind vitamin A deficiency.</p> </blockquote> <p>Other arguments advanced against golden rice include concerns it will promote an industrial monoculture and undermine small scale farming which provides for varied diets.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;GE rice could, if introduced on a large scale, exacerbate malnutrition and undermine food security because it encourages a diet based on a single industrial staple food rather than upon the re-introduction of the many vitamin-rich food plants with high nutritional value that are cheap and already available,&quot; says Professor Klaus Becker, from University of Hohenheim, Germany.</p> </blockquote> <p>The other major concern raised about golden rice is that it will somehow soften the ground for large scale acceptance of GM crops. These technologies may not be so philanthropic or open-source as golden rice. Sarojeni Rengam, executive director of Pesticide Action Network Asia, <a href=\"http://www.panna.org/blog/golden-rice-or-trojan-horse\">has said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&quot;Golden Rice is really a ‘Trojan horse’; a public relations stunt pulled by the agribusiness corporations to garner acceptance of GE crops and food. The whole idea of GE seeds is to make money.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>George Monbiot wrote with similar sentiments <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2004/03/09/seeds-of-distraction/\">in 2004</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The world has a surplus of food, but still people go hungry. They go hungry because they cannot afford to buy it. They cannot afford to buy it because the sources of wealth and the means of production have been captured and in some cases monopolised by landowners and corporations. The purpose of the biotech industry is to capture and monopolise the sources of wealth and the means of production.</p> <p>Now in some places governments or unselfish private researchers are producing GM crops which are free from patents and not dependent on the application of proprietary pesticides, and these could well be of benefit to small farmers in the developing world. But Taverne and the other propagandists are seeking to persuade us to approve a corporate model of GM development in the rich world, in the hope that this will somehow encourage the opposite model to develop in the poor world.</p> <p>The biotech companies are not interested in whether or not science is flourishing or people are starving. They simply want to make money. The best way to make money is to control the market. But before you can control the market, you must first convince the people that there’s something else at stake.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T12:51:01.372+01:00\">at 12.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-525bb98ae4b0d2382acc06b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T12:02:12.779+01:00\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to the eco audit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>UK environment secretary Owen Paterson has continued his recent rhetorical campaign to inflame environmentalists by suggesting in an <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/opponents-of-third-world-gm-crops-are-wicked-says-environment-secretary-owen-paterson-8877634.html\">interview with the Independent</a> that opposition to genetically modified crops designed to feed the developing world is &quot;wicked&quot;. But while his recent comments about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/09/badgers-moving-goalposts-owen-paterson-cull\">goalpost-moving badgers </a>and the positive aspects of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/30/owen-paterson-minister-climate-change-advantages\">climate change </a>raised almost unanimous ire from both the environment movement and the science community, his latest criticisms raise an issue that finds green groups and some scientists divided.</p> <p>Golden rice has been touted for more than a decade as a potential cure for vitamin A deficiency (VAD).

Even if you remember it, treat yourself to a re-watch. There is something almost beautiful about how bad it is.</p><p>Concerned that stereotypical images of science were putting girls off studying the subject, the video wanted to show science in a female light. But they simply replaced one set of stereotypes about science with a few more, and added a few painful ones on gender for good measure too. It obscures the detail of actual science with some sort of pink haze and objectifies female scientists to boot.</p><h2>The thinking man's crumpet</h2><p>There's a long history of problematic images of women in science (indeed, of women as experts in general), often emphasising a woman's domestic life above her professional accomplishments. As Dorothy Nelkin notes in her 1995 book Selling Science, Nobel prizewinners Maria Mayer and Barbara McClintock were described in press coverage as, respectively, \"a tiny, shy, touchingly devoted wife and mother\" and \"well known for baking with black walnuts\".</p><p>We might we live in more enlightened times. But according to <a href=\"http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/jomec/research/researchgroups/riskscienceandhealth/fundedprojects/womenscientists.html\">research undertaken in Cardiff</a>, modern media images of women in science may be less detracted by their domestic life, but seem to focus on their appearance instead. So you get lines like \"she may be Britain's leading authority on the brain, but it is her physique that turns heads\". Or \"she looks like an off-duty Bond girl, but she's actually a physicist. Given the chance, plenty of viewers would happily experiment with her.\"</p><p>Such references might seem fairly innocuous – even playfully subverting masculine ideas of science – especially when located within a generally positive article. However, the Cardiff researchers note that while women might be described as having a \"mane of blonde hair\", a piece about a man is more likely to say, \"his full white beard is worn more in homage to Charles Darwin than the Almighty\". Very different connotations.</p><p>They also draw attention to the different places women are used in science coverage. One publicity officer for a major science organisation it interviewed explained that if it were dealing with a \"real heavy-weight current affairs programme\" it would go with a white middle-class male, where as BBC breakfast shows would ask specifically for a young, attractive woman. Another of its research subjects reported that she had trouble moving from kids' television, where her tomboy image fitted fine, to adult programming, because she couldn't suit an image of \"thinking man's crumpet\".</p><p>Overall, the research suggests that men signal an aura of gravitas in science, while women are used when the science is being made \"accessible\" or \"sexy\"; scientifically flavoured \"eye-candy\".</p><h2>Fixing the \"leaky pipe\"</h2><p>The focus on role models reflects one of the key ways of looking at issues of science and gender: as an input problem. An alternative take is to consider issues within science itself, in particular reasons why women might not stay on in careers. This is sometimes described as a \"leaky pipe\" because you can stuff as many new recruits into science as you like, but you need to retain them.</p><p>Ceci and Williams's 2011 paper on <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/02/02/1014871108.full.pdf\">causes of women's underrepresentation in science (pdf)</a> is a clear example of one focusing on the leakiness of the science pipe. Drawing on 20 years of US data on women in the sciences, they conclude women are more likely than men to make personal choices – many of which may well be constrained – that prevent them from progressing to more senior levels. For example, taking time off to raise children, following a spouse, caring for parents.</p><p>This is a problem in many jobs, but a particular one in much of science as you are expected to work especially long hours, often on short-term contracts, with a lot of travel at a point in life where women are most likely to want to take some time off. Post docs in some fields are often expected to clock up several continents before they're 35, and be unquestionably grateful for the opportunity.</p><p>There's also the issues of drinking culture, or at least social activities which women might feel either culturally uncomfortable in, or simply unable to devote the time to (or even outright unwelcome at). One of the things I've noticed from running social media training for postdocs is that mothers hope this will be a chance for them to engage in the everyday social interactions around science which they miss because they don't want to leave children to attend conferences; things like the '<a href=\"http://io9.com/5974256/overlyhonestmethods-is-the-postsecret-of-the-science-world-and-it-is-amazing\">overly honest methods'</a> tag which offer information and guidance, not just jokes and bonding. There's a telling reference to the role of shooting days in a Cranfield School of Management <a href=\"http://www.som.cranfield.ac.uk/som/dinamic-content/media/Transforming%20Boardroom%20Cultures.pdf\">report on women in science and boardroom culture (pdf)</a>. In terms of social interaction within work itself, Platform's Kevin Smith offers <a href=\"http://platformlondon.org/2013/03/22/those-icky-meetings-where-males-largely-talk-to-the-other-males-present/\">some revealing notes (and useful practical tips)</a> about the experience of being in meetings with expert female colleagues and yet finding the men defer to other men.</p><p>Many men suffer because of the various social structures of science and other work too. It's not just an example of how science excludes women, it's a warning of a larger pathology in the way we do science.</p><h2>Global picture</h2><p>Let's take a step back at this point and consider the global picture. According to Unesco data, overall women account for a minority of the world's researchers, but it's not a tiny minority and varies a lot from place to place. The Atlantic did <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/a-map-of-the-gender-gap-in-science-around-the-globe/280407/\">a nice introduction to one of its figures</a> last week.</p><p>To pull out a few examples from its <a href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/ScienceTechnology/Documents/sti-women-in-science-en.pdf\">2012 factsheet (pdf)</a>, the UK is around the middle of Europe, with 37.9% female researchers, with Latvia at 52.4% and Luxembourg has 21.2%. France, the Netherlands and Germany aren't far ahead though, all under 27%. In terms of the Americas, Bolivia is at 63.2% with several others still over 50%. With Asia, it runs from 85.5% in Burma to 1.4% in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>These sorts of audits can be very useful, helping us find new questions to ask about interesting trends, and data gathering of this sort is increasingly undertaken at national and more local levels. But it's important to remember that the global picture means dealing with many different types of gender and scientific contexts.</p><p>Campion and Schrum's 2004 work on women scientists in Ghana, Kenya and India argues that a combination of issues restrict the professional networks for women, and suggest work aiming for greater gender equality should focus on increasing social rather than material resources. There was also an interesting point made by <a href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Pages/women-higher-education.aspx\">UN data analyst Chiao-Ling Chien</a>, on how women in the formerly communist countries have a 40-year advantage on many others. Or, I was a bit puzzled by Burma, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beck_smith\">Beck Smith</a> offered <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/publication/myanmar?print\">information from the International Food Policy Research Institute</a> and suggested it could be due to science's low pay and low skills threshold. If you are going to compare countries on gender and science issues, you have to understand how and why the questions and possible answers might vary globally.</p><p>The main message from this is not just gender, but how gender becomes an issue in a range of different social contexts. Understanding the granular detail of these issues will also be a matter of how gender intersects with other forms of oppression (yes, that is that thing people call <a href=\"http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Intersectionality\">\"intersectionality\"</a>). So let's talk about race and class and a few other things, too. Because then we can learn more about how oppression works.</p><h2>Facing the whiteness of science</h2><p>One of the many outcomes of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence\">Lawrence inquiry</a> was a greater awareness in the UK that simply thinking you were against racism didn't actually mean you were anti-racist. Institutions and individuals had to check themselves more thoroughly for unwitting and thoughtless acts of racism in structures and attitudes which have become normalised. To put this in a science context, I can recommend <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/urban-scientist/2013/01/24/a-dream-deferred-how-access-to-stem-is-denied-to-many-students-before-they-get-in-the-door-good/\">DN Lee's great post last January</a> discussing why she is unapologetically a female, black, urban scientist, and exposing ways in which a scientific career is denied to many before they get in the door of a university. </p><p>In discussing race and education, David Gillborn invites us to push ideas of unwitting racism further, advocating an approach informed by critical race theory. This sees racism as an endemic part of society, deeply engrained legally and culturally, which means it tends to look normal. Formal equal opportunity projects can remedy extreme forms of injustice but do little to deal with the business-as-usual forms of oppression. Claims to objectivity and '<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment\">meritocracy'</a> act as camouflages for in equality.</p><p>Applying a critical race approach means trying to notice these more embedded forms of injustice and questioning them. A lot of the time it means noticing whiteness which, unlike colour, can go unnoticed and unquestioned as the norm.</p><p>We can say the same of many other forms of privilege, be it in terms of gender, disability, sexuality, class or more. Notice what the norm is and ask whether things might be improved if we diversified from that simple point of view. When someone invites you to check your privilege, it can feel like a challenge, but it is also an invitation to learn; to simply see yourself, and possibly develop in the process. It isn't necessarily an attempt to take something from you.</p><p>Importantly in terms of thinking about science, Gillborn refers to accounts of sometimes heated exchanges when the implicit supremacy of whiteness is challenged in universities. He suggests this highlights how ideas of validity, objectivity and authority have been constructed in highly racialised ways, and that academics still find this hard to acknowledge. This point was made very well in <a href=\"http://tressiemc.com/2013/10/13/academic-whores/\">a recent post</a> from sociology PhD student Tressie McMillan Cottom, responding to DN Lee being called an \"urban whore\":</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Many academics consider research that examines the experiences of racial and ethnic minorities as unscientific and less rigorous than research that focuses on politics, war, philosophy, the Higgs particle and the like. Even when that research intersects with the experiences of minorities with politics, war, philosophy or natural science it is often considered a pet interest with little relevance to real science.</p></blockquote><p>Gillborn gives an example of a black student in one of his classes angrily exclaiming \"don't you believe me\" to another student after giving witness to her own experience of racism. This anger at not being trusted as an authority is an experience many women in science will be familiar with too, and many working class people, many disabled people, many others. It's one of the reasons it is so annoying that, useful as the term mansplaining can be, the 'man' focuses on gender. It <a href=\"http://alicerosebell.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/modernity-can-be-hard-work-on-mansplaining/\">isn't simply something men do to women</a>, and most corrosive when it goes unnoticed. On a similar theme, I can recommend <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/tom-leonard-the-six-o-clock-news/10301.html \">Tom Leonard's poem The Six O'Clock News</a>, in particular the points he makes about our ideas of \"trooth\" in relation to the use of a regional accent.</p><p>Asking science to question the assumptions it makes about rigor, rationality and authority can be difficult, but we need to recognise white dominance of science just as we need to face up to implicit patriarchy and address it as a possibly distorting factor. If science really wants to claim to aim for objectivity, it needs to look at itself.</p><h2>Science and social mobility</h2><p>In the UK in particular, science has a reputation for being relatively accessible to working class students. Science and engineering, compared to subjects where you were expected to have the social or cultural capital of a middle class family to progress in, are traditionally seen as places a student could succeed in with simple hard graft. Long gone are they days of the \"gentleman scientist\" who studied nature as a hobby, funded by independent wealth. Now they are professionalised and paid, a contrast to the humanities where many PhDs are self-funded. </p><p>Science and engineering are also often sold as a route to \"social mobility\", a way of stepping up a metaphorical class ladder. And yet, science is becoming an increasingly exclusive endeavour in itself, be it tutors to help schoolchildren through exams, if your school <a href=\"http://sciencecampaign.org.uk/?p=7009\">can offer triple GCSE science or not</a>, or access to university more generally. The basis of a scientific career is at least one degree, if not three or four and will always be elite as long as higher education is. </p><p>It was also interesting to see science and technology playing a part in Savage et al's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/21970879\">recent expansion of the vocabularies of class</a> (the BBC class calculator thing) with their new category of the \"technical middle\". They describe this as small, but relatively prosperous. It contains an over-representation of those doing research, scientific and technical forms of work, and an over-representation of people with degrees from established and prestigious universities with reputations for science like Warwick, UCL, Imperial, or Cambridge, with a slight over-representation of graduates in science and technology.</p><p>Importantly, they are socially and culturally restricted – going against the idea that more disadvantaged people have low numbers of social contacts – although the relationships they do have tend to be of high status. Geographically, they are largely in the south-east of England, but \"shun the centre of London and tend to be located in suburban locations (perhaps consistent with their social isolation)\".</p><p>They also note that it has an above average number of women, and that they are surprised by that. It surprised me too, but I'm not sure it is good news. Is this socially excluded and exclusive group what we want as a success story for women in science?</p><p>I started with a video showing a truly awful attempt to deal with diversity in science, but I want to end with something better. This film by Nathan E Richards exploring the absence of black professors in UK higher education institutions is an excellent discussion of race in academia but also the politics of knowledge more generally. Very much worth your time.</p><p><br /><em>Alice Bell is a research fellow at the Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex.

Mobile learning might be one way we can support young mothers when school interruptions occur due to early pregnancy. Here are some of my thoughts which draw upon the Kenyan context.</p><h2>Schooling and early pregnancy in Kenya</h2><p>With a <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/13/69\" title=\"\">high rate</a> of early pregnancies among women in Kenya, female children in both primary and secondary school are increasingly being affected. One of the most damaging side effects of this phenomenon in Kenya is that once pregnant, many girls face barriers such as a lack of awareness among school administrators about laws on early pregnancy and schooling, severe time constraints due to care work, and even familial beliefs that deny them the right to continue their education.</p><p>Recently, speaking on <a href=\"http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000092701&amp;story_title=give-pregnant-girls-a-chance-says-kaimenyi\" title=\"\">education reform</a>, cabinet secretary for education, science and technology in Kenya Jacob Kaimenyi drew attention to the difficulties that girls face when they want to return to school after having a baby. Although there is no policy in place that restricts a girl's ability to rejoin her peers in school, many girls <a href=\"http://www.worldywca.org/YWCA-News/World-YWCA-and-Member-Associations-News/Empowering-Adolescent-Girls-and-Teenage-Mothers-in-Kenya\" title=\"\">drop out</a> or are sent home when the pregnancy is discovered, are <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org/2011/11/sub-saharan-girls-held-back-child-marriage-and-violence\" title=\"\">turned away</a> when they try to return to school after giving birth, or are refused the chance to try and return because of <a href=\"http://plan-international.org/where-we-work/africa/kenya/about-plan/news/society-cultural-prejudices-a-key-barrier-to-continued-education-among-pregnant-teen-girls2019-in-kilifi-kenya/\" title=\"\">the stigma</a> the pregnancy and subsequent birth places on the girl and her family.</p><p>Commonly there <a href=\"http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/2382\" title=\"\">is a desire by girl learners to continue their education</a>, especially their formal education, despite their pregnancy even when the barriers to returning to school imposed by their families or schools and social stigmas may not easily permit it. Awareness-raising campaigns about the rights of young mothers, such as the girl declaration, can undoubtedly help address issues surrounding access to education by young mothers. Nevertheless, problems persist, and for girls out of reach or otherwise unable to benefit from these mechanisms, mobile phones could offer learning support.</p><p>Despite the <a href=\"http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/07/24/12909129-kenyans-use-cell-phones-for-everything-from-buying-groceries-to-paying-rent?lite\" title=\"\">use of mobiles in a number of facets of Kenyan society</a> (banking, utilities, retail, health, transportation, etc), their use in education remains limited to a few offerings such as <a href=\"http://enezaeducation.com/\" title=\"\">Eneza Education</a> (mostly secondary) and <a href=\"http://e-limu.org/\" title=\"\">eLimu</a> (mostly primary).</p><p>Some of the oft-repeated challenges to mobile learning as a viable vehicle for education include the costs associated with ownership and maintenance of the devices, fears of inappropriate use, and the <a href=\"http://www.ictworks.org/2011/12/09/have-mobile-phones-and-mlearning-failed-education/\" title=\"\">alleged</a> difficulty of reading on the devices with small screens.</p><p>While a <a href=\"http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/kenya-mobile-phones-nigeria-pop-musicians/1671589.html\" title=\"\">study from Kenya</a> indicated that some may go without food to own and maintain a mobile device, the device is often used to improve its owner's life, making the costs spent on its usage long-term investments. Eneza Education and <a href=\"http://www.gmaarifa.com/how_we_do_it.html\" title=\"\">gMaarifa</a> demonstrate that high-end mobile devices and smartphones are not a necessary prerequisite for mobile learning in Kenya, since both organisations' approaches to mobile learning do not require more expensive mobile tools.</p><p>Inappropriate use of mobile devices is a common issue <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/cyberbullying-increases-in-line-with-mobile-phone-usage-infographic/14713\" title=\"\">around the world </a>among youth. Perceived and real problems can range from contacting a member of the opposite sex to cyberbullying. Yet, a knee-jerk reaction to this challenge is to ban youth mobile use altogether. Educating Kenyan girls — and their families — on potential pitfalls and guiding them to use mobile devices appropriately is more sensible, especially when they are likely to find a way to use the devices anyway. But we do not see many mobile learning initiatives globally making this an integral part of their approach, to the detriment of any possible long-term success.</p><p>Helping to dispel the notion that reading on mobiles is difficult, Worldreader <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/ICT/pdf/Worldreader.pdf\" title=\"\">adds evidence</a> that reading in Kenya, even on small feature phones and eReaders, can be enjoyable and beneficial to young learners.</p><p>Education is key for marginalised girls (such as young mothers) to participate in all domains of the societies they live in. If an overarching goal for Kenya is to cultivate a knowledge economy, then more avenues of obtaining this knowledge need to be opened up for young mothers, a group that can <a href=\"http://www.ungei.org/news/247_2165.html\" title=\"\">contribute substantially</a> to development efforts if given access to education.</p><p>Young mothers of school age in Kenya make ideal beneficiaries of mobile learning opportunities when they experience school interruptions because they have a strong need for flexibility when juggling the demands of child rearing, are not always able to attend school even if they are permitted to return, do not always have consistent or affordable access to formal education or computers, may feel embarrassed to return to school after giving birth, and can make use of the mobile literacy skills they gain to pursue income-generating activities, if needed.</p><h2>What subjects can young mothers access through mobile-based instruction?</h2><p>When girls leave school after becoming pregnant or are unable to return after giving birth, the stigma of exclusion compounds their marginalisation. But we are seeing encouraging signs of possible future support in bridging the home-school divide at the primary and secondary level with educational technology. Through mobile devices, we have seen a number of subjects taught including maths (<a href=\"http://drmath.meraka.csir.co.za/drmath/\" title=\"\">Dr Math</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/29/m4girls-pilot-project-uses-nokia-6300-handsets-to-teach-math/\" title=\"\">M4Girls</a>), mother tongue languages (eTaleem, <a href=\"http://www.et4d.com/work/\" title=\"\">MoToLi</a>), science (<a href=\"http://www.text2teach.org.ph/?page_id=2\" title=\"\">Text2Teach</a>), sexual health &amp; HIV/Aids prevention (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2012/dec/05/breaking-sexual-health-taboos-in-nigeria\" title=\"\">education as a vaccine</a>), and life skills (<a href=\"http://www.learningaboutliving.org/south/online\" title=\"\">learning about living</a>).</p><p>For young mothers in Kenya, having support to access education at a distance, in the subjects above, which will be critical to their success as they grow into adults, should be viewed as a right and not a luxury. Mobile learning can be one medium to help realise this right. Nevertheless, even when this approach is undertaken, practitioners and educators must ensure they work to involve the girls' communities in the transformation process. <a href=\"http://plan-international.org\" title=\"\">Plan International</a> has a number of resources for how community involvement in support of girls can be mobilised, including identifying community members who can be girl child champions.  After all, it takes a village to raise a child.</p><p><em>Ronda Zelezny-Green is a member of the </em><a href=\"http://www.ict4d.org.uk/%E2%80%8E\" title=\"\"><em>ICT4D collective at Royal Holloway, University of London</em></a><em>.

Howarth suggested the chiefs might “speculate as to what further safeguards can be put into place” at the hearing.</p> <p>The public hearing would be important although the agency heads would not be able to speak totally freely, he said, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Maybe we need to justify all over again why it is that the state does require that we have secrets. And if you have secrets, who controls, who knows about those secrets. These are big, important questions, and I know they’re ones they’ll grapple with, the heads of the agencies, but we as a democracy, whether we’re parliamentarians on the intelligence and security committee, in the government, or just members of the public, are rightly concerned about [them].</p> </blockquote> <p>Howarth also returned the debate to Snowden’s revelations of government surveillance in the US and UK themselves, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Where is the balance between on the one hand the state’s need to know who’s doing what that might lead to harm to the people who live here … set against the civil liberties of people and the reasonable expectation that their communications aren’t going to be monitored to no useful purpose?</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked his view of where this balance should lie, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we looked at, in terms of the information-sharing that takes place between the National Security Agency [NSA] and GCHQ, our own agency, we found no evidence … of any wrongdoing. They behaved within the law. Authorisations have been properly obtained before any particular information has been accessed.</p> <p>So we start from a position where nobody’s actually breaking the law at the moment. </p> <p>The next question that arises, in terms of reassuring people that their privacy will be properly protected, is: “What safeguards are there in place, legally, to ensure that those communications aren’t tampered with in any way, improperly or in any way unethically?” And we’re at the point now I think where we need to think about that. </p> <p>I haven’t got a particular prescription at this stage. I’ve got an open mind.

He was called back for a third interview with MI5, who had a two-inch thick file on him and his family.</p> <p>Straw was questioned about his sister, Suzy, whom they believed, on the evidence of a neighbour, to be a member of the Communist party. The spook showed Straw a memo from someone who had been spying on his sister. Straw told them it was a mistake. His sister had merely fancied a member of the CP.</p> <p>He was then questioned about leftwing contemporaries while he had been President of the National Union of Students. He was confronted with detailed evidence from someone who had spied on a lunch he and another student had had in a pub years earlier – including a detailed account of their conversations.</p> <p>At the end of the meeting the spook asked Straw not to tell Barbara Castle about their meeting. Straw readily agreed. “On the way back to the DHSS I reflected on the fact that the Security Service had begun to put together this file on my family when I was 15 – and on the scale of the surveillance operation this implied.”</p> <p>Most people might have been troubled by this.

Straw said Guardian journalists’ “almost adolescent excitement” had gone to their heads.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think that the head of the security service, MI5, has been absolutely right to say what he has said, and I regret what I can only describe as indulgent, irresponsibility by the Guardian newspaper. You can always justify everything, if you’re a newspaper, on the grounds that this is open journalism, but this is about much more than journalism, it’s genuinely about how we protect the national interest. And that’s not just about protecting the ‘establishment’, it’s about keeping people safe, it’s about avoiding another 7th of July 2005.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if the revelations have risked lives, Straw said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, potentially. I’m not suggesting for a moment that anybody at the Guardian gratuitously wants to risk anybody’s life. But what I do think is there sense of power of having these ‘secrets’ and excitement, almost adolescent excitement, about these secrets, has gone to their head and they’re blinding themselves about the consequence, and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particularly secrets which they publish are or are not likely to damage the national interest.

I specifically said that one of the things that we’re going to have to discuss and debate is how were we striking this balance between the need to keep the American people safe and our concerns about privacy, because there are some trade-offs involved.</p> <p>And I welcome this debate. And I think it’s healthy for our democracy. I think it’s a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate. And I think it’s interesting that there are some folks on the left, but also some folks on the right who are now worried about it who weren’t very worried about it when it was a Republican president. I think that’s good that we’re having this discussion.</p> <p>But I think it’s important for everybody to understand, and I think the American people understand, that there are some trade-offs involved. You know, I came in with a health skepticism about these programs. My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly. We actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of the safeguards. But my assessment and my team’s assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks. And the modest encroachments on privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and not looking at content — that on, you know, net, it was worth us doing.</p> <p>That’s — some other folks may have a different assessment of that. But I think it’s important to recognize that you can’t have a hundred percent security and also then have a hundred percent privacy and zero inconvenience. You know, we’re going to have to make some choices as a society.</p> <p>And — (audio break) — I can say is, is that in evaluating these programs, they make a difference — (audio break) — to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity. And the fact that they’re under very strict supervision by all three branches of government and that they do not involve listening to people’s phone calls, do not involve reading the emails of U.S. citizens or U.S. residents, absent further action by a federal court, that is entirely consistent with what we would do, for example, in a criminal investigation.</p> <p>I think, on balance, we — you know, we have established a process and a procedure that the American people should feel comfortable about. But again, this — these programs are subject to congressional oversight and congressional reauthorization and congressional debate. And if there are members of Congress who feel differently, then they should speak up.</p> <p>And we’re happy to have that debate.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-11T11:28:18.907+01:00\">at 11.28am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5257c79be4b0f49d54fe28a9\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-11T10:41:51.380+01:00\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleagues in our Sydney office have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/11/nsa-revelations-australian-editors-back-the-guardian\">speaking to the editors of the Australian press</a>, who also back the Guardian&apos;s decision to publish.

But at a deeper level it hints at a profound and alarming complacency about the roles of media and government. Hell, let’s not ask questions at all. Let’s not scrutinise those with the power and ability to carry out widespread surveillance on their own citizens. Let’s keep the public in the dark, rather than serving their right to know.

Osama bin Laden did not need Edward Snowden&apos;s revelations about Prism to realise the US was listening in to every bit of electronic communication: he had already seceded from the world of telephony and reverted to couriers. But millions of people in the US, the UK, Brazil, India and elsewhere, including national leaders, energy companies and others who are being spied upon for base reasons, were unaware of the fact that their privacy was being compromised.</p> </blockquote> <p>Frank Schirrmacher of Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says: “There is no indication whatsoever that those media organisations who reported about the NSA and GCHQ files have endangered our national security.”</p> <p>And Jill Abramson of the New York Times writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The accurate and in-depth news articles published by the New York Times and the Guardian help inform the public in framing its thinking about these issues and deciding how to balance the need to protect against terrorism and to protect individual<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy\"> privacy</a>.

The editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, had earlier informed government officials that other copies of the files existed outside the country and that the Guardian was neither the sole recipient nor steward of the files leaked by Snowden.

He called on the Guardian to &quot;exercise its own accountability&quot; over the stories.</p> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think the house knows that the freedom of speech which we all so highly prize comes with a responsibility and I think the members of the house and the public will have been very struck by what it was that the director-general of MI5 said during the course of this week and I&apos;m sure he was absolutely right to say it.</p> <p>In that context if I may I will ask the home secretary to consider the point you raise and how she might inform the house in due course.

His view is the leaks have damaged national security, but the former director of operations and intelligence of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/mi6-plays-down-damage-edward-snowden-leaks\"> MI6, Nigel Inkster,</a> has been more sceptical. &quot;I sense that those most interested in the activities of the NSA and GCHQ have not been told much they didn&apos;t already know or could have inferred.&quot;</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/06/11/in-nsa-leak-case-a-whistle-blower-or-a-criminal/before-prosecuting-snowden-investigate-the-government\">In an opinion piece for the New York Times</a>, the security specialist Bruce Schneier said the argument about compromising national security &quot;doesn&apos;t even pass the laugh test&quot;.</p> <p>Last week,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html?pagewanted=all\"> the New York Times reported</a> Snowden&apos;s disclosures had caused less damage than another self-inflicted leak. Apparently, there has been a &quot;sharp drop in terrorists&apos; use of a major communications channel&quot; after the US press revealed American spies had intercepted messages between two senior al-Qaida commanders in the Middle East.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/defence-and-security-blog/2013/oct/09/gchq-mi5-accountability\">On his blog</a>, Richard Norton-Taylor, the Guardian’s former defence and security editor, argues that “what GCHQ needs – and MI5 and MI6 – is more effective and credible accountability”.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even serving intelligence chiefs admit privately that the system of Commissioners – normally former senior judges – set up to monitor the activities of the security and intelligence agencies is weak and lacks credibilty.</p> <p>The prime minister-appointed parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee has yet to show itself to be a credible, independent, oversight body.</p> <p>The value of a truly independent inspector was demonstrated the day after Parker delivered his speech.The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, published a detailed report, warts and all, (though with some passages redacted) about the Home Office&apos;s flagship &quot;e-borders&quot;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/09/e-borders-scheme-failing-to-stop-terror-suspects\"> programme</a>.</p> <p>In the end, as I have argued before, it is a matter of trust. Legislation helps but it will not always be able to catch up with the development of intrusive technology.</p> <p>A system of credible, full-time, independent inspectors would help.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the comment pages, John Kampfner, the former chief executive of Index on Censorship, attempts to explain the &quot;silence and sneers&quot; from rival newspapers that have greeted the Guardian&apos;s Snowden revelations: &quot;Leveson&quot;. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most rivals on Fleet Street think this paper has also been selective in its embrace of freedom of expression, siding as it did with advocates of greater regulation of the British press. This is payback time.</p> <p>With so much at stake, one might reasonably (or naively) assume that, whatever their political hue, the media might work collaboratively in challenging the powerful. For as long as the press fails in its core function and for as long as our parliamentarians remain quiescent, the security services can act as they please, accumulating information on all of us they could never have dreamed of.</p> <p>At one point in his speech, Parker asserts: &quot;I too believe strongly that the public is owed an explanation of the threats the country faces and what we are doing about them.&quot; How right he is.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52568755e4b068418f428165\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-10T11:56:18.928+01:00\">11.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greenwald and Miranda address Brazilian senate</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p data-component=\"Video:standfirst_cta\">Yesterday Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who has been most involved with the Snowden revelations, and David Miranda, his partner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/oct/09/brazil-glenn-greenwald-war-against-journalism-senate-video\">spoke to the senate in Brazil</a>, where they live, about the story.

Here are the full quotes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Q: Do you agree with<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/debate-grows-orwellian-nsa-technology\"> the prime minister who [supports Andrew Parker&apos;s warning that] the Guardian&apos;s publication of those files handed the advantage to Britain&apos;s enemies,</a> it was a guidebook to terrorism, the Edward Snowden story.</p> <p>NC: I certainly agree that if what you end up doing is just basically publishing very technical information that actually most Guardian readers, or most of us, would not frankly understand but the only people who will understand are the technicians amongst the terrorists, then what&apos;s the public interest in that?</p> <p>However, I think of course there&apos;s a totally legitimate debate to be had about - and my experience speaking to people in the intelligence agencies is that they recognise this - the use of these new, incredibly powerful technologies. We have legislation, regulations, which were designed for an age which is quite different now. And both terrorists and states, and security agencies, now conduct this battle online in a way that was unimaginable a few years ago. And what they means for privacy and proportionality is a totally legitimate area of debate.</p> <p>How you hold the secret parts of any part of any state to account is an incredibly important issue. Because secrecy is necessary, of course it is. You absolutely must defend the principle of secrecy for the intelligence agencies, without which they can&apos;t keep us safe.</p> <p>But you can only really make secrecy legitimate in the eyes of the public if there is proper form of accountability.</p> <p>Now, we&apos;ve improved it. This government has taken big steps - and I&apos;m delighted that we&apos;ve done this - to strengthen, for instance, the intelligence and security committee, which is the committee which holds the agencies to account in parliament. But I saw a previous head of MI5 say recently to expect the public just to accept that some slightly opaque arrangement in Westminster is the way to hold everyone to account, in which the public does not have much of an insight - I think it&apos;s right for us to ask whether there anything more we can do to make sure the public feel that accountability is working in this area properly.</p> <p>Q: But did the Guardian go to far with the level of detail it published?</p> <p>NC: Oh, I&apos;ve got no doubt that there were some parts of what was published which will have passed most readers of the Guardian completely by, because they were very technical, but will have been of immense interest to people who want to do us harm.</p> <p>Q: So it should not have put it out there?</p> <p>NC: As I said, I think it&apos;s a totally legitimate debate, about the power of these technologies, about how you get the balance right, how you make sure these technologies are used in a proportionate and accountable way, but I don&apos;t think just giving technical secrets, if I can put it that way, to people who want to do us harm, serves any purpose.</p> </blockquote> <p>Theresa May’s view was closer to that of Parker – and that expressed by David Cameron’s spokesman yesterday. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I agree with Andrew Parker. I think it is difficult when you have revelations about how security operates, then that does cause a problem – it can give some comfort to terrorists. And he was very clear about the statement that he made, and I think we need to be very clear about the need to ensure that we have the security arrangements in place that enable us to continue to protect the British public.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525681c0e4b068418f428162\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-10T11:39:06.023+01:00\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Thursday 10 October 2013: Snowden's father in Moscow</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\">Edward Snowden</a>&apos;s father landed in Moscow on Thursday morning and said he hoped to visit his son, who has not been seen in public since he was granted asylum in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> in August.</p> <p>&quot;I am his father, I love my son and ...

The spooks are not interested in building great haystacks of information; they are after the needles. In the search for those needles, however, they should not be permitted random walks through our privacy. The instinct of intelligence agencies is to push the boundaries. The role of politicians and the press is to test them in the search for balance between security and liberty.</p> </blockquote> <p>The boundaries of GCHQ&apos;s work is one of the key talking points. In his speech MI5 director general Andrew Parker said:<a href=\"https://www.mi5.gov.uk/home/about-us/who-we-are/staff-and-management/director-general/speeches-by-the-director-general/director-generals-speech-at-rusi-2013.html\"> &quot;It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques.&quot;</a></p> <p>Stephens said their should be a balance between public oversight of the security services and trust in its activities.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The further they reach, the more intelligence agencies will have to provide more information about the what and why of their operations.

That’s because we are working slowly and responsibly. As we discover further stories that we think merit the debate – the debate that everyone says is necessary – then we will go on publishing. </p> </blockquote> <p>Rusbridger said last night’s speech by MI5 director general Sir Andrew Parker was &quot;perfectly reasonable and what you would expect him to say&quot;.</p> <p>He added: “If you are on the security side of the argument you want to keep everything secret, you don’t want a debate and you don’t want the press writing about it. But MI5 cannot be the only voice in this debate.”</p> <p>The Guardian editor insisted the paper&apos;s revelations were in the public interest.</p> <p>&quot;What is significantly new about what we have been revealing is the extent to which entire populations are now being potentially put under surveillance,&quot; he said.</p> <p>Rusbridger added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There a difference between harvesting and targeting. But is pretty plain they are harvesting a very great deal, and their ambition is to master the internet and scoop the entire lot up and to save it for as long as possible. They says that’s the haystack and they will then look for needles in extremely controlled circumstances.</p> <p>The question is who gets the oversight of that. Chris Huhne [the former cabinet minister] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/prism-tempora-cabinet-surveillance-state#comment-27692054\">has said</a> these vast new programmes weren’t discussed at the National Security Council [and] weren’t discussed at cabinet.</p> <p>There has to be wider debate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked whether newspaper editors should be the arbiters of what is revealed, Rusbridger said only a handful of MPs were willing to speak out on the issue. He said: “If parliament is not going to have this discussion and if the courts can only discuss this in private, then absolutely it falls to the press to stimulate a discussion, which throughout America, throughout Europe, is one that the public is intensely interested in.”</p> <p>Intelligence chiefs have always maintained that disclosing their tactics is a gift to terrorists, Rusbridger pointed out. But he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has to be a balance ... These technologies are formidable. They are beyond what Orwell could have imagined.</p> <p>It may that everything in a social democracy is fine at the moment and that oversight is working. But I would be very surprised if the current oversight methods really understood and knew about some of the things that we have been describing as a result of the Snowden revelations.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-31c86605-7c10-40c4-901f-d96d65a1df58\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/9/1381323419542/f02c4976-a61d-4e24-8972-1deea8fcacd5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Guardian Editor Alan Rusbridger\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger.

Hopkins writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In recent days, a former head of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, acknowledged her old agency needed to be more transparent.</p> <p>A former head of America&apos;s National Security Agency, General Michael Hayden, said much the same thing. Last week he told an audience in London: &quot;It&apos;s clear to me now that in liberal democracies the security services don&apos;t get to do what they do without broad public understanding and support. And although the public cannot be briefed on everything, there has to be enough out there so that the majority of the population believe what they are doing is acceptable.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Hopkins also points out that there are those who doubt Parker&apos;s assertion that publishing information such as that leaked by Edward Snowden handed a &quot;gift&quot; to terrorists.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Three weeks ago, Nigel Inkster, former deputy chief of MI6, played down the potential damage. &quot;I sense that those most interested in the activities of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa\">NSA</a>and GCHQ have not been told much they didn&apos;t already know or could have inferred,&quot; he said.</p> <p>In an opinion piece for the New York Times, the security specialist Bruce Schneier said: &quot;The argument that exposing these documents helps the terrorists doesn&apos;t even pass the laugh test; there&apos;s nothing here that changes anything any potential terrorist would do or not do.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>But he points out that neither Parker, nor those who doubt has claim, can prove their point. The same is true, he says, for the claim foreign intelligence agencies may now have access to Snowden&apos;s documents.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Perhaps the Russians and the Chinese do now have the files. But if they have obtained them, they have managed a feat that has so far eluded the combined efforts of the British and American intelligence communities.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5255319ee4b0f6451e9a7fbb\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-09T11:55:11.647+01:00\">11.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greenwald's response</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who has had the most contact with Snowden, has balked at the treatment of Parker&apos;s speech by sections of the British press.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/387884089153302528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>How unusual: a top UK national security official screams &quot;The Terrorists!!&quot; over &amp; over to justify govt&#39;s actions <a href=\"http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY\">http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY</a></p>&mdash; Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/387884089153302528\">October 9, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/387885598616203264\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>To a right-wing paper, it&#39;s apparently heinous to publish even after the Government orders you not to  <a href=\"http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY\">http://t.co/C7UxzuDYAY</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PressServants&amp;src=hash\">#PressServants</a></p>&mdash; Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/387885598616203264\">October 9, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Greenwald doesn&apos;t buy MI5&apos;s anti-terror spin and questions why GCHQ are involved in spying on Brazilian government departments, <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.petrobras.com%2F&amp;ei=mapOUoqECaSM7QbOlYHoDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE_M17wi07hoxbWwe7BjY2zYxBdMQ&amp;sig2=2ap1_n96xoCfxgWZE465cA&amp;bvm=bv.53537100,d.ZGU\">Petrobras</a> the oil company that funds social programmes in Brazil, and the US peace campaign the Organization of American States.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/statuses/387884279566315520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Could the MI5 chief please identify the Al Qaeda elements at the OAS, Petrobras &amp; Ministry of Mines and Energy?

You have to have the rules set up so you can defend Wall Street.</p> </blockquote> <p>FP’s Shane Harris reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Drawing an analogy to how the military detects an incoming missile with radar and other sensors, Alexander imagined the NSA being able to spot &quot;a cyberpacket that&apos;s about to destroy Wall Street.&quot; In an ideal world, he said, the agency would be getting real-time information from the banks themselves, as well as from the NSA&apos;s traditional channels of intelligence, and have the power to take action before a cyberattack caused major damage.</p> </blockquote> <p>Harris comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The analogy was a stretch. For starters, what&apos;s a &quot;cyberpacket&quot;? Presumably Alexander meant a sophisticated computer worm or virus designed to disrupt a computer or destroy the data inside it. (Maybe like the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet\"> one</a> his agency reportedly helped design to destroy centrifuges in an Iranian nuclear facility.) But the idea that a single, tiny packet could wipe out Wall Street is laughable. That&apos;s like saying a paintball can take out a tank.</p> </blockquote> <p>Harris reports that Alexander acknowledged the NSA had lost some public trust since the Snowden revelations, but he called the press’s accounts of these “sensationalised”.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Alexander said he is open to some modifications of existing surveillance programs, particularly one that collects all telephone records in the United States and stores them at the NSA for up to five years. Alexander said he would be comfortable storing the data somewhere else or requiring more reports on how the data is used, but that the NSA&apos;s surveillance work should not end. &quot;I think the authorities should stay intact,&quot; he said. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-09T10:50:55.950+01:00\">at 10.50am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52551f59e4b0c3ba32d00fce\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-09T10:26:53.438+01:00\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Press releases?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Freedom of information campaigner, Heather Brooke, questions the uncritical handling of Parker&apos;s speech by much of the British press.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/newsbrooke/statuses/387834424832049152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>It amazes me people think the British press are &#39;feral&#39;.

During the cold war that meant defending domestic systems while attacking Soviet ones.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But with the rise of mass-market computing and the internet, the two missions have become <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/05/dualuse_technol_1.html\">interwoven</a>. It becomes increasingly difficult to attack their systems and defend our systems, because everything is using the same systems: Microsoft Windows, Cisco routers, HTML, TCP/IP, iPhones, Intel chips, and so on. Finding a vulnerability – or creating one – and keeping it secret to attack the bad guys necessarily leaves the good guys more vulnerable.</p> <p>Far better would be for the NSA to take those vulnerabilities back to the vendors to patch. Yes, it would make it harder to eavesdrop on the bad guys, but it would make everyone on the internet safer. If we believe in protecting our critical infrastructure from foreign attack, if we believe in protecting internet users from repressive regimes worldwide, and if we believe in defending businesses and ourselves from cybercrime, then doing otherwise is lunacy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-524e9041e4b0b103eb47f3df\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-04T16:25:20.652+01:00\">4.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German intelligence service 'does the same as the NSA abroad'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Kai Biermann for the Guardian today examines the state of German security and says Europeans need to scrutinise their domestic security, rather than focusing on the NSA.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The German intelligence service – the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) – to name an example close to home, does exactly the same thing as the NSA abroad and it does so within a similar legal framework. &quot;The differences between the BND and the NSA are much smaller than is generally accepted by the public,&quot; write <a href=\"http://www.stiftung-nv.de/law_and_policy_in_internet_surveillance_programs\">Stefan Heumann and Ben Scott in their study</a> on the legal foundations of internet surveillance programmes in the US, the UK and Germany.</p> <p>Heumann works at the German thinktank Neue Verantwortung (New Responsibility), Scott was an adviser to the former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and is now a policy adviser at the Open Technology Institute, part of the New America Foundation thinktank.

Other reports, as we indicated (including from the New York Times in 2009), have previously reported on efforts to wiretap even members of Congress.</p> <p>A major reason why those in power always try to use surveillance is because surveillance = power. The more you know about someone, the more you can control and manipulate them in all sorts of ways.

From the Women Deliver conference in May, to the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting at the end of September, and most recently, the launch of the girl declaration on 1 October, there is a growing movement calling on policymakers to see girls as \"<a href=\"http://www.icrw.org/media/blog/adolescent-girls-are-critical-post-2015-agenda\" title=\"\">critical to the post-2015 development agenda</a>\".</p><p>Rather than speak on their behalf, organisations are now championing a model called 'girl-centred advocacy'. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/11/girl-centred-advocacy-adolescent-girls\" title=\"\">Denise Raquel Dunning explains</a> what that means of her organisation: \"Through Agali's model, girls strengthen their leadership capacity, conduct participatory needs assessments, and identify the factors that negatively affect their well-being, including harmful traditional practices, social norms, and weak policy frameworks. Girls then work with adult allies to advocate for their own solutions to the challenges they face, using community dialogue, media advocacy, and direct engagement with political decision-makers to transform their own lives and communities.\"</p><p>So, is it all that easy? How do organisations ensure that they are not just offering a platform to the elite, those girls in any community who are already literate and whose parents allow for her to attend meetings? More importantly, how can girl-centred advocacy be saved from becoming a gimmick? Finally, if it's all about the girls, what role is there for the organisations who have long spoken out on their behalf?</p><p>Join our live chat panel 1pm BST on Thursday, 10 October, as we discuss the ways to practically implement the ideal of girl-centred advocacy.</p><p><em>The live chat is not video or audio-enabled but will take place in the comments section (below).

First among them was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/malala-yousafzai?page=5\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai</a>, the 16-year old Pakistani girl who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/taliban-pakistan-shoot-girl-malala-yousafzai\" title=\"\">shot by the Taliban</a> in Pakistan's Swat Valley for wanting to go to school. Alongside her, presidents from South Africa and Bangladesh, the head of the World Bank and Gordon Brown in his role as special envoy on global education for Ban Ki-moon all stood and showed what they had set out to achieve.</p><p>Impressive as they were, the person who most captivated me was Malala's teacher, Mariam Khalique, who spoke, at a different event, about the transformative power of education and reminded us the catalytic difference a teacher makes.</p><p>Teachers are at the coalface of education, but are often forgotten. We know that to fulfill the goal of universal access to education by 2015, we need to recruit and train 1.7 million new teachers and a further 5.1million need to be replaced as they leave the profession—all this within the next 800 or so days until the 2015 millennium development goal target date is reached.</p><p>For those governments serious about reaching and surpassing MDG 2, there are three interventions that could make a huge contribution to the mission of ensuring every child receives a quality education. Whether they are in a rural school in the Swat Valley, or anywhere else. </p><p><strong>Invest in teacher training </strong></p><p>Establishing professional learning communities that bring together teachers, school leaders and collaborators at a school level can help them to share and embed new skills. In countries such as Cape Verde, Tanzania and Togo, <a href=\"http://www.ei-ie.org/en/news/news_details/2359\" title=\"\">less than 50% of their teaching force</a> are professionally qualified, which brings into focus the need to develop principals and school leaders as instructional leaders who are able to encourage professional development within schools.</p><p>Overcoming constraints on time and resources can be challenging for both school and system leaders, and it is fair to say that few systems have tackled these issues consistently over time. Some initiatives have helped to facilitate professional learning groups. The <a href=\"https://www.varkeygemsfoundation.org/home\" title=\"\">Varkey Gems Foundation</a>, for example, has committed to providing <a href=\"https://www.varkeygemsfoundation.org/projects/low-cost-teacher-training\" title=\"\">low cost training</a> to 250,000 teachers in developing countries and to help develop sustainable, in-school professional development groups. As a development investment, professional learning communities could bear a lot of fruit, because they draw on the expertise inherent in the workforce and give the teachers ownership of their own professional development and therefore their professional destinies.</p><p><strong>Build platforms to share best practice </strong></p><p>Networks between teachers, schools and education institutions can help provide a platform for sharing innovations that work. For example, <a href=\"http://www.educationinnovations.org/\" title=\"\">The Centre for Education Innovations</a> in east Africa has identified a number of teacher training providers that undertake similar activities, and linked them to work together to develop their training methodologies. This kind of information access and network is  particularly important for smaller organisations that often work in isolation, to help them benefit from lessons learned by others.</p><p><strong>Link parents with teachers for more accountability </strong></p><p>Parents could play a stronger role in improving educational outcomes if they felt empowered to consult teachers and monitor their performance. Parent-teacher associations and other committees can play a vital role in strengthening teacher accountability. Centralised top-down systems don't do much to promote parental participation. More attention should be put on encouraging consumer demand and enabling parents to have a greater say over the education of their children. Some development groups are making process in this area. For example, <a href=\"http://enezaeducation.com/\" title=\"\">Eneza Education</a>, based in Kenya, uses SMS technology to make student performance data accessible to both parents and teachers, to enhance communication and co-operation between them.</p><p><em>Vikas Pota is the CEO of </em><a href=\"http://www.varkeygemsfoundation.org\" title=\"\"><em>Varkey Gems foundation</em></a><em>.

Japan is also pushing for widespread use of advanced low-carbon technologies and products in various fields.</p><p>The JCM aims to facilitate diffusion of leading low-carbon technologies, products, systems, services, and infrastructure as well as implementation of mitigation actions, and contribute to sustainable development of developing countries. It also aims to evaluate reduction in greenhouse gas emission levels in a quantitative manner, by applying measurement, reporting and verification methodologies, and using them to achieve Japan's emissions reduction target.</p><p>The JCM will also contribute to the <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/2860.php\">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> objective by facilitating global actions for cutting emissions and complementing the clean development mechanism under the <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php\">Kyoto protocol</a>.  For example, a JCM project in Mongolia plans to replace conventional coal-based boilers with new energy-efficient ones. Reducing coal use will not only contribute to mitigation of climate change but also improve economic efficiency and air quality. Such efforts are being driven by Japan's financial and technological support through the JCM.</p><p>Japan and a host country establish a joint committee to govern and operate the JCM. The committee develops and adopts rules and guidelines, registers projects, and issues JCM credits for greenhouse gas emission reductions or removals. The committee is also tasked to prevent JCM projects from being registered under any other international climate mitigation mechanisms, to avoid double counting on emission reductions.</p><p>Under the JCM, emission reductions are defined as the difference between \"reference emissions\" and project emissions.  The reference emissions are calculated below business-as-usual emissions, which represent plausible emissions in providing the same outputs or service level of the proposed JCM project in the host country. Together with applying default values for several parameters in calculating emission reductions, these approaches ensure a net decrease and/or avoidance of emissions while reducing the burden of measurement, and increasing transparency for calculating  emission reductions.</p><p>A growing number of countries are joining the JCM, which this year has entered into a new phase. After continuous efforts to develop the concept through several studies and discussions with partner countries, the JCM is now ready for the implementation.</p><p>In January, Mongolia signed a bilateral pact with Japan to implement JCM in capital Ulan Bator. Since then Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Maldives, Vietnam and Laos have also joined JCM.</p><p>The government of Japan is strengthening its efforts to popularise JCM through demonstration of projects backed by financial investments in  advanced technologies, together with support for feasibility studies and capacity building in partner countries. The country is expecting JCM to start reducing emissions as it transfers technology to developing countries.</p><p><em><em>Yuji Mizuno is the director for international negotiations at the climate change policy division of the environment ministry of Japan. </em>For more information, visit the <a href=\"http://www.mmechanisms.org/e/\" title=\"\">New Mechanisms Information Platform</a></em></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

A good chunk of that <a href=\"http://www.altiusdirectory.com/Business/offshore-manufacturing.html\">money has to stay overseas</a>, so it can make sense for businesses to use these extra funds to start a healthcare arm overseas rather than to use the money to spur stateside growth.</p><p>\"Many life sciences companies have manufacturing outside use and they hold intellectual property outside of the US. Many of these companies have made billions and billions of dollars and they have that cash on their balance sheet,\" Drone said. Another plus? Using the money to grow in emerging economies likely means lower taxes, he adds. </p><p>Many big companies will find that an <a href=\"http://www.trefis.com/stock/ge/articles/106396/ge-healthcare-looks-to-low-cost-solutions-for-emerging-markets/2012-03-05\">already-established tie</a> will make the entry much easier.<br /> <br /><strong>New opportunities require new ways of marketing</strong><br /> <br />Don't expect you can just run a commercial or put up billboards to market your product. Business as usual will not work in emerging countries.</p><p>\"Communicating with consumers is a lot different. There are a lot of regulations and people have been fined for pretty big amounts for their marketing practices,\" Drone said.</p><p><strong>Seek a helping hand</strong><br />Partnerships with NGOs can strengthen both the quality of the services you can provide and, potentially, profit.</p><p>\"There's a greater understanding with the donors that this is actually something that can help deal with the reduction in development aid that you see from European countries and others\", Spieker said.<br /> <br /><strong>Be patient</strong><br /> <br />\"It takes time to build up a whole system,\" Spieker said. \"You start by building quality of care and then there will be a demand for your healthcare. People get to know and trust the system and then they will come to rely on your services.\"<br /> <br /><strong>Price really matters</strong><br /> <br />It may seem obvious, but in emerging markets, you need to price to sell, not go for the highest price the market can bear. </p><p>\"In the past you could price your technology, your product in the US, on a level where you could make a handsome return on your R&amp;D investment, but you have to lower the price in emerging economies,\" Drone said. \"If you want to maximize the value of an asset, you have to go to more of a volume plan than a price plan.\" </p><p><em>Jennifer Inez Ward is a freelance writer and photographer in Oakland, California</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/2/1380737141158/Daily-Life-In-Siem-Reap-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/healthcare-investors-brics-emerging-markets","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/healthcare-investors-brics-emerging-markets","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"Global development podcast: Big ideas for development after 2015 – transcript","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-02T10:43:34Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2013/oct/02/global-development-podcast-2015-transcript","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>HM:</strong> Hugh Muir</p><p><strong>AC:</strong> Alex Cobham</p><p><strong>BC:</strong> Barbara Crowther</p><p><strong>MK:</strong> Dr Musimbi Kanyoro</p><p><strong>LF:</strong> Liz Ford</p><p></p><p><strong>HM</strong> Hello and welcome to the Global development podcast. My name's Hugh Muir. Coming up, the millennium development goals, or MDGs, are up for renewal in 2015. Between now and then diplomats and activists from every country will talk long and hard about shaping new goals for the future. But before we go forward, let's look back: have the development goals achieved everything that was hoped for? And what about those targets? Even if we do agree new goals is that really the best way to achieve sustainable development? Today we'll hear from three big thinkers with big ideas about how about to build a better world. This is the Global development podcast from the Guardian. And with me in the studio today are Alex Cobham, research fellow at the Centre for Global Development; and Barbara Crowther, director of policy and public affairs at the Fairtrade Foundation. And in our New York office we have Dr Musimbi Kanyoro, president of the Global Fund for Women, and Liz Ford, deputy editor of Global development at the Guardian. Thank you all for joining us.</p><p>And, Liz, let me start with you before we get stuck into those big ideas, let's start with a little context. At the time of recording there's a big meeting at the United Nations, that's why you're there, apart from the obvious charms of New York of course, so tell us what's going on there?</p><p><strong>LF</strong> The UN has its development moment over the next three days, where we're expecting leaders to review where we're at with the MDGs, where we've got, what we need to do in the next two years to actually achieve the 2015 target. And then looking beyond that, what happens after 2015 – the next set of goals. And there have been discussions been going on all year. The UN have commissioned a high level panel co-chaired by David Cameron to come up with some kind of vision. And in their report in May they produced a draft set of 12 goals, which seemed to have sort of captured the imagination and seemed to be used quite readily at any kind of conversation, almost like these are the ideas for a new set of goals; but there still needs to be lots of discussion. And what we're expecting this week is to get some kind of idea about whether these goals are going to be universal, and for the UN to set in motion what's going to happen next, so the next two years there's key marker points about when deadlines are to come up with these ideas. And in a sense this is sort of the year of throwing up ideas I think, and just throwing everything into the ring and then just seeing what settles.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Liz, these development goals were agreed over a decade ago now. So why look at them again? Is it that we've achieved them all or it is just that they're not relevant?</p><p><strong>LF</strong> It's not that the problems aren't the same; there's just like panic – what do we do after 2015? MDGs have been seen to galvanise action so it's almost like we need something else to galvanise action. And I think how the MDGs were framed, that's not relevant now. There's still lots of relevant problems but it's how these goals are framed and the big issue is are they universal? And if you're bringing in a sustainable development element to this, and there's a working group currently trying to come up with some sustainable development goals, then it's got to be universal because if you're going to deal with environmental issues this is going to impact every country, global north/global south. So I think that's where the thinking is coming from.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Okay, Liz, well thanks for that. And we'll hear more from you later. So of course what we'll do is we'll hear over the course of this podcast three big ideas about where we might go in the future and let's go to the first of those. As I say Barbara Crowther is the director of policy and public affairs at the Fairtrade Foundation, and Barbara you've had very specific ideas about the targets, tell us a little bit about that.</p><p><strong>BC</strong> Well I think we've had millennium development goals and I think a lot of the focus was really on those measures of halving extreme poverty as measured by the dollar twenty five a day. And I think we need to move on from that framing now to what Liz was talking about which is a universal of what we call sustainable development goals. So what does sustainable development look like both north and south? So yes poverty is part of that picture but it's also about how do we deliver the advances whilst operating within the safe ecological boundaries and limits that we have? So how do we deliver human wellbeing and ecological security for everyone? If you take an example you could say it's not just about increasing the yield of a smallholder farmer it's about whether the percentage of farmers that are practicing sustainable farming, managing water, managing their resources, having access to land and actually earning a livelihood and being resilient to economic and ecological shocks. It's about how can you make sure that development results in people being able to invest in low carbon technology, for example. In Fairtrade, for example, we've seen how equitable, sustainable trade means that farmers have been able to invest themselves in solar powered energy for their villages; so they're increasing their services but they're doing it on the basis of sustainable consumption at this end, promoting a market amongst consumers for purchasing and living sustainably, reducing food waste, buying into ecological products and then delivering sustainability at the other end.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Give me an example of a way that you can specifically measure a target in activity like that?</p><p><strong>BC</strong> There's all sorts of quirky things that you could do so in Rwanda, for example, as a result of building a sustainable coffee production base the number of hairdressers in local villages have gone up. So it's how far is trade delivering small scale enterprise and creating jobs and equitable growth. It could be about what proportion of people are actually accessing low carbon technology, what percentage of smallholder farmers have access to climate adaptation support, for example. Those might be some of the types of indicator that we could be considering.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> What was missing before? Is that we didn't have the right targets or were we just not measuring them properly, were they being reached?</p><p><strong>BC</strong> If you take food as an example the targets were very much about ending extreme hunger, halving the number of people experiencing extreme hunger, but didn't take into consideration the disparities in people's access to food or, for example, the proportion of food that is simply going to waste. About a third of the food in developed economies is going to waste. And, at the same time, we're pushing towards cheaper and cheaper food and then that's making it a disposal commodity. So actually there's something which is about how do we manage food consumption in the north and deliver sustainable fairly traded food; and then how do we deliver sustainably produced food amongst farmers? So what proportion of farmers are earning a sustainable livelihood would be a good indicator.</p><p><strong>MH</strong> Alex Cobham, let me bring you in there because of course we have to have targets but as Barbara was saying they can bring a complication all on their own.</p><p><strong>AC</strong> Barbara's idea is very interesting not least because of the data that would be required in order to track through, for example, the amount of different types of resources being used in competing ways of farming. Having that data on a consistent basis would really allow you to see much more clearly, both as a consumer and as a policymaker the impact of going down different roads. And I think that would really start to focus us on how far away we are from sustainable agriculture and which direction can take us towards that. So I think it's a great idea.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> What has been the deficiency of the targeting up to now?</p><p><strong>AC</strong> Where to begin?</p><p><strong>HM</strong> We only have 35 minutes, but do what you can!</p><p><strong>AC</strong> Broadly the millennium development goals partly because they're a creature of their time, the discussions in 2000 are very different to the type of discussions that we've had since, particularly at Copenhagen around climate change, but there just wasn't a focus on sustainability in the way that there is now through most of development thinking. So these types of ideas would have been raised by some people within the conversation but they just wouldn't have been central. And that's what we see in the MDGs, they're largely about meeting absolute need today with very little thought for the implications of that in terms of the planet's sustainability.</p><p><strong>BC</strong> And if you take the millennium development goal number seven which was the one that was seen as being the one that came closest to an environmental framework that's one of the ones that is the most off track – I think only 10% of the low level indicators have actually been met. So yes there was some increase in people's access to water, the sanitation target's way off, but really importantly biodiversity loss, which was one of the indicators there, we've gone backwards in the last ten years.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Musimbi Kanyoro in New York, on this issue of targeting if we had to revisit that and how it's done what would you tell them?</p><p><strong>MK</strong> I would tell them that what failed us in the whole of the last MDG was we focused a lot on issues. But what we learnt that for every one of the issues that we dealt with when women are not considered to be the top priority we don't make progress on those issues. So I would really say one of the things that is really important is to have an independent MDG, or whatever we shall call it, that looks on gender equality. Because we talk of agriculture, we're going to look and see that actually in many developing countries 70% of the people in agriculture are women. And if there is no gender equality that looks at what they are contributing to that level we're still not going to be able to sustain what is happening in agriculture. We look at the question of security of violence, and we see that the most impacted people in wars, in areas of conflict etc are women. And when we don't look at that we'll just find that once again we are dancing in the place. And one of the MDGs that really did not meet its target is the MDG on sexual and reproductive health.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Dr Kanyoro we'll talk more about the specific of the goals that refer to gender in just a moment. But just talking about targeting, and Liz can I just bring you in here: what's the feeling about the targeting process as to whether or not it needs a review, what are you hearing?</p><p><strong>LF</strong> Well, I think it was quite interesting that just listening to what everyone's been saying and the targeting's an issue, but right now it just seems from certainly civil society that the issue of funding and economics seems to be more in people's head than targeting. Everyone assumes or would like to see, most people I've spoken to, would like to see a universal set of goals and whatever your particular issue is you'd want sanitation having a target, and you'd want sexual and reproductive rights to have a target – you'd have all these things in. But the big thing that's coming out is calls for restructuring of the financial institutions; so restructuring the IMF, restructuring the World Bank to put funding in place that gives countries ownership over what they do with their funds. And this whole idea of some kind of paradigm shift in thinking we can have a new set of targets in universal goals, but if there isn't this kind of move to give governments easier access and more power over finances then nothing is going to be achieved in the same way. And what's been missed over the last 13 years those sort of things are going to be missed again. So it was quite interesting just hearing that seems to be the message that's coming from civil society.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Okay. I'm going to go back to Dr Musimbi Kanyoro there in New York because she was talking about the gender element of the goals, and of course some say that improving the lives of women would impact on all of the development goals across the board. But of course there is that goal three from the last set promoting gender equality and empowering women; give me your sense of what's happened in the past ten years.</p><p><strong>MK</strong> I think they need to raise the bar because one of the things that it did is that it did create a consciousness so that there are many actors now that can talk about gender equality. But it also, by increasing the visibility, it also has increased a kind of resistant bug that we see continuing to come on especially from people that think that this MDG is not in line with their culture or their religious beliefs. And if we do not continue very, very strongly on that and also create targets for it because we're talking more than 50% of the global population that we want to address, then again we won't be able to make the progress that we need to do.</p><p>And for me it also involves investing a sufficient amount of resources, financial and otherwise, that will go on to translate this gender equality into empowerment of actual women as individuals but also as communities.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Is it a hard sell persuading people that the gender element is important across the board; that it shouldn't just be looked at in isolation that it really impinges on everything?</p><p><strong>MK</strong> I think currently because now we have a number of researches that have been done, including a research by the World Bank, that shows what you gain by investing in women, but also the research that had been done by independent institutions, so there is evidence, there is data. And we can rise beyond just speaking, just words about women. But the fear is not the fear that women will be included rather it is the subordination of women that is inherent in the patriarchal systems that exist all over the world.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> So as we think about what goals we'll have going forward what is it that you're hoping for; what would success look like?</p><p><strong>MK</strong> Success for me would look like really investments; investment of money, of resources, of talents into women. Investing in women-led initiatives, investing in women's organisations that are currently really pushing the envelope on laws and policies being changed and cultural norms being changed in places. Those that are using a human rights and justice framework to look at what is happening in their communities; looking at the issues of security, food; looking at the issues of economics, looking at the issues of inclusion in politics – really investing and really trusting that they are going to be the ones that challenge their own governments to make a move in those particular areas.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> And, Barbara, let me quickly bring you in there – how do we raise the status, if you like, of the gender issue across the board?</p><p><strong>BC</strong> First of all, I think it is imperative that we do do so. One of the issues around the millennium goals is that I think it was a very top down process and I think we've already seen in the conversations that have been going on for the last year or two that it's been a bit more of a bottom up process. So I think first of all it's about the inclusion of women in the translation of any new set of goals in its implementation at a national, at a local level and the empowerment of women through that process.</p><p>We've certainly seen that for every pound you invest in women whether that's in women's entrepreneurship or whether that's women's access to agricultural, technical know-how you actually get a really, really good return on that investment. So I think it would be a really sensible investment to make.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Alex Cobham, are we missing a trick?</p><p><strong>AC</strong> I don't think so. People talk about in the MDGs that the greater success was goal 1A the reduction of people living in absolute income poverty – I think that's nonsense on stilts. Partly because a lot of what happened would have happened anyway and we successfully watered down the actual quantitative meaning of that goal. So even by the time it was set, China had already ensured that East Asia had met their goal for 2015.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> So it was illusory you think?</p><p><strong>AC</strong> I think it drew the attention in a way that's actually not very helpful if we're looking back and thinking about what worked. In fact what I'd say is the greater success of the MDGs is MDG three. It wasn't so much that we've seen enormous changes in the ratios of girls and boys going to school it was the setting of a norm that gender equality was something that every society everywhere ought to be aiming for. And not only in terms of who goes to primary school but actually much more broadly. The way that norm was understood and translated politically and socially and culturally was, I think, much more important than any specific changes that happened in terms of, let's say, investment in education. Now you could say we had that in the last set so why do we need it in post-2015? I think the answer is in that question – if you step back now I think it risks sending a message that this is no longer a priority, no longer something that should be seen as a norm perhaps to the same extent.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Liz in New York, what's your take on this?</p><p><strong>LF</strong> I think that anyone that you would speak to here from civil society, from UN women would say there has been some progress. But there's still so much work to do. And I think that bears out when you speak to, say, Uganda. You go to a rural area of Uganda and you speak to women there and you see what's happened. And some things have shifted so you have got more girls going to school up until primary school, but then you've got a big issue of child marriage; so OK families might be happy for the child to go to school until they're 12 but after that, no. So you've got to break down those sorts of barriers afterwards.</p><p>I think everyone knows that regardless of what you think about any goals or targets having gender equality as a goal and having indicators and how it's treaded through just reminds people of nothing else that you need to attack with these issues. And it has been the one that hasn't properly been achieved. And there have been lots of ideas about gender mainstreaming so that everything that you do, every kind of UN policy makes sure there's a certain number of women in it. It all seems to come down to a shift in power and I know, Barbara, at a round table I think you touched on this and it's where does the power lie and I think any new goals or indicators need to indicate that the power needs to shift so men still aren't in charge, women really need to seize power and move for anything to really change.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> I want to bring Barbara in in just a moment, but in the spring you were in New York for a meeting on women's rights – what's the thinking there and what's the evaluation there of where they are so far and where they need to go?</p><p><strong>LF</strong> In March there was a commission on the status of women which was looking specifically at violence against women and eliminating violence against women. And it was quite worrying in certain governments, certain groups were lobbying hard to effectively roll back the rights that women have worked so hard to actually achieve. And there was a massive fight to actually get an actual outcome document to vow to eliminate violence against women and girls. And it just seemed like two weeks of intense discussions to move a centimetre forward almost and it was quite shocking to see that there was this amazing opposition and to actually see it in all its glory. And you've got this real kind of sexual reproductive health and rights, giving women rights over their body; so access to family planning, abortion in this kind of context it has such stiff opposition and I think that's going to be a continuing challenge.</p><p><strong>MK</strong> Women's rights movements who are here and who were here in March really insist that equality and human dignity has to take precedence over customs and traditions. And they are working towards that and it doesn't matter whether you come from a religious background or whether you come from a cultural background that has done certain things for a long time, they are not right to do now. And that's what we want to happen.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> And Barbara?</p><p><strong>BC</strong> This issue of power is absolutely critical to the whole of the framework I think so whether you're looking at it from the point of view of access to climate adaptation, whether you're looking at it from a gender point of view there is this huge issue. So if you're a cocoa farmer today in West Africa you're earning probably between 3% and 6% of the value of a chocolate bar compared to 18% in the 1980s. So whilst there's been this progress in people investing in sustainable agriculture actually the value is not shifting and the control of that trade has become incredibly concentrated and as a result millions of small scale farmers are relatively powerless. And so we have to address power and the big elephant in the room really is this shift of power that's going on at the moment from the state and the public sector into the private sector. We work with a lot of businesses, I'm absolutely in favour of using trade as a tool for development, of getting business to play its role, but we need to make sure that goes alongside accountable frameworks that those businesses have to then be made accountable for the social and environmental and economic impacts and contribute into and doing business in a better way that delivers more value back to developing countries.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Barbara, thank you. You mentioned the economic impact and I sense we're going to get into that in just a moment because as I say we're looking at three big ideas; we've talked about targeting, we've talked about the gender issue. Finally in this edition let's here from Alex Cobham he's, as I said, the research fellow at the Centre for Global Development. And you have big ideas about income equality and inequality.</p><p><strong>AC</strong> Well let me build up to that, Hugh. I'm going to start with a big problem – the easiest thing to do for rich countries is to set targets for poor countries. And I think at the risk of being marginally unfair that's pretty much where the MDGs come from and why they look like they do. So there's two things that we ought to turn around in that dynamic. The first one is that the post-2015 framework must include binding targets for rich countries aid donor countries themselves. And that takes us down a set of roads: one is dealing much more comprehensively with questions of sustainability and environmental impact which if, in a sense, if you limit goals to poorer countries only of course you're not getting anywhere near a planetary solution.</p><p>So what I propose is that rather than looking for a post-2015 agreement that sets the goals and targets for every country instead we follow up on … the argument I was making about gender is important in the MDGs that it was the norm setting that mattered rather than the specific target, we look at setting areas in which the norm says \"there should be a target\" and then we devolve to national political processes the setting of that actual target.</p><p>So let's take the example of income inequality as you mentioned. The high level panel report co-chaired by David Cameron said that income inequality was too political for there to be a target as if somehow telling a set of lower income countries that they must have targets on policy, on sustainability, on child mortality as if that's not political, as if that's not setting priorities and budgets and so on. So that question of it being political I think is a difficult one. But if we go with what the high level panel says there what it means is not, I think, that therefore we shouldn't talk about inequality it's that there should be a political process around inequality. Now think, for a moment, how powerful could it be if we had rippling across the world in each country involved the question being asked in democratic processes what is the type of inequality that is acceptable, what's an acceptable inequality of child mortality say between the richest and poorest?</p><p><strong>HM</strong> That's sounds fine but what is the political reality of that because if you close the income gap you almost inevitably take money from the rich, are they really going to agree to that?</p><p><strong>AC</strong> Every country in the world, every society in the world is effectively day to day choosing what it considers the acceptable level of income inequality, that's not going to be the same in every society and we can see that looking across rich countries there are great variance, great differences. But the one thing we can be sure of is if we take it off the table, if we say this is not a fit subject to discuss the tendency is for inequality to rise.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> How do you persuade rich countries that they should almost cede control of the process in that way because at the moment they do, pretty much, have control of the process?</p><p><strong>AC</strong> I think it's a question of how they see development. If donor countries are going to hold fast this idea that really they ought to be able to set priorities for other countries, which I think is indefensible when it's out in the open like that, then I think we have a problem. But I think once you confront that idea and you ask what is it that we're looking for here most people involved would say an important element of this is the political empowerment of people living in developing countries. And that means not saying: \"Here are the targets, let's see if your government meets them.\" It means saying: \"Here are some areas, what targets do you want to set for your government in each of these areas?\"</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Musimbi in New York do you think that that is realistic, I mean it's obviously very desirable to change the balance of power in these things but is it realistic that it might happen easily or happen soon?</p><p><strong>MK</strong> It's a good thing to talk about but we don't know anywhere in history where people have given up power easily by themselves. Because people do count what is in it for them. And this is the same when we are talking about the public/private cooperation that we have now and emphasising business it's the same. There's power there, there's the power of money, there's the power of having to make profit that will have to be there. And even when you take countries by themselves and say OK you're going to tell the countries to set their own limitations, again even within the countries women still have limited access to power and responsibilities in the public sphere due to the prevailing inequality at the family level, inequality at the society level; so either way the only way we'll be able to balance power is if we don't put the recognition just in the governments but really be able to see the movements, people's movements, indigenous movements, women's movements that actually do name power as an issue.</p><p><strong>AC</strong> Spot on. But the question of involving a political discussion let's take gender, think about gender inequality – it's true if we have these discussions within countries that have gender inequality, and let's not forget that rich countries actually have less female representation in parliament than a lot of developing countries. But anyway, if we have those discussions it's true that we're doing it within an unequal context but which country, which government wants to be the one which globally has set the lowest, the weakest possible target out of all countries on gender inequality, or on the inequality between the top 10% and the bottom 40% by income, let's say. I think once you open this process up you have a set of international pressures as well as domestic ones which ultimately may point in a good direction. Certainly I would say better than if we pretend there's no politics involved here, that we can set this all internationally and not ask these questions domestically.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Barbara, what do you think how do we change this balance of power?</p><p><strong>BC</strong> I think the tectonic plates are shifting already and we need to get wise to that. So the emerging economies are already shifting the balance of power in lots of ways. I think the broad principle of saying how do we create the political processes and empower ordinary people to hold their own governments accountable, to set the right frameworks for how and where business is involved in the delivery of these kind of goals is absolutely spot on. And I think it would raise some really interesting debates. So it's not just jobs but it's what is the disparity between any country's national minimum wage, which in most developing countries you have to have three or four jobs at that wage to be able to survive.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Think about this: how do we factor in the fact that a lot of governments might be given more authority to take more local decisions and have local targets but they won't be democratic so are they really reflecting the targets that the people might want?</p><p><strong>AC</strong> But I think if you have no discussion around appropriate levels of inequality, whether that's economic inequality or inequality between ethnolinguistic groups let's say or by gender then the absence of that discussion facilitates a set of policies that are more likely to exacerbate that inequality. What I'm suggesting here is that by forcing this on to the agenda at least you require that discussion to happen. Now governments can then be good or bad, they can meet targets or not, they can agree good targets or not but at least that process has begun, there's been a discussion, you've allowed people, to some extent, to air their views. And I think from then you have a sense that the targets that are set are much more likely to be met.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Okay. Let's go back to Liz Ford our deputy editor for Global development, she's in our New York studio, Liz, you've been hearing all that, does this reflect some of what you've been hearing in New York as well as they discuss what their next steps?</p><p><strong>LF </strong>Obviously there's more than 1,000 representatives of civil society here who are lobbying their case and Ban Ki-moon has talked about the importance of civil society groups in meeting any kind of set of goals or MDGs, but also anything that comes afterwards. A recent report warns that a lot of civil society groups are finding it very hard to operate in their own countries. So it ties into the power thing so even if you shift responsibility to governments, as you said, if you haven't got a government that's receptive to being questioned or to being pushed then you're going to run up against difficulties.</p><p>It's quite interesting just to hear how tricky the funding issue is going to be and how people are really pushing for these things. And also trying to understand about how the human rights frame is actually going to work because we've got all these declarations on the table that have been there for years, so in a sense someone was saying to me do we need another set of goals because in theory we have all this UN framework here so why aren't we just looking at that and using it. So I think how those things are going to be teased out will be the challenge. And I think a lot of NGOs will be very pleased if there is an announcement about accelerating progress on the MDGs. But in a sense it feels a little bit like it's almost had its day and everyone's looking at post-2015 and how we get the new lot. And in a sense how important is it for us to meet those MDG targets now?</p><p><strong>HM</strong> So, Liz, just before we go a lot of discussion is going on there, what should we be looking out for next; what's the next big issue?</p><p><strong>LF</strong> This is obviously an interesting time whatever comes out of the next two days we're expecting an outcome document committing the UN to move on, accelerate and all those sort of things. But I think the next two years are going to be … in a sense 2013 is an important year, it's party year, it's blue skies year, it's throw everything in – but the next two years is when it gets really sort of down and dirty about trying to come up with what are these new set of goals going to look like. And I think what's going to be interesting is next year the open working group on the sustainable development goals report back, and I think that really could put the cat amongst the pigeons because they're going to come back with suggestions about environmental sustainability and the word \"environmental\" will just freak a lot of governments out I imagine.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Dr Musimbi Kanyoro what should we be looking out for from your point of view?</p><p><strong>MK</strong> I always take the stand that for anything that we want to do we have to begin from the people themselves that are going to experience it. If we're going to talk about poverty, poverty has a face to it. And so what I've been observing of late is what is happening in regions, what is happening in countries, even in times of their own people getting more voice to challenge the systems under which they exist, like we've seen in the Middle East; or new constitutions that are beginning actually to discuss the issue of democratising constitutions in countries. Egypt is working on a new constitution. Kenya, two years ago, passed a new constitution that has got many opportunities for men and women to work together. And then this whole big debate about the role of men in development. I think that the next focus should not only be on what happens in gender equality in regards to women actually but the responsibilities also that men and governments that have been in the past considered conservative can do, or are doing.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Thank you. Barbara Crowther, what next?</p><p><strong>BC</strong> The big question is how far this framework is going to be a MDG with a few add-ons or whether it is actually going to try and come up with a slightly more transformative framework. I think Liz is right about the working group on inclusive sustainable development goals. I think there are real questions about how far we link other processes in such as if we're talking about leveraging the power of the private sector how do we hardwire in the number of businesses that are in compliance with the new UN guiding principles on Business and Human Rights, for example.</p><p>And then financing is obviously going to remain a really big issue; where does the money come from for investment. And new forms of investment; it was good to see tax included in the high level panel amongst their recommendations. But I think the real challenge is going to be how far does that high level panel report form the basis of moving forward; or will some of the slightly more radical ideas get filtered back out and we end up with just a slight tweak of the existing framework which would be an opportunity missed if that happened.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> OK. And last with the crystal ball, Alex Cobham?</p><p><strong>AC</strong> OK. So two things: one is we've heard from Liz and Musimbi particularly about problems of governments being unresponsive to civil society. If we go down the MDG road in effect we'll pretend that that doesn't matter and we'll have a set of goals that can be met effectively by a dictatorship. I don't think we should do that, I don't think we're going to do that. So questions around effective political participation will become more prominent.</p><p>The other aspect just to pick up is on illicit financial flows where the high level panel has recommended there be a target. I think we're going to see some really exciting discussions over what an appropriate target would be to combat tax evasion, tax avoidance related flows of money laundering, and I'm hoping CGD plays a role in that.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> OK well things to look forward to in the short term and the long term too. But that's about all we have time for on this podcast. My thanks to Liz Ford in New York, and all of our big thinkers who were Alex Cobham, Dr Musimbi Kanyoro and Barbara Crowther.

The momentum of short-term exploitation of people and resources, which exemplifies the present model of capitalism in vogue world-wide, will not easily be stopped, or even slowed down, simply by asking Apple to slap on a few more human-friendly apps or seeding clouds with seawater.

Two of the strategies under consideration are cloud seeding and the injection of sulphate particles into the upper atmosphere, in both cases with the intention of reducing the solar radiation reaching the earth. However, such an approach would mean that both thermal and photovoltaic solar panels would work less efficiently, thereby increasing the demand on carbon-based energy sources. Thus these approaches might prove to be self-defeating.</p><p>As Lord Rees says, the time to start decarbonising the world's power generation is now.<br /><strong>Roger Browne</strong><br />Alexandra, New Zealand</p><h2><strong>Keep Kenya's aquifers safe</strong></h2><p>The discovery of vast aquifers in the arid areas of north-west Kenya (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/11/kenya-water-discovery-drought-relief\" title=\"\">20&nbsp;September</a>) is good news indeed as it has the potential to transform the livelihoods of the people in the area.

Ron Wyden: NSA 'repeatedly deceived the American people' | Glenn Greenwald","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-27T11:14:00Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/27/ron-wyden-nsa-systematically-deceived","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>(updated below - Update II [Sat.])</strong></p><p>The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/nsa-surveillance-senate-committee?CMP=twt_gu\">held a hearing</a>, ostensibly to investigate various issues raised about the NSA's activities. What the hearing primarily achieved instead was to underscore what a farce the notion of Congressional oversight over the NSA is. </p><p>In particular, the current chair of the Senate Committee created in the mid-1970s to oversee the intelligence community just so happens to be one of the nation's most steadfast and blind loyalists of and apologists for the National Security State: Dianne Feinstein. For years she has abused her position to shield and defend the NSA and related agencies rather than provide any meaningful oversight over it, which is a primary reason why it has grown into such an out-of-control and totally unaccountable behemoth.</p><p>Underscoring the purpose of yesterday's hearing (and the purpose of Feinstein's Committee more broadly): the witnesses the Committee first heard from were all Obama officials - Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, NSA chief Gen. Keith Alexander, Deputy Attorney James Cole - who vehemently defended every aspect of the NSA. At the conclusion of their testimony, Feinstein announced that it was very, very important to hear from the two non-governmental witnesses the Committee had invited: <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-shot-2013-09-26-at-5.01.04-PM.png\">virulent NSA defender</a> <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/08/the-nsa-the-washington-post-and-the-administration/\">Ben Wittes</a> of the Brooking Institution and <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323309404578617463152440542.html\">virulent NSA defender Timothy Edgar</a>, a former Obama national security official. Hearing only from dedicated NSA apologists as witnesses: <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/2013/09/26/dianne-feinstein-gives-nsa-apologist-ben-wittes-more-oversight-time-than-ron-wyden/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=dianne-feinstein-gives-nsa-apologist-ben-wittes-more-oversight-time-than-ron-wyden\">that's \"oversight\" for Dianne Feinstein</a> and her oversight Committee. </p><p>Democratic Sen. Mark Warner stated the obvious to Gen. Alexander: \"a lot of Americans have lost trust in what you're doing.\" But of course they all spent the entire afternoon blaming Snowden and \"the media\" for this development rather than taking any responsibility themselves. The very idea that meaningful reform of the NSA will come out of this annexed, captured, corrupted Committee is ludicrous on its face.</p><p>But there are two members of that Committee who actually do take seriously its oversight mandate: Democrats Ron Wyden and Mark Udall. Those two <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/us/politics/democratic-senators-warn-about-use-of-patriot-act.html?_r=0\">spent years publicly winking and hinting that the NSA</a> under President Obama was engaged in all sorts of radical and abusive domestic surveillance (although - despite the <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/1/breach_or_debate_congress_snowden_prism%20\">absolute immunity protection they enjoy as Senators under the Constitution</a> - they took no action, and instead waited for Edward Snowden (who had no such immunity) to bravely step up and reveal to the American people specifically what these two Senators kept hinting at). </p><p>Wyden spoke yesterday for 6 minutes - part of of it as monologue and part of it questioning Gen. Alexander - and it's really worth watching the video, embedded below. The Oregon Democrat condemned what he called \"the intrusive, constitutionally flawed surveillance system\" the NSA built. About Snowden's whistleblowing, he said that NSA officials should have known from \"a quick read of history, in America, the truth always managed to come out.\" And his primary point was this: \"<strong>the leadership of NSA built an intelligence collection system that repeatedly deceived the American people</strong>.\"</p><p>Indeed, if I had to pick the single most revealing aspect of this entire NSA scandal - and there are many revealing ones about many different realms - it would be that James Clapper <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/11/sen-wyden-clapper-didnt-give-straight-answer-on-nsa-programs/\">lied to the faces of the Senate Intelligence Committee about core NSA matters</a>, and not only was he not prosecuted <a href=\"http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/I/47/1001\">for that felony</a>, but he did not even lose his job, and continues to be treated with great reverence by the very Committee which he deliberately deceived. That one fact tells you all you need to know about how official Washington functions.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF40mZbrd7I\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uF40mZbrd7I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><h2>Related issues</h2><p>This is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/opinion/have-a-nice-day-nsa.html?hp\">an insightful, and quite hilarious, Op-ed</a> in the New York Times this morning by the Brazilian journalist Vanessa Barbara about how Brazilians are using humor to mock and subvert the NSA's surveillance schemes.</p><p>Finally, in case there are any people left who thought that exploiting Terrorism and fear-mongering over it for power was a unique by-product of the Bush era (and really: could there <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/harry-reid-rand-paul-spar-over-patriot-act-on-senate-floor/2011/05/25/AGcgWRBH_blog.html\">really be any people left who believe that at this point?</a>), <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/324499-nsa-chief-pleads-for-publics-help-as-congress-eyes-restrictions#ixzz2g5cAVyzd\">Gen.

It is hard to put into words just how comprehensively accurate his remarks are.</p><h2>UPDATE II [Sat.]</h2><p>On Twitter, Wittes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benjaminwittes/status/383914571926220800\">objects</a> to my description of him as a \"virulent NSA defender\", saying: \"I am certainly an NSA defender, but curious what I have said that strikes you as 'virulent'. I try to keep virulence out of it.\" It's a fair point, and was a bad word choice on my part. I meant to convey that he's steadfast, relentless and intense in his defense of the NSA - I probably was thinking of \"vehement\". \"Virulent\" connotes poisonous or spiteful rhetoric and Wittes generally avoids that. In my view, he's certainly a hard-core apologist for NSA abuses and more generally a highly loyal US government defender, but he usually employs a Brookings-type civil tone when engaging in all that.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/27/ron-wyden-nsa-systematically-deceived","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/27/ron-wyden-nsa-systematically-deceived","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Today's media stories from the papers","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-26T08:44:55Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/2013/sep/26/media-briefing-thursday-26-september","fields":{"body":"<h2>Top eight stories on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media\">MediaGuardian</a></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418304626'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/18/1379522217797/John-Whittingdale-008.jpg' alt='John Whittingdale' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/26/google-mps-music-film-piracy\">Google attacked by MPs over failure to curb music and film piracy</a><br /> Company accused of 'derisory' attempts to stop many illegal downloads amid concerns over level of influence in coalition</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/26/wpp-martin-sorrell-richard-desmond-group-m\">WPP chief denies its media buying arm bullies broadcasters</a><br /> Sir Martin Sorrell responds to claim by Richard Desmond that Group M's power means broadcasters feel forced to work with it</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/25/bbc-uk-top-source-news-ofcom\">BBC rated UK's top source for news</a><br /> Ofcom report shows television is the most important platform for news, with 34% of adults turning to BBC1</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/25/mark-thompson-bbc-financial-scrutiny\">Thompson: more financial scrutiny could undermine BBC</a><br /> Advertising Week: Former director general also questions whether trust chairman Lord Patten's call for cuts in senior managers is a new initiative</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/25/radio-listeners-resist-digital\">Analogue radio listeners resist digital switch</a><br /> Record numbers listening to radio via digital platforms, but sales of DAB sets have been flat for past four years</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/sep/25/edmiliband-national-newspapers\">Ed Miliband: Tory press harks back to 1950s</a><br /> Roy Greenslade considers the national dailies' coverage of the Labour leader's speech</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/25/damian-mcbride-publisher-iain-dale-police\">Damian McBride's publisher faces new police interview</a><br /> Iain Dale asked to return to police station in relation to an alleged assault on anti-nuclear protester</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/sep/26/comedy-twitter\">Journalist claims comedian punched him after critical tweets</a><br /> No joke as police arrest angry comic</p><h2>Top comment on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media\">MediaGuardian</a></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/sep/25/page-3-sun\">The Sun is defined by Page 3 – that's why it won't win new readers</a><br /> Roy Greenslade on the continuing problem facing the paper that goes on running pictures of topless women</p><h2>Today's headlines</h2><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk\">The Guardian</a></strong></p><p>Google attacked over failure to curb piracy.

[...]</p> <p>Two members of Iran’s parliament, including the country’s sole Jewish MP, are also accompanying Rouhani. Ahmadinejad did not take a single MP to New York last year, according to Fararu, perhaps due to his feud with the parliamentarians in his final years in office. </p> <p>Iranian media said Rouhani was staying in Millennium UN Plaza. Ahmadinejad stayed in Warwick Hotel last year. Fararu estimated that Ahmadinejad’s stay at the Warwick for 5 days cost nearly $500,000, against an estimated $175,000 for Rouhani’s visit. </p> </blockquote> <p>Separately, Iranian foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif has been writing on Facebook about his New York trip.

Both leaders are expected to elaborate on expressions in the last weeks of mutual respect and a desire to interface. Rouhani is not two months in office and is the center of a great deal of optimism. Furthermore, according to former Iranian president <strong>Mohammad Khatami</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/iran-west-not-turn-back-diplomacy\">writing in the Guardian </a>on Monday, Rouhani has the power to negotiate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Explicit public support <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/sep/21/iran-heroic-flexibility-diplomacy-martyrdom\">from the supreme leader</a> of the Islamic republic provides Rouhani and his colleagues with the necessary authority for a diplomatic resolution of a number of foreign policy issues with the west, not just the nuclear issue.</p> </blockquote> <p>The EU foreign policy chief, <strong>Catherine Ashton</strong>, met with Iranian foreign minister<strong> Mohammad Javad Zarif</strong> in New York Monday. She said Zarif would meet with US secretary of state John Kerry on Thursday, in what would be the first ministerial talks between Tehran and Washington since the Islamic revolution in 1979.</p> <p>Seasoned observers on all sides, and not just Israel, are counseling caution as a potential new phase of international conversation begins. The leaders of both Iran and Syria have projects they would like more time to complete – time that could be created by ultimately fruitless talk. But the assumption is the talks in New York this week don&apos;t have to be fruitless and might yield a breakthrough.</p> <p>Headlines may also be provided by an early speech by the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff. She <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/17/brazil-president-snub-us-nsa\">cancelled a state visit to the US</a> in protest at revelations that the National Security Agency had been spying on her personal communications and those of her aides.

Last week, our organisation, the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (Agra), released <a href=\"http://www.agra.org/download/5226fe87ea799\" title=\"\">a 204-page report</a> (pdf) into the state of Africa's agriculture. It covered, in detail, the wide range of obstacles and challenges facing African countries as they seek to transform their agricultural productivity, as well as considering what opportunities there are to deliver this ambition.</p><p>Perhaps inevitably, however, our mention of GMOs dominated coverage of the report. We saw headlines such as \"<a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/agra-agribusiness-africa-agriculture/blog/46511/\" title=\"\">Agra helping agribusiness conquer African agriculture</a>\", and accusations that our organisation was promoting \"<a href=\"http://www.modernghana.com/news/488643/1/gmos-genetically-modified-colonialism-the-fear-of-.html\" title=\"\">genetically modified colonialism</a>\".</p><p>With hindsight, we should not have been surprised by this reaction. After all, our report noted how the controversial and complex nature of GMOs can make it incredibly difficult to hold a reasoned debate. It is why companies, organisations and scientists tend, when they can, to steer clear of voicing their opinions on the subject. All fear their position will be exaggerated.</p><p>I also have to acknowledge that the words used by the author of that specific chapter were open to misrepresentation, a mistake we must accept. What they don't do, however, is herald any change in Agra's long-established position on GMOs – a position which, I believe, reflects the cautious and balanced approach needed when considering any new technology.</p><p>GMOs are currently grown in only three countries – South Africa, Burkina Faso and Egypt. The slow adoption of this technology stems from various factors, not least a cautious approach that recognises all technologies come with risks as well as benefits.</p><p>These risks must not be overlooked, particularly as many African countries are still putting in place biosafety regulations – both on paper and in practice. It is no surprise that a number of African governments feel they still lack the capacity to manage GM technology adequately.</p><p>Equally important are the controls that many countries outside our continent have placed on GM crops. These controls have an impact on Africa's current trade and could undermine its potential as a major supplier of food to the rest of the world.</p><p>In the long run, however, Africa – a continent where one in four people still go hungry, and where annual food imports exceed $20bn – must carefully examine the potential of all new technologies to boost food production. This does not mean pushing GMOs or any other technology on reluctant governments or citizens. Agra believes it is the responsibility and prerogative of African governments to determine their position on GMOs.</p><p>But neither does it mean slamming the door shut on discussion, debate or research that might provide real benefits. So why does Agra not fund research, awareness campaigns or the development of GMOs adapted for Africa? We believe there are cheaper, readily available technologies that can effectively help smallholder farmers improve their harvests and yields.</p><p>Through our <a href=\"http://www.agra.org/what-we-do/seed/\" title=\"\">programme for Africa's seed systems</a>, we are supporting the development of improved crop varieties – developed through conventional breeding methods – of key food crops, such as maize, cassava and beans.Importantly, we are also making sure that when these improved crops are developed, they find themselves in the hands of African farmers.</p><p>We are working with 16 national research institutes and farmers across Africa to develop seeds suited to our continent's varied environments. We are supporting the development of local entrepreneurs and companies who can distribute these seeds, along with fertiliser and other technologies, and helping to improve access to finance so that farmers can buy them.</p><p>These initiatives are making a difference. Last year, schemes supported by Agra produced enough seed of improved varieties to plant an estimated 3.85m hectares (9.6m acres). Throughout the continent, the adoption of our new varieties – none of which are genetically modified − is leading to record yields. For example, a recent study of an improved variety of maize seed in Kenya has shown yields increasing by a third.</p><p>We are seeing real progress across the continent; for the time being, therefore, our focus will remain on conventional breeding methods. For better or for worse, depending on who you ask, GMOs are unlikely to impact African food security in the near future. In the meantime, we need to have an informed, dispassionate conversation that includes all parties.</p><p></p><p><em>• Jane Karuku is president of the </em><a href=\"http://www.agra.org\" title=\"\"><em>Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/9/17/1379420947658/GM-crops-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/sep/17/food-security-gm","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/sep/17/food-security-gm","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Inside the 20 September edition","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-17T13:43:47Z","sectionId":"theguardian","id":"theguardian/2013/sep/17/inside-guardian-weekly-abby-deveney","fields":{"body":"<p>Home is the new away.

Price is set by the market. Value needs to be assessed and determined. This is worth bearing in mind as we consider the value of water – for it is worth far more than what we pay for it.</p><p>All sorts of factors influence water prices: supply and demand, technology and regulation. Determining value is more challenging, especially in many developing countries where water is regarded as priceless.</p><p>As the world's population swells, climate change intensifies and water usage by agriculture and industry continues to increase, water demand grows. It is estimated that by 2030 demand will outstrip the capacity of existing infrastructure <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/client_service/sustainability/latest_thinking/charting_our_water_future\" title=\"\">by about 40%</a>, rising to over 50% in rapidly developing countries. A whopping <a href=\"http://www.morganstanleyfa.com/public/projectfiles/4d1056d8-af1a-4925-b68f-5871ad26d67b.pdf\" title=\"\">£13tn of investment</a> is needed in the world's pipelines, storage and treatment plants to keep pace.</p><p>\"It is this infrastructure renewal need that will drive the economics for water pricing,\" Dr Zafar Adeel, director of the <a href=\"http://inweh.unu.edu\" title=\"\">UN Institute for Water, Environment and Health</a>, told me <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/water-footprint-labels-consumer-products\" title=\"\">a couple of weeks ago</a>. \"The only way you can recover it is by costing water to the full extent of what it takes to produce it: to treat it, to pump it, to deliver it to the doorstep of the consumer.\"</p><p>But this creates a huge dilemma for the developing world. For example, in July the World Bank loaned Kenya £97m to pay for new water infrastructure such as an <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-19/kenya-gets-155-million-in-world-bank-financing-for-water.html\" title=\"\">irrigation scheme on the Lower Nzoia river</a>. This lifeline will give local farmers a stable source of water. However, it also pushes up the cost of water.</p><p>In the west, passing this cost on to business might put a break on profits, but in the developing world rising water rates could render agricultural industries uncompetitive or laden them with unsustainable debt.</p><p>This cuts to a critical issue. Who should bear the cost of delivering water through the supply chain? Consumers in advanced economies, multinational businesses, or developing country suppliers and their populations?</p><p>\"It is a very, very tricky issue,\" says Adeel. \"In developing countries [the reaction to water pricing is to] say 'this is just a conspiracy to deprive us of water by making it so expensive that we can't afford it'.\"</p><p>Access to safe drinking water is now regarded <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Right_to_water\" title=\"\">as a basic human right</a>, enshrined by the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council, and yet 783 million people – 11% of the world's population – are <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/water/\" title=\"\">still living without it</a>.</p><p>The idea is that we must now consider the social value of water and not simply surrender it to the highest bidder.</p><p>Sure, the free hand of the market allows for price discovery and investments in infrastructure. Its principles even <a href=\"http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/VirtualWaterFlows\" title=\"\">underpin virtual water trading</a>. But is it better for a litre of African water to go not to the village in the valley nearby, but to a farm growing lettuce for European supermarkets? Consider also that a source of water can have spiritual significance to local communities. Is it right to privatise this?</p><p>The sensitivity of the issue was underlined earlier this year after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyAzxmN2s0w&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">a video</a> emerged of Nestlé's chairman, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, appearing to say that it is \"extreme\" to regard water as a public right. \"Water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value,\" he said.</p><p>Faced with a storm of controversy, Nestlé, the world's leading bottled water seller, <a href=\"http://www.nestle.com/aboutus/ask-nestle/answers/nestle-chairman-peter-brabeck-letmathe-believes-water-is-a-human-right\" title=\"\">clarified that the chairman</a> does, in fact, believe water for drinking and hygiene to be a human right. Brabeck-Letmathe explained in an interview with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/joconfino\" title=\"\">Jo Confino</a> in February that Nestlé simply thinks that a market value should be placed on the \"98.5% of the water\" that, it says, is not directly used by humans. This raises some important questions. Should we subsidise the water that is valuable for humans and allow the market to set the price for the excess? What about the water that is essential to animals and the environment? What price should it fetch?</p><p>Last October, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) challenged companies to take water valuation seriously, launching a report <a href=\"http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/EDocument/EDocumentDetails.aspx?ID=15099&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true\" title=\"\">Water Valuation: Building the Business Case</a>. Peter Bakker, the WBCSD president, called on the business community to \"start tackling this issue, accounting for the real value of the water they are using, and to do it now, before it is too late.\"</p><p>Getting business to pay attention is, however, only the first priority. Determining the \"true\" value of water at all stages in the supply chain is essential if we are to price it correctly and ensure that nobody – and no country – is shortchanged.</p><h2>Tell us what you think</h2><p>We'd like to know your thoughts on water valuation specifically in developing countries so please leave a comment below or tweet us <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianSustBiz\" title=\"\">@GuardianSustBiz</a>.</p><p><strong>Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

The hangar-like space boasts table football, a coffee bar and an ambience that is more Seattle than African savannah.</p><p>Amid the eager people huddled over laptops and tablets is the towering figure of Erik Hersman, with his bald head and reddish beard. Known to most Kenyans online as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whiteafrican\" title=\"https://twitter.com/whiteafrican\">@WhiteAfrican</a>, the American, who grew up in East Africa, has become one of the most effective evangelists for the technological future of his adopted country.</p><p>The co-founder of both the iHub and <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\">Ushahidi</a>, software, which has been used from Haiti to New Zealand to crowd-source information and map crises, wants to challenge the notion of Africa being a single entity blighted by wars and famine.</p><p>\"In the US I still get asked if they (Africans) have computers and mobile phones,\" he says.</p><p>When it comes to phones and Kenya, they certainly do. Six years ago the leading local telecom firm, <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\" title=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\">Safaricom</a>, noticed that its customers were sending mobile phone airtime to each other in lieu of cash. They decided to formalise this, calling it M-Pesa, from the Swahili for \"cash\", and enable subscribers to deposit money into a mobile account that they could then send to others or pay for things. Simple and text based, it worked on the most basic phones.</p><p>Today, Safaricom has almost as many subscribers as Kenya has adults and M-Pesa is used for everything from paying electricity bills and school fees to sending money to relatives upcountry. Cash equivalent to nearly one-third of Kenya's GDP [US$37.2bn in 2012] washed through the money-transfer service last year.</p><p>That success has given Kenya a global reputation as an outlier in the mobile money sector, while the impact of Ushahidi means that Nairobi is now looked to for software innovation.</p><p>This has been Africa's \"mobile decade\"; there are 74 mobile phones for every 100 Kenyans and, of those who access the internet, 99% do it via a mobile device.</p><p>The challenge, says Hersman, will be ensuring that \"five or 10 years from now Nairobi is Africa's tech hub\", ahead of the more populous Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city, or South Africa's wealthier Cape Town. There are signs everywhere that this is happening. Along the corridor in the same building as the iHub is a new office for the <a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/\" title=\"http://www.gsma.com/\">GSMA, the global telecoms trade association</a>.</p><p>Its  executive director, Anne Bouverot, says \"the rapid pace of mobile adoption has delivered an explosion of innovation and huge economic benefits\" and has pumped £20bn into the sub-Saharan African economy. She believes the mobile industry could also fuel the creation of nearly 15 million new jobs by 2020.</p><p>Much of that innovation is likely to happen within a few blocks of the iHub, an area now dubbed the \"silicon savannah\". Down Nairobi's busy Ngong Road two more tech hubs have been set up: <a href=\"http://www.88mph.ac/\" title=\"http://www.88mph.ac/\">\"88mph\", a seed fund and incubator</a>, and Innovation 4 Africa, a similar venture that shares the same space. A venture capital outfit, looking to invest in startups, called the Savannah Fund, in which Hersman is a partner, has opened above a fashionable bar on the same road.</p><p>And it's not just the locals who are interested in Nairobi. From the balcony of the iHub you can see an impressive new tower block that has sprung up to house the IBM Innovation Centre, the firm's first research lab in Africa. Fellow tech giants Intel, Nokia, Google and Microsoft are already in the city.</p><p>Sceptics have begun to ask where are the other success stories to rival M-Pesa but <a href=\"http://www.globalshapers.org/shapers/phares-kariuki\" title=\"http://www.globalshapers.org/shapers/phares-kariuki\">Phares Kariuki</a>, who left the world of banking to mentor entrepreneurs, says they are looking in the wrong place.</p><p>\"In Kenya everyone's opening a mobile venture trying to solve a problem that nobody has,\" says Kariuki.</p><p>Rather than smartphone apps for the small base of affluent consumers, the boom is happening in software that enables companies to do business.</p><p>These ventures are boring by comparison but are part of the reason why Kenya's export of technology-related services exploded from £11m in 2002 to £240m by 2010. Current estimates put that figure at more than £300m.</p><p>There is still a danger that the hype might suffocate innovation. While the Kenyan government deserves credit for delivering the undersea broadband cables that have helped internet access to treble since 2009, the tech boom has been largely a private enterprise.</p><p>The authorities are pinning their strategy on a site 40 miles outside Nairobi called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konza_Technology_City\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konza_Technology_City\">Konza Techno City</a>,  which boosters claim will turn the scrubland into a futuristic business district.

More importantly the annual recharge rate, the amount of water that can be sustainably exploited per year, is estimated to 3.4 billion cubic meters, nearly three times the water use in the New York City. </p><p>The man behind the RTI is the energetic white haired French Alain Gachet who says the worst thing he has ever seen in his life is people dying of thirst.<br /> </p><blockquote><p> \"This discovery will transform Turkana. In 10 years time I see no more suffering, no more dying of hunger or thirst, people will have schools, roads, farms. Life will be much better for them and famine will be a thing go the past\". </p></blockquote><p>For Turkana where malnutrition rates can be as high as 37%, this discovery Is better than oil.  It is an opportunity for local development. </p><p>Ikal Angelei is the Director of <a href=\"www.friendsoflaketurkana.org/‎\">Friends of Lake Turkana</a>, an organzation that champions the rights of the Lake's communities and ensure their involvement in decision-making on issues relating to the Lake and its environment.</p><blockquote><p>\"This is an extremely exciting find for my community. While we celebrate however, we must be wise. The first thing we must do is confirm the recharge rate so that we do not kill the golden goose, and we  must also protect against speculators and unscrupulous people who threaten to take it away from the  local communities.  The Kenyan leadership must plan carefully to ensure that in developing the resource we protect and respect the rights and the needs of local communities who must benefit.\" </p></blockquote><p>Many will celebrate that the immediate benefit of this find will be no more famine for a community that has suffered repeated droughts. Kenyans are still haunted by images of starving children in 2009/10 during the worst drought in over 60 years that affected more than 10 million people in the Horn of Africa. </p><p>Richard Leakey, Chairman of the Turkana Basin Institute is not surprised with the find.</p><blockquote><p>\"This discovery confirms what we have always believed. This area is an ancient lake bed, the water had to have gone somewhere. This is also the cradle of mankind and I hope that finally the importance of Turkana for Kenya and the world will finally be recognized\" </p></blockquote>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2013/sep/11/1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/africa-wild/2013/sep/11/1","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Kenya water discovery brings hope for drought relief in rural north","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-10T23:01:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2013/sep/11/kenya-water-discovery-drought-relief","fields":{"body":"<p>Two vast underground aquifers, storing billions of litres of water, have been discovered in the poorest and least developed area of Kenya.</p><p>The finds, in Turkana county in the north west, were uncovered using new technology to interpret ground-penetrating radar from satellites. Professor Judy Wakhungu, appointed minister of environment, water and natural resources in April, described the find as extremely significant. \"It is not too deep and ought not to be not too expensive to develop,\" she added.</p><p>Wakhungu said Kenya plans to use the technology to map the entire country: \"We are excited to be able to provide a national map of the country's water resources.\"</p><p>The barren semi-desert Turkana region is home to about 700,000 people. Most live off their herds of camels, goats and sheep. Temperatures rarely fall below 30C and water is scarce. \"Many people have to live on around 10 litres of water a day,\" said Brian McSorley, Oxfam's water expert in Nairobi. \"This is half the minimum daily requirement.\"</p><p>The aquifers could change the lives of people in the region. One, close to the main town of Lodwar, is said to have a proven reserve of 10 billion cubic metres of fresh water. The other, the Lotikipi basin, further north, towards the Sudanese border, is even larger, holding at least 200 billion cubic metres of water.</p><p>These aquifers are being recharged from the surrounding plains and hills, an area of 21,000 sq km, The study indicates it is being replenished at a rate of 1.2 billion cubic metres a year – more than enough to supply the entire county.</p><p>The UN scientific and cultural organisation, Unesco, backed a France-based company, Radar Technologies, founded by Alain Gachet, which began the search for the water in November. Gachet, who cut his teeth as an exploration geologist in the oil industry, developed the Watex technology to interpret radar and oil exploration data in order to explore for water.</p><p>\"We processed imagery from the pace shuttle,\" Gachet said. \"This allowed us to build up a detailed surface map. Then we interpreted radar imagery from the Japanese space agency and deep seismic data from the oil industry. With this approach, we were able to peel back the surface of the earth like an onion.\"</p><p>Among his first customers was the UN refugee agency. At the height of the Darfur crisis, the technology helped supply the refugee camps that sprang up in the desolate regions of eastern Chad, as people streamed across the border to escape the war.</p><p>The technology produces detailed maps indicating where water has accumulated deep beneath the surface. Test wells are then drilled to validate the findings. This has been done in Turkana and water was found less than 50 metres from the surface. As drilling progressed to a depth of 330 metres, three layers of the aquifer were discovered.</p><p>\"They are like a series of interconnected pancakes,\" said Casey Walther, a water expert who was a consultant with Unesco on the project, and now works with Gachet. \"Water flows between the layers.\"</p><p>McSorley said when he heard of the study he checked the technical possibility of using radar imaging with Oxfam's experts in the UK. \"The concept is not revolutionary, but the science is good,\" he added.</p><p>But getting the water to the scattered people of Turkana will be no easy matter. This is among the most remote and lawless regions of Kenya. There are sporadic raids from neighbouring Uganda, Sudan and Ethiopia. Drought and disputes over livestock have plagued the area for generations. The Turkana, Samburu and Pokot people have traditionally engaged in cattle raids, but in recent years these have increased in intensity, leaving many dead.</p><p>Oxfam gave a cautious welcome to the finds. McSorley believes the real test will be whether the infrastructure will be installed to allow the water to reach local people. He has been working at the giant Dadaab refugee camp in north-eastern Kenya for years. This lies close to another giant aquifer, but getting access to the water is not easy.</p><p>\"Groundwater resources here are not an issue but many of the surrounding communities still lack a borehole or the pumps to access it,\" he said. \"Those that do cannot always afford the fuel to operate the generator to power the pump or have the cash to service and maintain the equipment.\"</p><p>Turkana lies just south of the Ilemi triangle, a disputed border region, whose exact boundaries have never been agreed upon by neighbouring states. Quarrels over where the border runs began during the colonial period and continue to this day.</p><p>Attempting to police this remote region has been expensive. In the 1920s, British officials in Kenya and Sudan attempted to pass responsibility to one another to escape bearing the cost of the operation. The result was a dotted border running between the countries, leaving plenty of room for disputes.</p><p>Angela Docherty, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.newways.org.uk/about-us/Where-we-work.aspx\" title=\"\">New Ways</a>, one of the few charities working in the Ilemi triangle, says poverty breeds these skirmishes. \"All conflicts relate to scarcity of resources. Everyone is trying to survive.\"</p><p>Concern has increased in recent years, as oil finds have crept closer to the disputed border. The UK-based Tullow Oil company has been drilling in the area and found signs of oil in the Lokichar basin, south of Lodwar. The reserves are not yet proven, but if the region has oil and water, international attention is certain to be focused on the area.</p><p>Asked whether the combination of poorly defined borders and these important resources could raise difficulties for Kenya. Wakhungu told the Guardian that all the country's borders have issues with transboundary water. \"We manage these very carefully, but I can't worry about the diplomacy. My brief is to look at the water resources.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/9/10/1378830689632/MDG--gridmap-Turkana-grou-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/11/kenya-water-discovery-drought-relief","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/sep/11/kenya-water-discovery-drought-relief","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"How working with open data can help your charity do incredible things","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-10T06:00:16Z","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","id":"voluntary-sector-network/2013/sep/10/charity-voluntary-sector-open-data","fields":{"body":"<p>Open data, big data, raw data: if you only have a vague idea of what these are or how they are relevant to your organisation, then you're not alone.</p><p>As the <a href=\"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/Open%20Data%20and%20Charities.pdf\" title=\"\">Open Data and Charities report</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Nominet Trust</a> puts it, \"The understanding, use and publishing of open data within the third sector is still very much in its infancy.

Each waft sends a cloud of toxic vapour into the faces of children and adults as they gather to watch.</p><p>The burning of mercury is a common sight in the streets, homes and cottage-industry mines throughout east Africa. The liquid metal is used to extract the gold and then vaporised to leave behind flakes of the precious metal.</p><p>But in this dangerous industry, seeds of a gold revolution are being sown: Fairtrade International announced this week that up to 12 mines in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya are on course to sell Africa's first ethical gold within a year.</p><p>There are no official figures for how many Tanzanians are poisoned by mercury fumes, but accounts of memory problems, sickness and impaired vision are common in the small mines that litter the countryside. The sight of open mercury poisoning may seem shocking, but it is just one of a host of appalling working conditions that blights the production of gold throughout east Africa.</p><p>Tanzania is Africa's fourth largest gold producer. About  15 million people work in mines – many illegal, small-scale and unlicensed – producing about 200 to 300 tonnes a year. Most miners work 24-hour shifts without basic safety helmets, boots or goggles in fragile mines with little or no timber supports.</p><p>On the surface, the ore is crushed by women using hammers or mortars, sometimes with babies on their knees. In some mines, cyanide is used to remove gold from low-grade ore. Like mercury, it is highly toxic. Mercury and cyanide pollution into rivers is common and, according to <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/28/tanzania-hazardous-life-child-gold-miners\" title=\"\">a report last week by Human Rights Watch</a>, child labour is rife.</p><p>But the Fairtrade scheme could herald a change. Under a three-year scheme funded by Comic Relief, the mines are changing working practices – banning children, enforcing health and safety rules and preventing toxic run off – in the hope that shoppers in Europe, Asia and America will be prepared to pay more for \"green gold\".</p><p>In return they will get a fairer price for their gold and a Fairtrade premium that can be invested in mines, education, childcare and community groups.</p><p>At the Ilani mine near Nyarugusu, in the northwest of Tanzania, the appropriately named Golden Hainga has already barred children from his mine and processing areas, and runs a crèche. Open burning of mercury is banned and personal protection equipment is compulsory.</p><p>Lufta Weja, 30, has worked at the mine for five months. \"The main difference between other mines is health and safety,\" he said. \"It's the first time I've had a helmet – in other mines we had no helmets, or gloves or boots.\"</p><p>A few miles from the Ilani mine, Renatus Nsangano has also been working with Fairtrade to improve working conditions. But change is slow. His mine suffers from a chronic lack of capital and cash flow, and is vulnerable to the low prices paid by local gold brokers.</p><p></p><p>\"My dream is to be able to use the technology that was used in Tanzania 50 years ago,\" said Nsangano.</p><p>\"But we thank God for Fairtade because it has lifted us from one level to another. We have put in wooden steps to get to the bottom of the mine. We no longer burn mercury in the open and we ensure that waste water from the mine doesn't contaminate the environment.\"</p><p>To get Fairtrade certification, gold mines will have to ban mercury burning in the open – as well as ensure that no children work in the mines. Other details are still under discussion.</p><p>In South America, which began to sell Fairtrade gold two years ago, miners receive a minimum price of 95% of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) price for their gold. That price is higher than they would normally get from selling to local brokers.</p><p>As well as fair working conditions and pay, the miners also get a Fairtrade premium of $2,000 (£1,283) per kg of fine gold. The premium has to be invested into the local community.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416606105'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/9/5/1378395261414/Fairtrade-gold--009.jpg' alt='Fairtrade gold ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Fairtrade and Fairmined gold hallmarked in London. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</figcaption></figure><p>Africa's mines are still at least a year away from getting that status, according to Fairtrade's local advisers.</p><p>Key to the success of African ethical gold will be improving efficiency to create a steady stream of precious metal. Just 40% of the gold is currently recovered from the ore – a figure that could be 80% with better technology.  Fairtrade also needs to build a supply chain to ensure that gold gets to suppliers in Europe, Asia and America.</p><p></p><p>Harriet Lamb, director of Fairtrade International, said: \"Fairtrade is not something where you can click your fingers and magically start paying farmers and miners, but they have started to tackle the problems.</p><p>\"It's a long process of change and we are under no illusions. But having seen the conditions of the miners it has only steeled my determination to make this work. It is shocking that people finding gold – a precious metal so valued – are working in such terrible conditions.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/9/5/1378394566136/Gold-mining-in-Geita-Tanz-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/06/fairtrade-gold-africa-mining","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/06/fairtrade-gold-africa-mining","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"GM crops: African opposition is a farce, says group led by Kofi Annan","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-05T06:00:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/2013/sep/05/africa-gm-genetically-modified-crops","fields":{"body":"<p>Concern in Africa over genetically modified crops has been dismissed as fear of the unknown by an environmental group chaired by Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general.</p><p>A report by the <a href=\"http://www.agra.org/\" title=\"\">Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa</a> (Agra), published on Wednesday, describes opposition to GM crops as \"a farce\".

Unless milled, the import of GM foods is banned in Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. More important to seed-sector development, these bans signal the arbitrariness and unpredictability of public policy.\"</p><p>Agra is an independent organisation based in Kenya that aims to double the income of 20 million small farmers and reduce food insecurity by 50% in 20 countries by 2020. Critics of the group accuse it of showing its true colours after initial coyness over GM foods.</p><p>\"This report clearly indicates their full support for GM crops, and their intention to use their influence to open African doors for Monsanto's and Syngenta's patented GM crops,\" said Teresa Anderson, international advocacy co-ordinator for the <a href=\"http://www.gaiafoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Gaia foundation</a>, an advocate of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jun/17/la-via-campesina-henry-saragih\" title=\"\">food sovereignty</a> that asserts the right of people to define their own food systems.</p><p>\"Characterising the refusal of most African countries to commercialise GM crops …  as 'fear of the unknown' is patronising and shallow. Agra has wilfully chosen to insult farmers' concerns in their aim to expand corporate agribusiness into Africa.\"</p><p>The Agra report urges African countries to further invest in agricultural research and development to ensure food security amid concern that some nations are lagging behind. \"In terms of personnel engaged in agricultural research, Africa has the world's lowest capacity, with only 70 researchers per million inhabitants (compared with the US and Japan with 2,640 and 4,380, respectively),\" it says.</p><p>It notes that smallholder farm yields fall short of the estimated potential for most food crops (cereals and pulses). The average grain yields remained at about one-third to half of the world's average (1.1-1.5 tonnes per hectare versus 3.2 tonnes per hectare) between 2000 and 2010. Sub-Saharan Africa has the greatest gaps between potential yields and realised yields for several crops, particularly maize and rice.</p><p>\"Plausible explanations for the low yields include lack of access to quality resources such as water, inputs and low use of new technologies that require money – such as fertiliser, machinery and irrigation technology,\" the report says. \"The development and dissemination of new technologies and practices that increase yield potential for a particular area depend on a country's ability to make needed investments, and farmers' skills and willingness to adopt the technologies.\"</p><p>Anderson said the key was quality, not quantity, of research, and questioned the approach of most agriculture research institutes. \"They are usually focused on producing a few varieties that claim to address individual (not complex) issues,\" she said. \"Farmers are advised to grow these new varieties instead of their traditional crops. What we are clearly seeing as a result is that seed diversity is disappearing in Africa, while communities complain that the new varieties are tasteless, lack nutrition, or are more vulnerable to particular pests.\"</p><p>The report coincides with a meeting in Maputo, Mozambique, of the African green revolution forum, organised by Agra. The focus of the talks – which bring together heads of state, ministers, NGOs and scientists – is \"scaling up and financing inclusive agribusiness through transformative public private partnerships\".</p><p>The forum takes place 10 years after 40 African countries, convened by the African Union, signed the <a href=\"http://www.nepad.org/nepad/knowledge/doc/1787/maputo-declaration\" title=\"\">Maputo declaration</a>, committing at least 10% of their national budgets to agriculture development.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/1/5/1325763611673/Genetically-Modified-Agri-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/05/africa-gm-genetically-modified-crops","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/sep/05/africa-gm-genetically-modified-crops","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Curbing deforestation in the developing world","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-30T16:23:09Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network/crown-agents-partner-zone","id":"global-development-professionals-network/crown-agents-partner-zone/curbing-deforestation-in-the-developing-world","fields":{"body":"<p>Preserving environmental resources significantly benefits those living in the developing world, yet natural resources like forests and water supplies continue to suffer depletion and pollution – disproportionately affecting the world's poorest people.</p><p>Experts estimate that half of the world's rainforests were destroyed in the last 50 years alone, with South America and Africa experiencing the largest net losses of forest areas in the developing world between 2000 and 2010, <a href=\"http://See: http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1757e/i1757e.pdf\" title=\"\">according to the United Nations</a> (pdf).</p><p>These conditions can further exacerbate the situation of people already living in poverty, as forests play a crucial role in preserving water systems, preventing soil erosion and providing a habitat for unique wildlife. They also counter global warming by acting as 'carbon sinks', with the carbon stored in forests estimated to be around 50% more than the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Deforestation releases this carbon into the atmosphere which has severe implications for global warming and climate change.</p><p>Assistance from a number of developed countries aims to counter these effects. In Japan, where forest conservation is a top priority for official development assistance, funding has gone to a number of forest preservation programmes helping nations to better manage and preserve their forests. The programmes are particularly focused on helping to map and survey forestry resources to help eligible developing nations calculate the carbon inventory their forests contain, in turn allowing them to seek financial compensation through the UN's Redd and Redd+ schemes for preserving forests.</p><p>The UN programme compensates eligible developing countries for preserving their forests and preventing the release of the carbon stored within them but receiving the credits requires a level of detail in reporting and mapping that many developing nations to not have the capacity to produce. Countries entering the Redd initiative must also produce a land use, land use change and forestry assessments, which form part of the baseline used to monitor changes to the forest resources and carbon emissions.</p><p>Japan has assisted a number of countries by providing equipment, expertise and technology, including Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Costa Rica, Bolivia, and Cote d'Ivoire. The projects, administered by Crown Agents as a procurement agent, differ depending on each country's needs. The major focus, however, is often providing the necessary technical equipment and expertise for countries to be able to better manage their resources.</p><p>In Ghana, for example, where forests are estimated to cover a third of the country's land mass and are increasingly under threat from urban encroachment and illegal logging, the government of Japan provided a grant to help the Forestry Commission of Ghana in their mission to preserve the country's forests. Crown Agents worked closely with FCG to facilitate land use, land use change and forestry surveys using Lidar surveys and satellite images to help map the forest cover.</p><p>This, with vehicles, tools and IT equipment procured to conduct field surveys and analyse the resulting data, in turn facilitated the measurement of the forests' carbon levels by the FCG, with technical support from Japanese consultants, to prepare a request for financial support from the UN Redd+ programme, which would be the first application of its kind in the West Africa sub-region. These efforts are helping to secure funding to preserve Ghana's forests and protect the wider environment.</p><p>It is hoped that these projects will make a significant and lasting contribution by preserving some of the world's critical forest cover, combating climate change and helping developing nations maintain the natural resources that allow for a healthy environment.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKLxu036-JY\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKLxu036-JY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p><strong>This content is produced and controlled by Crown Agents</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/30/1377879548437/Mangrove-forest-Junquilla-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/crown-agents-partner-zone/curbing-deforestation-in-the-developing-world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/crown-agents-partner-zone/curbing-deforestation-in-the-developing-world","sectionName":"Crown Agents partner zone"},{"webTitle":"Live Q&amp;A: water in agriculture","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-30T13:41:19Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/aug/30/water-agriculture-irrigation-methods-live-chat","fields":{"body":"<p>Irrigation, put simply, is the term used for applying water to soil (or, put very simply, watering plants).</p><p>Since rainfall and river flow have been <a href=\"http://best.berkeley.edu/~mesa/comm/group_1/louis.html\" title=\"\">unpredictable and limited</a> since prehistoric times, different forms of irrigation have been used for thousands of years to grow crops.</p><p>We've come a long way since <a href=\"http://www.irrigationmuseum.org/item1.aspx?id=17\" title=\"\">the first canals were built by ancient Egyptians</a> during the 'dawn of civilisation' to divert flood waters from the River Nile to fields.

From a single, brightly decorated room, she was prescribing medicines and administering basic care that patients might otherwise have to walk 15 miles or more to reach.</p><p>It was late evening and she looked tired. A handful of patients were still waiting anxiously to be seen and my eyes were drawn to a very young child clinging to an elderly lady – probably the grandmother. The scene took me straight back to my childhood years, growing up in a Kenyan village, and I hoped this child would survive, thrive and realise her full potential for Rwanda.</p><p>Thanks to the efforts of dedicated frontline health workers affiliated to organisations such as the One Family Health Foundation, she just might. This private enterprise model enables local nurses to own and operate medical clinics, bringing basic healthcare services to rural communities across Rwanda while also enabling them to earn enough to support their families.</p><p>The clinic I visited is just one of a network that is being established by nurses in this way and shows what can be achieved if we think creatively about how to improve access to health in developing countries. Innovation – coming up with fresh ways of overcoming the challenges we meet in these locations – as well as working in partnership with others is key to making healthcare for all a reality.</p><p>Often it is not brilliant academics but those living and breathing a challenge that have the best solutions.</p><p>A decade ago, I was working as a physician in Kenya, treating conditions that are all too common in children, such as pneumonia, malnutrition and severe malaria. In the face of resistance – and some prejudice – I also set up an HIV clinic in Kilifi, one of Kenya's poorest districts, to improve access to antiretrovirals.</p><p>Those years were hugely rewarding, but tough. They made me realise that if we were to truly change the face of access to healthcare, we would need to think bigger. We would need to change the system.</p><p>As a result, I took the difficult decision to leave my patients and in 2005 joined GlaxoSmithKline. I hoped this move would provide me with a platform to advocate for the changes to the healthcare system that my patients so desperately needed.</p><p>Eight years on, progress has been made but there is still plenty more to be done. The kind of issues we face, from fighting malaria to addressing malnutrition, are not challenges that any one organisation can tackle alone. Only by combining the skills and experience of different organisations, charities, governments – by collaborating as we innovate – can we drive genuine social change.</p><p>Part of my role involves developing these partnerships. One example is our recent collaboration struck with Save the Children. Launched in May, the aim is to bring together different types of expertise to help save the lives of one million children.</p><p>Nearly seven million children under five die each year from preventable diseases and, despite some improvement in the reduction of child mortality rates, more needs to be done. With Save the Children, we want to address areas that need urgent attention: developing child-friendly medicines to reduce child mortality and newborn deaths; improving access to vaccines and medicines; and the supply of simple, nutritious food.</p><p>Our partnership is already in action. We are working on programmes in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya; and we are finding ways of combining GSK's science with Save the Children's on-the-ground experience. For example, we are reformulating an antiseptic commonly used in mouthwash into a gel for cleansing the umbilical cord stump of newborn babies. This has the potential to prevent thousands of deaths from infection during a baby's first few weeks.</p><p>This is just one example of using technology differently to tackle challenges in developing countries. Another is our collaboration with Vodafone. Together with the company and other partners, we are piloting a mobile-phone based programme in Mozambique. If successful, it could increase the proportion of children covered by vaccination in Mozambique by an additional 5-10%. Ideas include helping health workers to check a child's vaccination history on the spot by using the parent's mobile phone number.</p><p>Across the private sector, there are other great examples of companies thinking differently about how they work in developing and emerging markets. Coca-Cola has improved its water use efficiency in India, a country which has over 17% of the world's population but less than 4% of the world's freshwater resources. Consumer goods business Unilever is working with local farmers in Indonesia to boost livelihoods from growing black soybeans, a key ingredient.</p><p>There is much work still to be done, but partnerships hold promise. Not only do they take us a step closer to making sure safe, effective healthcare is finally within everyone's reach. They also harness the innovation, technology and creative thinking that could enable healthcare in developing countries to not just match that of the developed world, but surpass it.</p><p><em>Allan Pamba is director of public engagement and access initiatives in GlaxoSmithKline's developing countries unit.

Across the continent, national governments and <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21951811~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:258644,00.html\" title=\"\">regional planners have never had the data</a> to make proper decisions regarding investment in water resources infrastructure, essential to increase agricultural capacity sustainably.</p><p>The main obstacle is Africa's extremely <a href=\"ftp://ftp.wmo.int/Documents/PublicWeb/mainweb/meetings/cbodies/governance/tc_reports/english/pdf/CBS_XIV_Activ_rep_en.pdf\" title=\"\">limited hydro-meteorological observation network</a>. With more measurement stations, and thus better understanding of water availability, and enhanced ability to predict shifting weather patterns, the impact on African harvest predictions and food production could be transformative.</p><p>The limited number of measurement stations reflects their expense (approximately $15,000 each). When confronted with a choice between building a school or a weather station, public authorities often choose the former. In addition, a traditional weather station needs local availability of technically skilled staff, a significant problem – especially in rural areas.</p><p>It is clear that new models of data collection are necessary that are – technically, socio-economically, and financially – more sustainable. To this end, Delft University of Technology is leading a public-private consortium, comprising 14 universities and several small and large businesses, to pioneer the <a href=\"http://www.tahmo.org\" title=\"\">Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observator</a>y (Tahmo) network .</p><p>Tahmo is committed to advancing open exchange of hydro-meteorological data from the network. All raw data collected will be freely available for scientific research and government use under the World Meteorological Organisation's <a href=\"http://www.wmo.int/pages/about/Resolution40.html)\" title=\"\">guidance</a>.</p><p>Excitingly, Tahmo offers the prospect of cost-effective hydro-meteorological measuring stations that are low maintenance.  The stations will cost only $500, but will be technologically innovative by deploying low-cost sensors (as found in objects ranging from washing machines to cars and smart phones) marshalled to serve as weather or water sensors. For instance, the simple piezo buzzer (costing $1), which is used in fire alarms, will be used to measure rainfall intensity. Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.delta.tudelft.nl/article/come-to-think-of-it-smart-cheap-tags-for-plant-pots/21628\" title=\"\">RFID tags</a> ($0.10) will be used to measure soil moisture.</p><p>The Tahmo network will be made of 20,000 stations in sub-Saharan Africa; one at each point of a 35km grid. The stations will measure <a href=\"http://tahmo.info/current-african-climate-data\" title=\"\">standard variables</a>, such as air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, and radiation. In addition, they will probably also measure lightning, soil moisture, and atmospheric dust. The stations will be robust, having no moving parts, and require near-zero maintenance.</p><p>Beyond providing free data to the public, the stations (which will most likely be based at secondary schools) will have wider socio-economic benefits for communities. A <a href=\"http://tahmo.info/free-tahmo-course-material-0\" title=\"\">curriculum is being developed</a> to teach children about weather, water, climate, measurement, and computing – <a href=\"http://tahmo.info/educational\" title=\"\">small pilots</a> have already been developed by Delft University in Ghana and by IBM in Kenya.  Schools will also receive, in addition to free teaching materials, a small fee ($200 per year) for station upkeep.</p><p>Central to the success of Tahmo is growing mobile phone coverage through Africa. This network allows for efficient payment of hosting fees through M-Pesa and similar schemes.</p><p>Mobile phones allow for raw communication of data to a central data repository. Sensors have already been electronically integrated by connecting them to a <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\" title=\"\">Raspberry Pi computer</a>.  In turn, the Raspberry Pi can send data over GPRS to a cloud-based interactive <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/intelligent-operations-center/\" title=\"\">data visualisation and management system</a>.  Presently, 12 stations are running in Senegal, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda to test the robustness of this mode of communication.</p><p>This leaves the crucial question of guaranteeing that Tahmo can sustain itself financially. International donors and national governments have a role with start-up costs and institutional facilitation. But, in the long-term, the ambition is for the network to be self-sustaining financially ($5-7m per year). This means that the data collected must also have private sector application.</p><p>Already, IT businesses that provide farmers with information on commodity and input prices have expressed interest in adding weather-based information from Tahmo. Micro-insurance companies also have an obvious use for the data. Presently, such firms are running their own meteo-networks, which is sub-optimal – both financially and from a legal perspective.</p><p>International companies will probably also be interested in obtaining data for hedging purposes for crops such as cotton, cocoa, and coffee. There will also be valuable information for hydropower generation, navigation, flood mitigation, and aviation industries.</p><p>Together with ideas platform, <a href=\"http://www.africagathering.org/\" title=\"\">Africa Gathering</a>, workshops were recently held in Accra and Dakar where young entrepreneurs brainstormed cost models and ways to add value to the gathered data. In September, two winning ideas will be rewarded with start-up grants.</p><p>The funding dimension is just one challenge to Tahmo succeeding in the ambition of constructing a network of 20,000 stations. However, it has real potential to serve as a model to provide Africa with essential weather, water, and climate data. If the creative energy generated so far by the students and young entrepreneurs is any measure of future success, there are grounds for real optimism.</p><p><em>Professor Nick van de Giesen is co-leader of the Tahmo project and Van Kuffeler chair of Water Resources Management at </em><a href=\"http://cookie.tudelft.nl/index.php?action=verify&amp;origin=http://home.tudelft.nl/en/\" title=\"\"><em>Delft University of Technology.</em></a><em> Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nvandegiesen\" title=\"\"><em>@nvandegiesen</em></a><em> on Twitter.</em></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Some, such as the Gates Foundation, don't specifically fund youth employment programmes at all. Meanwhile, Eme Essien Lore, head of <a href=\"http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/our-work/current-work/digital-jobs-africa/digital-jobs-defined\" title=\"\">Digital Jobs Africa</a> for the Rockefeller Foundation, says: \"There is no lack of well-intentioned programmes in the countries we've been working in in Africa, funded by civil society. But there are very few programmes that are very intentional about connecting them with the job opportunities ... or the specific needs of the private sector.\"</p><p>Lore argues that foundations can play a greater role. \"One thing that is unique about private foundations and private philanthropy is our ability to be flexible and adapt. We are not a development organisation, so we can take risks that a development organisations can't.\"</p><p>Jane Sundius, director of education and youth development, for George Soros's <a href=\"http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/\" title=\"\">Open Society Foundations</a>, also believes that \"philanthropy does not have the same kind of reporting requirements that government has. We should have a higher fail rate than other organisations. We should be the ones that are trying things, doing the beta testing.\"</p><p>Reese has seen a lot of this beta testing first-hand, and believes that promising youth employment programmes are emerging: \"The successful components we've seen are that you have to do a labour market study up front. That doesn't have to be some PhD paper, but just to make sure that, if you're training in a region that you are talking to local businesses so that you're clear what type of skills they need today, in six months, and for the next two years. That also buys the businesses in so they provide the internships, apprenticeships, and hands-on training. Teach the kids how to interview and look for a job – the softer skills are often just as important as the technical. And did the people at the end of the course get a job? A lot of job-training programmes never ask that question.\"</p><p>Reese also stresses the importance of public-private partnerships. \"What we try to do is run pilots or exemplary projects that then can be scaled through some sort of visible public-private partnership. We are doing this today with Hilton, Walmart, Microsoft, Caterpillar, with very big companies, so that governments themselves can change the way they are doing some of their vocational training. In turn, that attracts some of the foreign aid money to focus on youth training, job creation, skills matching, creating a platform for business to invest more.\"</p><p>One project that is attempting to pull all these strands together is Rockefeller's Digital Jobs Africa. With a budget of about $100m, beginning in six countries – Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa – the programme focuses on training young people with the digital skills needed for the continent's burgeoning business process outsourcing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_outsourcing\" title=\"\">(BPO)</a> sector, and entry-level technology roles.</p><p>\"These jobs cut across a lot of different sectors,\" says Lore, who is in charge of the seven-year project that launched earlier this year. \"The real growth opportunity is going to be in the thousands of SMEs across Africa that need to have people with these skills to make their businesses more efficient. This is less about technical skills – young people's ability to develop digital skills is actually relatively fast. What they don't have is the other softer skills, the life skills, communication skills, all the things that will make them functional as workers and that will help them navigate the labour force. So we want to focus on training that really combines those two things.\"</p><p>Lore and her team are identifying training providers on the ground, \"who have proven solutions around skilling people up, but maybe not getting the placement rates right\". \"So we will work with them on what needs to happen to change their models. Then we're engaging very directly with the private sector to really understand what their needs are. A young person will hopefully find out relatively quickly – and awareness raising will be a key part of this as well – about these opportunities, and will be able to self-select themselves into a programme. There will be a payment to do that, which we believe is necessary: we've found that, if you give it away, people don't value it as much. And we will use technology platforms to crowd in the voices of young people so that they can help design the process, too.\"</p><p>\"In our conversations in South Africa,\" says Lore, \"there were no organisations we talked to who said, 'Gosh, we need to have more funding for youth development.' Everybody acknowledges that there are so many government programmes that fund youth development and workforce development. There could be more certainly, but the prevailing point of view is that it's not yet being targeted in such a way that it's resulting in getting young people into the workforce. That potential to tilt the balance is something that we want to play a role in.\"</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional.</strong></a><strong> To get more articles like this direct to your inbox, sign up free to become a member of the Global Development Professionals Network.</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/13/1376404699388/Foundations-flexible-resp-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/aug/16/youth-unemployment-foundations-response","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/aug/16/youth-unemployment-foundations-response","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"South-east England has taken 56% of government IT contracts since 2010","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-15T07:26:13Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2013/aug/15/south-east-england-government-it-contracts","fields":{"body":"<p>When the coalition first looked at ways of cutting excessive costs, it didn't take long for them to fix their gaze on IT procurement, long seen as a byword for red tape and shady, excessive, backroom deals.</p><p>Rohan Silver, the former government adviser on Tech City, said he was surprised at how close the relationship between big business and government was and how few government contracts were awarded to small and medium enterprises (SMEs).</p><p>In 2010, 70% of IT contracts went to just seven companies.

As part of its transparency promise, the government developed the '<a href=\"https://online.contractsfinder.businesslink.gov.uk\" title=\"\">Contracts Finder</a>' website, which details all government procurement opportunities, since 2010, over the value of £10,000.</p><h2>Half government IT spend is on firms in the south-east<br /></h2><p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-254601\">ONS</a> there are currently 129,165 IT firms in the UK , of which 32,710 (25%) and 28,785 (22%) are in London and the south east respectively. In the north west there are 9825, the south west houses 10,435, the north east has 1995 and the west midlands plays host to 8515. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have a combined total of 10,175 IT firms. </p><p>Of the 1,034 IT contracts listed on the site, 587 (56%) went to companies in the southeast, of which 264, or 25%, were based in London. The gulf is most striking when you compare those figures to similarly sized tech clusters such as Manchester and Bristol, which have been awarded 21 and 22 contracts respectively.</p><p>Smaller clusters such as Newcastle, Leeds and Birmingham had a total of 50 contracts awarded in the last three years. The remaining contracts were awarded to companies scattered around the UK and other countries, including Ireland, Germany, Holland and Kenya.</p><p>Questioned over London bias, the Cabinet Office deferred to the progress it has made in moving away from the £20bn a year previously being spent on an \"oligopoly\" of large suppliers: \"We've created a more open and competitive marketplace by breaking down the length and size of contracts to no more than £100m, sharing procurement needs earlier and simplifying entry requirements and application procedures – this opens up opportunities to dynamic SMEs and encourages innovation in government IT.</p><p>\"We want to make sure that we get the very best value from every contract, and where long-legacy IT service contracts are still operating, we're reviewing, renegotiating and improving them. Over half a billion pounds was saved last year alone.\"</p><p>The Cabinet Office was also keen to point out that it is making important changes to IT procurement by introducing a system called <a href=\"http://gcloud.civilservice.gov.uk/cloudstore/\" title=\"\">G-Cloud</a>, which was set up with the specific purpose of advertising the government's IT contracts and promoting suppliers.</p><p>\"There are over 800 companies on G-Cloud at the moment – 83% of them SMEs. Sales through CloudStore are increasing across government and 63% of purchases to date have been from SMEs.\"</p><p>The Cabinet Office did not suggest ways in which the government is working to encourage bids from SMEs outside London.</p><h2>\"The hurdles are impossible for SMEs\"<br /></h2><p>Vin Summer, founding director of a Manchester-based software solutions company, <a href=\"http://www.clicksandlinks.com/opencms/opencms/#.UfJucY2siSo\" title=\"\">Clicks and Links</a>, has had numerous problems with attempting to secure government IT contracts both inside a large company and as part of an SME.</p><p>\"I have given up on trying to get government contracts myself because of the difficulties,\" he told the Guardian. \"Despite some attempts at changes, government procurement remains a complex and lengthy process which requires far more time than most SMEs have. The process seems designed to discourage, and the hurdles that you have to jump over – accreditations, accounts, policies, legal documents, etc – are fine for large companies that have departments dedicated to such things, but impossible for SMEs.\"</p><p>He also pointed to \"London-centred thinking\" among government departments and Intellect, the IT trade association he has chosen to leave. \"They are supposed to work together to widen access, rather than protect incumbents. There is little effort to reach out to other locations. Central government seems to also give the impression that the only small tech companies in UK are in Shoreditch – as opposed to Manchester, Salford, Cambridge, Bristol and the rest.\"</p><h2>Where's the government support for local IT firms?<br /></h2><p>Shaun Fensom, founding director of independent trade association, <a href=\"http://www.manchesterdigital.com/\" title=\"\">Manchester Digital</a>, believes that a more bespoke approach is needed to get more non-London IT companies onboard: \"The way procurement is done needs to change. An example is the idea of inviting ideas from SMEs that are not part of the main delivery, but which could lead to savings, efficiency improvements, etc, then selecting the best ideas and funding the SMEs to develop them. This runs in parallel with the main procurement.\"</p><p>Fensom said a group of local digital businesses had discussed the idea of a local procurement event with Liam Maxwell, the government's chief technology officer, which would provide an open forum to discuss the challenges and requirements of government, as well as meet local firms.</p><p>Despite Maxwell's enthusiasm, Fensom says the idea has gone nowhere.</p><p>The coalition was clear about saving money through a less costly procurement process and opening it up to SMEs, which, to its credit, it has done and continues to do so.</p><p>Despite the encouraging rhetoric, the figures still show that many UK IT companies are still struggling to penetrate the London-centric attitude to procurement in central government. Without proper acknowledgment, there is a continued danger that the government is missing out on access to skilled and innovative suppliers.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/8/14/1376486048537/Silicon-Roundabout-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/15/south-east-england-government-it-contracts","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2013/aug/15/south-east-england-government-it-contracts","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Growing biofuels: how to reap rewards","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-14T16:33:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/aug/14/biofuels-sustainable-cultivation","fields":{"body":"<h2><strong>Meghan Sapp, secretary general, </strong><a href=\"http://www.pangealink.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Pangea</strong></a><strong>, Brussels, Belgium. @pangea_link</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Don't expect immediate benefits from biofuels investments, they take a while to show</strong>: Biofuels can have great impacts, but they aren't immediate. That's especially true where infrastructure is weak and investments must start from scratch. In trying to protect the vulnerable, some fail to understand this commercial reality. They expect immediate benefits and if they don't come in less than a year then they damn the project as land-grabbing or a reason for ending all biofuels.</p><p><strong>Meeting sustainability standards should be made less complicated and expensive for developing countries</strong>: Achieving sustainability is good for business because you become more efficient, profitable and competitive as a result. But it's expensive to achieve and to prove by means of certification. Ever changing standards are difficult to apply to developing country circumstances. Helping groups that don't yet achieve sustainability standards is broader than just auditing against a set of criteria in order to get a certificate. More needs to be done in the agricultural production process, primarily but not exclusively, in order to even begin to reach for those standards.</p><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.cleanstarmozambique.com/\" title=\"\">CleanStar Mozambique</a> has developed an integrated supply chain teaching farmers how to improve their yields through agroforestry.

Africa's energy problems go much deeper to questions of basic infrastructure, and are made harder by the fact that there are so many land-locked countries facing high import prices for everything.</p><p><strong>Don't encourage smallholders to plant low-value crops</strong>: One of my concerns with how biofuels is being done in developing countries is the promotion of jatropha to smallholders. It may be easy enough to plant, but don't overlook its low productivity and the lack of readily-usable and valuable co-products (which other edible oilseeds have). I think this plant needs 20 yrs of solid research and development before we can promote it to smallholders, otherwise we're just transferring risk onto those who can least afford it – and have to wait three years before they can get their first poor harvest.</p><h2>Mairon G Bastos Lima, PhD researcher in Brazil, <a href=\"http://www.ivm.vu.nl/\" title=\"\">Institute for Environmental Studies</a>, VU University Amsterdam. @MaironGBL<br /></h2><p><strong>National biodiesel policies are crucial for making programmes sustainable and locally valuable</strong>: Without policies, the equity and sustainability of biofuel production become dependent on the eventual good will of some entrepreneurs. We need to learn from the Nigerian and Brazilian biodiesel policies, which have been limited but has accrued some tangible benefits to small farmers after it demanded features such as mixed food and feedstock cultivation to safeguard food security and the endorsement of a representative social movement or farmer union, to improve their bargaining power face industry. What we still miss are strategies to promote local value.</p><p><strong>A transition to multipurpose agriculture is inevitable</strong>: From an industrial perspective, biomass offers replacements not only for energy but also for a large number of materials today produced from fossil fuels. From a political perspective, biofuel production and biomass-based value-chains offer economic opportunities that agricultural sectors and agriculturally strong countries will simply not forgo. By now more than 50 countries have biofuel policies in place; the issue cannot be reduced to the EU directive. We ought to learn how to make that transition sustainable.</p><p><strong>Support smallholder farmers to move up the value chain</strong>: If we want to talk about equitable agricultural development, we need to see who controls and profits from each stage of the value-chain. So long as small farmers remain only at the bottom, with the least-valuable stage of production, poverty may be alleviated but inequality is maintained. Local capacity building, a term so far missing here, is therefore critical.</p><h2>Richard Bennett, CEO, <a href=\"http://www.sunbirdbioenergy.com/\" title=\"\">Sunbird Bioenergy</a>, London, UK. @Sunbird_Biofuel<br /></h2><p><strong>African countries can learn from Nigeria's clear agricultural policies</strong>: Strong political policy from the Nigerian federal ministry of agriculture and rural development is delivering the country's agricultural transformation agenda that seeks to develop sustainable out-growers programmes, create local wealth and improve living conditions, particularly for women.

One step that would benefit biofuels and other investment projects is to improve the transparency of land tenure conditions and procedures, and the process of making and implementing decisions that underpin that.</p><h2><strong>Rachel Noble, policy researcher, </strong><a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>ActionAid UK</strong></a><strong>, London, UK. @ActionAidUK</strong></h2><p><strong>Biofuels have potential to transform renewable energy if they're sustainable</strong>: Bioenergy through sustainable advanced biofuels could make a small but significant contribution to meeting the 10% renewable energy transport target set by the EU's renewable energy directive. ActionAid calculates this contribution could be about 6% by 2020. However, the sustainability of advanced biofuels is far from guaranteed and member states, including the UK, must put in place sufficient policies and safeguards before we embrace this technology.</p><p><strong>Current EU policies don't address social impacts</strong>: Currently there are no binding social criteria attached to biofuels that can be counted towards EU targets. Countries are only obliged to 'report' on the social impacts. However, research has shown that the current EU biofuels target is driving land-grabbing in developing countries in a context where one in eight people go to bed hungry every night.

Now they are fighting back by attempting to trademark their name and designs.</p><p>Isaac ole Tialolo, a leader and elder, who is also chair of a new organisation, the <a href=\"http://maasaiip.org/\">Maasai Intellectual Property Initiative (MIPI)</a>, has -- together with Washington-based <a href=\"http://www.lightyearsip.net/\">Light Years IP</a>, an NGO which specialises in securing IP rights in developing countries -- been traveling around Maasai regions In Kenya and Tanzania holding meetings and workshops.<br /> <br />If the consultation is successful, the plan is to create a general assembly of Maasai elders, trained in IP, who would act as a legal body negotiating with companies via a licensing agent, in order to enable the ethnic group to develop their economic rights.</p><p>\"I think people need to understand the culture of the others and respect it,\" ole Tialolo told the BBC earlier this year. \"You should not use it to your own benefit, leaving the community, or the owner of the culture, without anything. If you just take what belongs to somebody, and go and display it and have your fortune, then it is very wrong…very wrong.\" </p><p><strong>Commercial use of cultural property</strong></p><p>The key issue here concerns the commercial use of cultural property and the sharing of the benefits. The Maasai initiative homepage opens with the fitting Maasai proverb, \"Esuj erashe ng'ejuk emusana,\" which means: If an idea is good, it will be copied and followed.\"</p><p>According to the MIPI, the Maasai name, image and reputation is used around the world on products ranging from cars to shoes, and exercise equipment and estimates it could be worth billions of dollars over the long term.</p><p>Companies include Land Rover, which has a range of accessories under the name, speciality trainers Masai Barefoot Technology and Louis Vuitton, which has a Masai line, including beach towels, hats and scarves.</p><p>Light Years IP is involved in a small, but expanding area of development policy, known as \"intellectual property value capture.\" It is based on the premise that more should be done to address the fact that only a small fraction of the profits made on the international market go back to the original community that helped create them.</p><p><strong>Who owns culture? </strong></p><p>The work with the Maasai is not the first time that an indigenous peoples has acted to protect their economic rights. The Native American Navajo recently brought a case against the clothes company Urban Outfitters, for use of their name.</p><p>Only last week, the two sides announced they have failed to reach a settlement in the federal lawsuit. Urban Outfitters has argued that \"Navajo\" is a generic term for a style or design and has asserted counter claims. It is seeking a declaration of non-infringement and cancellation of the tribe's federal trademark registrations.</p><p>In similar fashion, it is also uncertain whether any IP protection is available to the Maasai tribe. One alternative route to formal IP protection might be for the Maasai to set up a voluntary code to govern the use of their cultural and intellectual property.</p><p>This may turn out to be as powerful a tool as securing IP protection, as few companies will want to risk negative publicity. After all, consumers are placing greater value on corporate social responsibility and ethics, and negative publicity could cause them to further question the true cultural, social and environmental value of what they purchase.</p><p><strong>What does this mean for ethical fashion?</strong></p><p>In terms of the realm of ethical fashion, the Maasai case is significant because many designers are now tapping into the group's renowned beading skills for high-end jewellery design and working with the community to produce pieces that showcase their traditional techniques.</p><p>Ethical fashion initiatives such as Fashion4Development, \"a global campaign that uses fashion-based initiatives to support the United Nations' wider issues in helping Africa,\" and the UN's International Trade Centre (ITC) Ethical Fashion Initiative, a project which connects the fashion business with African artisans, are underlining issues such as development, poverty reduction and environmental sustainability.</p><p>Top fashion brands such as British designer Vivienne Westwood, Stella McCartney, Australia's Sass and Bide and Italy's Ilaria Venturini Fendi are participating in these initiatives and working with indigenous communities to create fashion products featuring ethnic-influenced patterns, prints and designs inspired by the land and culture of the Kikuyu, Maasai, Samburu and other East African tribes.</p><p><strong>Does fashion need ethics?</strong></p><p>The fashion industry has often struggled to embrace an ethical business model. This case highlights the point that working with indigenous communities requires responsibility. As UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon put it in L'Uomo Vogue's recent issue, \"Rebranding Africa\": \"Africa does not need charity. Africa needs investment and partnership.\" </p><p>It's important to be aware of the risks when partnering with indigenous tribes and communities. As more companies look to the continent of Africa for inspiration, they must ensure that the these partnerships mutually benefit those communities.</p><p><em>Tania Phipps-Rufus is a lecturer of law at Hertfordshire University, an Ethical Fashion Forum consultant and professional fellow.

Yet over the past decade, the global spread of mobile phone networks and cheap handsets stands out as an under-utilised means to transform the collection of vital statistics and development meterics.</p><p>A mobile phone in the hands of a semi-literate midwife in rural Sierra Leone becomes a means to regularly communicate the number of births and infant deaths in her community. For the WHO's <a href=\"http://healthmarketinnovations.org/program/global-polio-eradication-initiative-gpei\" title=\"\">global polio eradication initiative</a>, mobile phones can replace paper forms to monitor coverage and manage stocks. In both cases a software programme, <a href=\"http://www.datadyne.org/magpi-mobile/\" title=\"\">Magpi</a>, makes this data collection possible even in the most remote and poorly resourced areas.</p><p>Previously named EpiSurveyor, DataDyne's Magpi uses what chief executive and co-founder Joel Selanikio describes as the Gmail model. \"Our target audience for Magpi is regular people. We are following the model of the web applications that we all know and love – Google Maps, Yahoo, Facebook, Flickr – that provide great free functionality.\"</p><p>The US-based company has a 10-person team, with programmers in Kenya. The software is offered on a 'freemium' basis: free for those who want a basic service, and fee-based for those who want more customisation. Designed to be as easy to use as Facebook, it creates surveys administered on mobile phones across the technological spectrum, from smartphones to a basic Nokia with a Symbian operating system to a $10 (£6) no-name handset that can only send data via text message.</p><p>Since 2005, 20,000 users (10,000 in the past year alone) in more than 170 countries have used Magpi for data collection, either for free, or for a fraction of what it would have cost for them to develop custom data collection software.</p><p>The International Rescue Committee (IRC) uses Magpi on between 40 and 60 projects at any given time. It started in 2011 in Kenema, Sierra Leone with a pilot of 60 of its 3,400 integrated community case management programme health workers. They used basic Nokia handsets to send weekly birth and infant mortality statistics from their practice. IRC paid DataDyne to make Magpi usable on the most basic of mobile phones, and in turn this function then became available to all Magpi users. The IRC project continues and has since been replicated in Congo, Liberia, and Somalia.</p><p>\"Real time reporting allows us to observe mortality trends and to respond immediately,\" says Paul Amendola, IRC's technical adviser for health information systems. \"We are able to get real time valid data in from rural far flung places with very little work to get it.\"</p><p>The pilot project gave valuable insights. Training times depends on the extent of existing technology: in Sierra Leone the community health workers, already familiar with mobile phones, were up and running in a few hours. In Congo, training had to start from the very basics.</p><p>The solar-powered chargers that IRC bought to keep the phones going turned out not to be robust enough, but the health workers then came up with their own solution: a few cents of extra phone time credit could be traded at the village store for charging time. Similarly, adding a small amount of extra credit for the health workers' own personal use ensured that the handsets stayed with them, and were looked after.</p><p>Literacy can be challenge, but it does not automatically equate to innumeracy. \"Some of the health workers couldn't write down the numbers we wanted them to send but they were perfectly able to text numbers into a phone keypad. To understand that relationship between literacy and numeracy you have to observe that for yourself,\" says Amendola.</p><p>The same is true for mobile coverage. While an area may be marked on a coverage map as unreliable, on the ground there was generally a solution. \"There was always someone who knew one place, such as a particular mango tree, where you could get just enough signal to send an SMS.\"</p><p>\"Mobile data collection is not a catch-all solution but it gives an incredible advantage to collect vital health data that is normally inaccessible,\" says Amendola. \"Mobile phone projects have a lot higher success when incorporated into existing health projects.\"</p><p>With the benefit of this software so seemingly apparent, why is it's use not more widespread in development or humanitarian work? Selanikio says the problem is not a technical one, but rather reflects a flaw in the NGO funding model: some organisations that work on a use-it-or-lose-it budget model are not at all interested in low-cost solutions. \"In international development almost every organisation is designed to promote solutions where they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop their own systems with almost no incentive to create something that lasts longer than a pilot project.\"</p><p>\"The first one to sign up for the paid version of Magpi was JSI, one of the biggest recipients of USAid contracts, then Abt Associates, and Management Sciences for Health – all of the not-for-profit organisations. Why? Because it saves them money,\" says Selanikio.</p><p>Still for many of the organisations using the software enables them to collect data that was simply impossible to gather in any meaningful way before. For organisations that are comfortable with experimenting with technology, services like Magpi allows them to focus resources on programmes themselves, offering a low-cost, accessible means to monitor projects, better understand the target population and measure the impact of what they do.</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

So why don't you?","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-30T15:31:08Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"news/oliver-burkeman-s-blog/2013/jul/30/eye-opening-social-media-web","fields":{"body":"<p>Snappy buzz-phrases identifying purported new social trends get invented, it seems, at the rate of about a hundred per week, and <a href=\"http://www.pragmaticmarketing.com/resources/crowd-branding\">most of them are worthless</a>. But a phrase coined by the media scholar Ethan Zuckerman jolted me out of my jargon-jadedness the other day. You see, I think I may be guilty of &quot;imaginary cosmopolitanism&quot;.</p> <p>Zuckerman invented the term to describe a certain kind of online behaviour. But the offline archetype of the imaginary cosmopolitan is the person who feels proud to live in a diverse city or neighbourhood – while being forced to concede that his or her actual social circle is suspiciously full of people of the same ethnicity, social class or age range. (Does this describe you? Me too.) On the web, Zuckerman argues in his recent book <a href=\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/rewire-digital-cosmopolitans-in-the-age-of-connection/\">Rewire: Digital Cosmopolitans In The Age Of Connection</a>, this phenomenon is amplified. We <em>feel</em> connected to distant corners of the globe – which makes it easier to ignore the fact that what we <em>actually</em> spend our time doing is chatting to the same kinds of people about the same kinds of stuff.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.pointofinquiry.org/ethan_zuckerman_digital_cosmopolitans_in_the_age_of_connection/\">this excellent Point of Inquiry podcast</a>, Zuckerman, who co-founded the blog network Global Voices, describes what happened when he measured his own online consumption, using the Mac app <a href=\"https://www.rescuetime.com/\">RescueTime</a>: &quot;I think of myself as a pretty global guy; I&apos;m on the boards of a bunch of international organisations… [but] I spend a lot of my time reading Reddit. And I spend a lot of my time reading about the <a href=\"http://www.packers.com/\">Green Bay Packers</a>.&quot;</p> <p>There&apos;s a longstanding debate about how far the internet serves to expose us to a diversity of viewpoints or functions, instead, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble\">as an echo chamber</a>. But Zuckerman&apos;s insight is that the two might be intimately connected. If you&apos;re comfortable spending your online life in an echo chamber, maybe it&apos;s because you believe you&apos;re sampling a much wider range of opinion and perspective. &quot;We need to ask whether we&apos;re reading <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/\">the Times of India</a>,&quot; Zuckerman writes, &quot;or imagining that we are simply because we could be.&quot;</p> <p>When Amazon recommends a book, or Facebook recommends a potential friend, you&apos;re benefiting from &quot;collaborative filtering&quot; – algorithms based on the assumption that you&apos;ll be interested in whatever those similar to you have already shown an interest in. Unfortunately, this only exacerbates <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/31/oliver-burkeman-column-homophily\">homophily</a>, our deep tendency to spend time with, and focus attention on, the people most like us. Using the web this way is a reliable route to getting the information you want. But Zuckerman argues that you may be missing the information you need – especially in an era when so many major challenges and opportunities are global in nature.</p> <p>He suggests a number of interim fixes for addressing your own imaginary cosmopolitanism. You could <a href=\"https://www.rescuetime.com/\">track your own web use using RescueTime</a>; you could examine possible gender bias in your Twitter habits with services like <a href=\"http://www.twee-q.com/\">Twee-q</a>; and you can follow the kinds of people Zuckerman calls &quot;xenophiles&quot; or &quot;bridge figures&quot; – culture-crossing homophily-destroyers such as the Kenya-born former US Marine <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whiteafrican\">Erik Hersman</a>, or the media and technology writers <a href=\"http://www.360east.com/\">Ahmad Humeid</a> or <a href=\"http://technosociology.org/\">Zeynep Tufekci</a>.</p> <p>But most of all, I like the sound of the hypothetical pro-serendipity recommendation engine Zuckerman proposes in the podcast:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can we find you someone who has partial overlap with you, but who is different in some very specific ways? If I were building an algorithm like this, I might say &apos;Hey, here&apos;s someone who tweeted five of the same URLs that you did this week, but this person&apos;s from Nigeria, and may have access to a very different social circle.</p> </blockquote> <p>Somebody build this, please!

Adding to these reservations is the issue of land rights: as the industry expands, how can we ensure these are preserved?</p><p>But, last month's <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/cfs/cfs-hlpe/en/\" title=\"\">report </a> (pdf) on biofuels and food security by the UN CFS high level panel of experts on food security and nutrition, suggests it might be time to reconsider its benefits: employment and income opportunities, increased agricultural productivity, reduction of CO2 emissions and increased energy independence. But in its conclusions, the report's authors concede that \"the potential impact of biofuel policies and projects can differ widely according to national and local conditions and to the choice of specific technologies and feedstocks.\"</p><p>So given all the conflicting evidence, is it time we ask not whether biofuels are fundamentally good or bad but how, in policy and practice, their cultivation can be green, equitable and sustainable? On what scale should biofuels be produced? Is effective technology or the evidence of social and economic impact what's missing? And as policymakers in the developed world consider fuel options for a sustainable future, how do we not lose sight of farmers and consumers in low and middle-income countries?</p><p>Join our expert panel Thursday 1 August, at 1pm BST, to debate the future of biofuels in development.</p><p><em>The live chat is not video or audio-enabled but will take place in the comments section (below).

Nowhere does this represent itself more acutely than in international development in the way donors, governments, and citizens work with one another – or often don't.</p><p>In international development, we need collaboration, not just co-operation, to change the world. Now, a consortium of organisations has come together to imagine a scenario where aid is not just a one-way street, but rather a dynamic feedback loop where citizens can drive how resources are allocated and services provided in their communities.</p><p>The vision is a metaphorical \"yelp for development\". What if we could use open data to allow people to choose and rate what they see and <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/blog/make-consumer-reports-aid\" title=\"\">experience in their communities</a> and allow an average citizen to express his or her views? What if we had a system that could answer questions such as: do teachers show up to teach? How long is the wait time at the health clinic and its level of quality? How do we use transparency, people, and technology to create real conversations around service delivery and accountability?</p><p>This concept of \"feedback loops\" is a hot topic, although not particularly well-defined. If there is a reason for the use of the term in the context of citizen engagement, no serious effort has been made to explain what that is. That said, the concept is called by many different names (eg citizen engagement, feedback loops, citizen voice, etc), and as <a href=\"http://democracyspot.net/2013/06/17/open-government-feedback-loops-and-semantic-extravaganza/\" title=\"\">Tiago Peixoto explains</a>, there are benefits and drawbacks to these diverse labels. Each label connotes past initiatives that have achieved varying degrees of success and failure. As we explore the web of definitions, perspectives, interventions, and incentives, one thing becomes very clear: it all comes down to conversations, relationships, and trust to alter the power balance.</p><p>Rakesh Rajani of Twaweza, a Kenya-based nongovernmental organisation, illustrates its recent experience. A large district hospital in Isiolo seemed to have impressive services in place. It had information billboards, telephone numbers to handle complaints, and other ways for citizens to provide feedback.</p><p>But citizens simply weren't using them. When asked why, the answer was clear. According to Rajani: \"People simply did not believe that anybody would take it seriously, or that it would make any difference. Where people have had 10, 15, 20 years of unresponsive states and complaints mechanisms that do nothing, simply introducing technology or new client service charters cannot automatically restore confidence.\"</p><p>The Twaweza team then called one of the telephone numbers to register a complaint, and immediately received professional, responsive service.</p><p>It's only an anecdote, but it shows that even when a feedback mechanism is in place, one may need to restore trust and build local credibility first. With lack of confidence and trust, all the technology and education in the world won't create an environment that fosters citizens to participate in their own development. Often, investment in existing trust based relationships are the missing ingredient.</p><p>In an effort to address this complex set of issues: a like-minded group of organisations have joined forces to create <a href=\"http://www.feedbacklabs.org\" title=\"\">Feedback Labs</a>. It involves <a href=\"http://www.ashoka.org\" title=\"\">Ashoka</a>, <a href=\"http://www.developmentgatewya.org\" title=\"\">Development Gateway</a>, <a href=\"http://www.frontlinemsms.org\" title=\"\">FrontlineSMS</a>, <a href=\"http://www.globalgiving.org\" title=\"\">GlobalGiving</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.groundtruth.in\" title=\"\">GroundTruth Initiative</a>, <a href=\"http://www.keystoneaccountability.org\" title=\"\">Keystone Accountability</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twaweza.org/\" title=\"\">Twaweza</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a>.</p><p>Our organisations share the belief that everyday citizens should have the right to real-time information about the programmes and initiatives that affect their lives and the ability to give feedback on what's working, what's not, what they need, and what they don't. Our goal is to make feedback loops the new norm in aid, development, and philanthropy, and we envision a world where citizens are empowered with creative, field-tested ways to productively interact with aid agencies, foundations, and governments.</p><p>We are at a critical point in history where prioritising citizen feedback has the potential to unleash massive changes in the way development is pursued. This field – which we term \"feedback loops\" for lack of a better name – is still uncharted and unbounded. While its potential is enormous, the concept lacks consistent vocabulary, principles, accepted best practices, and reliable measurements. We aim to help provide the structure and design principles that will maximise the effects of global citizen engagement efforts.</p><p>Together, we have identified a few key steps ahead. First, there is a pressing need to frame the reason why feedback loops are so important, using research and open conversation to clarify a number of key theoretical and empirical issues in the field. We need to experiment to more systematically uncover what works and what doesn't, bringing together our learning in an open and honest way. To the extent that we uncover truly transformative insights, or – better yet – models that are replicable and scalable, we then plan to mainstream these models with the government, agencies, and organisational partners poised to make citizen feedback a new norm.</p><p>While we are optimistic that prioritising citizen feedback has the potential to change how development is done, the road ahead is still uncharted and daunting. The concept lacks consistent vocabulary, principles, accepted best practices, and reliable measurements. In addition, our success hinges on our ability to engage governments, NGOs, and citizens alike to talk about the way aid is designed, delivered, and evaluated. We also understand the solution to be greater than the sum of our contributions, and will require an understanding of complex systems, politics, and human behaviour.</p><p>Ultimately, our greatest challenge will be to build trust – to demonstrate to citizens that their feedback had a visible and direct effect on decision-making and service delivery. Only through true partnership with citizens can we succeed at inspiring the institutional changes needed to make feedback loops the new gold standard.</p><p><em>Stephen Davenport is the director of innovation at the </em><a href=\"http://www.developmentgateway.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Development Gateway</em></a><em> and co-executive director of </em><a href=\"http://www.aiddata.org/\" title=\"\"><em>AidData</em></a><em> .

Martin Wheeler stands on a rocky bluff overlooking an expanse of semi-arid land framed by the mountain ranges of the Northern Frontier District, the \"wild-west\" for anyone who knows Kenya well. Blood Mountain with its right-angled peak rises out of the scrub a few miles away.</p><p>Tiny birds with tremendous songs are raising a ruckus, but otherwise all is quiet. There is no turf war or skirmishes over cattle-rustling today, just a complex billion-dollar global battle over an enduring prehistoric asset: the elephant.</p><p>\"I'll just see if there are any elephants on my landing,\" Wheeler says, peering down at the dry riverbed below. His motorised backpack and paraglider allow him to go anywhere. Wearing a harness and a helmet, he looks nervous. The wind has dropped. A GPS handset and altimeter are strapped to his thigh. Standing 50 metres from the edge, with what is essentially a lawn-mower engine and a large fan on his back, a giant kite stretched out behind, he takes a last look at a crumpled windsock, inhales deeply, and runs off the cliff.</p><p>Wheeler and a security team look after the Lekerruki group ranch owned by the Mukogodo-Maasai people, 24,280 hectares (60,000 acres) of wilderness in north-eastern Kenya.</p><p>Early in the morning one of the team, Laban, found human tracks while crossing a dry riverbed. The former elephant hunter is now a well-trained wildlife ranger, armed with a semi-automatic rifle and the jurisdiction to use it. He reported the details of the tracks to security command, identifying even the brand of shoe.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-413140046'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/7/18/1374164590280/Elephant-carcass-010.jpg' alt='Elephant carcass' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The carcass of an elephant left by poachers in northern Kenya. Photograph: Kristian Schmidt/WildAid</figcaption></figure><p>Rangers at a distant outpost also reported hearing gunshots during the night. A aeroplane from a nearby conservancy has done a flyby, and a car has been deployed, but on this sand, where roads are virtually nonexistent, it is difficult to cover the ground. Wheeler wants to have a look for himself. \"We are doing all we can with every tool we have available; on foot, by vehicle, by plane and now by para-motor,\" he says.</p><p>A quietly spoken young Kenyan, Wheeler's face becomes animated when he talks about birds– he has a sanctuary for rehabilitating birds of prey – and his jaw becomes set with uncharacteristic anger when the topic of poaching comes up, as it inevitably does. Africa's wild elephants are being killed at their fastest rate since 1979-89, the bloody decade in which their number more than halved from 1.4m to 600,000. Wheeler, like many conservationists, is on the frontline.</p><p>Elephants are the most prevalent big animal species on the Lekkuruki group ranch, where he and his girlfriend, Antonia Hall, run a lodge. \"Paramotoring air patrol enables a more constant presence. You can cover large areas without disturbing wildlife or livestock. Its unobtrusive, and slow moving, so you gain unobstructed views,\" he says.</p><p>Aerial surveillance using drones has proven a successful conservation tool in Madagascar and elsewhere, and private conservation firm, Ol Pejeta Conservancy, hopes to trial the technology in Kenya within the next two months.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-413140047'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/7/18/1374164998853/Kenya-burns-4.6-tonnes-of-010.jpg' alt='Kenya burns 4.6 tonnes of contraband ivory' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Kenya's then president, Mwai Kibaki, far right, sets alight confiscated elephant tusks at Tsavo West national park.

Speaking earlier this year at the British high commission in Nairobi, the UK minister for natural resources, Richard Benyon, said organised gangs and militias now used helicopters and gun silencers to poach. \"State of the art technology is being used to prosecute this dreadful trade,\" said Benyon.</p><p>Also speaking, Christian Turner, the high commissioner, added: \"Illegal wildlife trade is the 5th largest illicit transnational activity and the potential for profits of poaching to feed back into terrorist activity is real.\"</p><p>Earlier in July, the US pledged $10m to combat the trade during Barack Obama's visit to Tanzania. On Tuesday, the former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton added her name to the fight.</p><p>\"All figures suggest that the [elephant] population has now dropped below 500,000 and may be 450,000 or lower,\" says Charlie Mayhew, chief executive of the charity Tusk Trust. Experts estimate Africa will lose another 30,000 this year.</p><p>Arappa, a Mukogodo-Maasai security scout at the Lekerruki group ranch, says he did not know what to think when he saw Wheeler's first \"bird-man\" voyage last year. \"Martin helps us to keep our land free of poaching in every way possible. We never though it could be done like this. When we first saw the machine, we laughed, but now we see it benefits the conservancy and the community,\" he says.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/7/18/1374163729575/Kenyan-bird-man-Martin-Wh-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/22/kenya-conservation-birdman-elephant-poach","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jul/22/kenya-conservation-birdman-elephant-poach","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"How can video game developers in the global south go viral? | Dan Griliopoulos","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-15T15:29:39Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jul/15/video-game-developers-global-south","fields":{"body":"<p>The video games industry is huge – <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/01/us-videogameshow-e3-show-factbox-idUSBRE8501IN20120601\" title=\"\">worth $78bn (£51.6bn) in 2012</a> – the size of the movie and music industries combined. Yet almost all games are produced in the developed world. The limitations on producing games in the global south are manifold – technological, educational and financial. So how can game creators in these areas grow?</p><p>Even in relatively wealthy South Africa games consoles are years behind – as Howard Lonstein of <a href=\"http://www.sterkinekor.com/\" title=\"\">Ster Kinekor</a>, the country's biggest entertainment distributor, points out, the 13-year-old PlayStation 2 was discounted only a few months ago.</p><p>Support from games publishers outside their core territories is minimal – the world's biggest online games distribution service, <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/\" title=\"\">Steam</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mybroadband.co.za/news/gaming/19183-could-using-steam-in-south-africa-be-illegal.html\" title=\"\">may well be illegal in South Africa</a> but it is difficult to use because of local bandwidth limits.

On top of that, the hurdles to creating games on the current platforms are high: access to the specialised hardware and licences provided by the console manufacturers is expensive and not given easily.</p><p>The most common platform for gaming in Africa and Asia is the mobile phone. In Africa, of the <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTINFORMATIONANDCOMMUNICATIONANDTECHNOLOGIES/Resources/282822-1346223280837/MainReport.pdf\" title=\"\">650m mobile phones</a> (pdf) Nokia Series 40 and BlackBerry 7 are still the dominant platforms, says Adam Oxford of <a href=\"http://www.htxt.co.za/\" title=\"\">htxt.co.za</a>. \"<a href=\"http://site.mxit.com/\" title=\"\">Mxit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.binu.com/\" title=\"\">BiNu</a> are really big social networks geared up for feature phones, with massive followings in SA [South Africa] and Nigeria\" he adds. \"There are loads of games on both platforms.\"</p><p>India has about 860m mobile phones, of which 6% are smartphones. This restricts creators to the simpler feature phones and the more-flexible Android and Java programming language – which have to compete for attention with faster and more experienced western game creators.</p><p>Not that there are many local developers in the global south. In Africa, there are just a handful, scattered through countries such as Nigeria, Uganda, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. Nana Kwabena Owusu of Ghana's <a href=\"http://www.letigames.com/letiarts/\" title=\"\">Leti Games</a> thinks this shortage of talent is an education problem. \"There are good creators, but retraining them to think in terms of game development, merging technical and creative thinking, is tough.\" This is not a problem restricted to Africa – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jan/10/a-new-year-challenge-on-programming-for-politicians-schools-and-universities\" title=\"\">the education system in the UK has only just been restructured to encourage good programmers</a> and game design is mostly learned through experience in studios.</p><p>Leti makes games for international and local markets, but most creators in Africa and Asia focus on the overseas market.

Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>In India, there are more than 90 commercial studios, some of which do international contract development, as well as innumerable independent studios – but there are other problems. An anonymous producer from a large game publisher told the Guardian: \"We have some extremely talented creators, like <a href=\"http://www.yellowmonkeystudios.com/\" title=\"\">Yellow Monkey</a>, <a href=\"http://supersikegames.com/\" title=\"\">SuperSike</a> and <a href=\"http://rolocule.com/\" title=\"\">Rolecule</a>, who are trying to push the envelope of what can be done creatively on mobile platforms. On the other hand we have studios set up to cash in on naive venture capitalists … most of the gaming data reports, barring Sony's, are venture capitalist bait. It's the wild west of game development.\"</p><p>Sameer Desai of <a href=\"http://www.mcvindia.com/\" title=\"\">MCV India</a>, a games industry business site, is just as scathing about the quality of products: \"That's mostly down to the lack of quality game creator education in India. The international creators that have set up shop in India have done so with outsourcing as their primary objective, so there's very little creative freedom there. The indies are pretty much learning as they go.</p><p>\"The game creators that do make good money are those that develop for feature phones (<a href=\"http://www.indiagames.com/\" title=\"\">Indiagames</a>, <a href=\"http://www.zapak.com/\" title=\"\">Zapak</a>), but the quality of games here is even poorer since the target audience is people in smaller towns who don't know much about games at all. There are also a lot of questions being asked about how these devs operate. They often push games to consumers through mobile service operators without explicit consent from the user.\"</p><p>Of course, it's not just domestic developers who create games targeted at Africa and India. But western creators who target the developing world over a global market tend to have a developmental or educational agenda. <a href=\"http://www.gamesforchange.org/\" title=\"\">Games for Change (GFC)</a> is a New York-based organisation promoting games that drum up support among westerners or seek to educate people in poorer countries. Games they have backed include <a href=\"http://www.halftheskymovement.org/pages/mobile-games\" title=\"\">Half the Sky's Nine Minutes</a>, which is aimed at couples in Kenya and India, simulates the nine-month pregnancy cycle and offers advice for a successful delivery.</p><p>As Asi Burak, co-founder of GFC, says, getting development games into the right hands is a challenge: \"Limited access to technology is prevalent, especially in non-urban and remote areas, where your solutions are needed the most. Or consider language: limited to no reading skills and numerous dialects across a single region or country.\"</p><p>And GFC's difficulties do not stop there. \"If you are headquartered in the west, you need to solve communication challenges, bridge cultural sensitivities and differences, and build marketing and distribution capacity in an uncharted market. In most cases, you could only do that with strong partners on the ground that are deeply involved in the development, production and outreach – from local NGOs to local creators to game publishers and mobile operators.\"</p><p>Despite this, GFC provides <a href=\"http://www.gamesforchange.org/2013/03/9-minutes-mobile-game-evaluation-demonstrates-positive-change-for-pregnant-women/\" title=\"\">evidence that its games are working</a> – people do play development games.

This is exacerbated by outmoded laws and the lack of capacity to enforce those laws, high dependency on primary commodities, made worse by declining (or volatile) commodity prices and unfair trade practices, as well as very poor financial inclusion for the millions of people without access to banking services.</p><p>African financial systems are among the smallest in the world, as measured by private credit to GDP and domestic revenues  that are usually not adequate to meet the development requirements of a continent that is playing catch-up in a highly competitive global village. Yet, as Africa keeps growing it is important that governments mobilise and allocate more resources towards development.</p><p>Financial and technological innovation is helping Africa expand the coverage of financial services. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/aug/14/mobile-banking-africa-mpesa\" title=\"\">Mobile banking</a> is a good example of how African financial systems are providing access to basic payment services through mobile phones, even without a bank account.</p><p>Another example of financial innovation is tailor-making the credit assessment process to the circumstances of African entrepreneurs through the use of psychometric assessments as a low-cost, automated screening tool to identify high-potential entrepreneurs. The <a href=\"http://www.standardbank.com/\" title=\"\">Standard Bank Group,</a> for instance, has been very successful with their product, <a href=\"http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/how-standard-bank-is-tapping-africa%E2%80%99s-sme-market/15493/\" title=\"\">SME quick loans</a> which makes the use of <a href=\"http://sustainability.standardbank.com/socioeconomic-development-overview/enterprise-development/supporting-smes-in-africa/\" title=\"\">psychometric testing as opposed to financial analysis</a>. With agriculture being a significant subsistence and commercial activity on the continent, farmers' fortunes are being supported by the creation of suitable agricultural insurance products.</p><p>Africa is making efforts to reach out to previously unbanked parts of the population. Successes have been realised through the cell phone-based <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\" title=\"\">M-Pesa</a> in Kenya. <a href=\"https://www.econet.co.zw/ecocash/\" title=\"\">Ecocash</a> in Zimbabwe and the basic transaction accounts, such as <a href=\"https://www.fnb.co.za/savings-accounts/mzansi-account.html\" title=\"\">Mzansi accounts</a> in South Africa.</p><p>With improvements in the business environment, the private sector is growing in confidence to do business in Africa, representing an important opportunity for private sector driven development. Africa has immense opportunities to ride on successful implementation of public-private partnerships in the areas of infrastructure development and social services provision. This option has been tried and tested in  parts of the continent, with success stories in the water supply systems in west Africa and transportation projects in southern Africa.</p><p>Africa still needs to deepen the financial systems through the development and expansion of local and regional pension funds and life insurance markets; as well as local and regional bond trading markets. This will enable mobilisation of medium to long-term finance, which is seriously scarce.</p><h2><strong>Bringing in the informal sector into the development process</strong><br /></h2><p>There is an argument that since developed economies are not driven by informal sector activities, it is flawed to attempt to drive economic progress through the informal sector elsewhere. This argument does not recognise that in some parts of Africa this sector contributes more than 60% of employment and income. As such, there is no better development process that includes the majority of economic players.</p><p>Financial institutions often find the risk of doing business in the informal sector higher than with formal businesses. The problem is exacerbated by the lack of information for traditional credit rating tools. Innovations using alternative assessment tools such as psychometric evaluation of borrowers represent workable options to promote access to financial resources in this sector. Training programmes tailor-made for the requirements of the informal sector entrepreneurs are not readily available and affordable. This would require those who design educations systems to be responsive to this growing need.</p><p>Small traders, hawkers and backyard industries are often not properly regulated, leading to harassment, frequent arrest of traders, confiscation of their goods and punitive fines. In most cases these traders need assistance. For example, by designating specific zones for their activities. There are potential fiscal revenue benefits to be achieved by legalising and properly catering for the development needs of the informal sector.</p><p>In conclusion, the challenge of developing the financial sector in most underdeveloped countries can be summarised using one word: costs. This refers to costs of putting up infrastructure to service the majority of people previously excluded from the formal financial sector, such as buildings, telecommunications systems, or the costs related to educating the masses about formal banking structures.</p><p>This is a cost banks should not shy away from as in the long run the survival of the banks specifically, as well as the development of Africa in general, will depend on the successful implementation of financial inclusion policies and programmes.</p><p><em>Pindie Nyandoro is the executive director of </em><a href=\"http://www.standardbank.com.na/portal/site/namibia/menuitem.a1ee6dc6c7fccad41413ac533d9006a0/?vgnextoid=4a0c5ac19c948210VgnVCM100000d309600aRCRD\" title=\"\"><em>Standard Bank of Namibia Limited</em></a><em>.

My job in San Francisco means that I often visit many of the major tech hubs around the world, but still, I was not prepared for the amount of inspiration I got from my trip to Africa.</p><p>To put it mildly, the entrepreneurial flair in the region is electric. Opportunity is as fertile as the red soil of the land underfoot, waiting to be harvested. So what can western entrepreneurs learn from this rapidly emerging region?</p><h2>Focus on growth</h2><p>It is clear that mobile is leading the way across Africa, and like many emerging countries, they skipped right past the cable infrastructure that tethers much of western country communication to expensive and aging technology.</p><p>One technology hub I visited, the <a href=\"http://mlab.co.ke/pages/home.php\" title=\"\">m:lab</a>, was full of state-of-the-art mobile devices and teeming with eager mobile app developers. However, these entrepreneurs weren't just being taught how to build more apps, they were being taught how to build growth businesses. Before you can graduate from the m:lab, students must register a business, bring their product to market and show at least six months of growth.</p><p>This focus on rapid growth was inspiring. Investors are harder to come by in this region, so entrepreneurs are forced to look at how every decision, whether it is product or personnel-related, affects the business in its earliest stages.</p><h2>West-sourcing v local-sourcing</h2><p>Nairobi benefits the most from western investment. It is truly a city on the verge of greatness, but this attention from foreign companies comes at a price. Many of the entrepreneurs I met in Nairobi were westerners who saw an opportunity and quickly set up shop. As these companies grew, they hired local staff, which is fantastic for the local economy, but I couldn't help but feel that this emphasis on west-sourcing is only good in the short term. For a region heavily influenced by colonial rule, independence and national identity are powerful motivators.</p><p>Kampala, the capital of Uganda, is a great example of where I believe local-sourcing will serve the country and economy well in the long term. Kampala often misses out on foreign investment to Nairobi. The result is a heavy investment in local skills training and a very tight entrepreneur community, where everyone knows everyone and is willing to help out. They are the underdogs. They have everything to lose.</p><p>The importance of local-sourcing anywhere in the world cannot be underestimated. There will always be magnets of tech investment that draw foreign attention, but every one of these tech hubs started with friends helping friends, and locals helping locals – just look at the lineage of almost every software or hardware company in Silicon Valley.</p><h2>It begins with utilities</h2><p>Entrepreneurs that I met with during my time in East Africa were heavily focused on building basic utility services: communication, money transfer, social good projects and healthcare, for example. By developing utility services, even the most remote communities benefit from the influx of technology and investment – foreign or local.</p><p>With such a large rural population in East Africa, these utility services can quickly become the new normal. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11793290\" title=\"\">m-Pesa</a> is probably the most notable example. The microfinance platform now manages the transfer of roughly 31% of the Kenyan GDP through mobile phones – never touching a bank!</p><p>Western entrepreneurs can learn a lot from the East African utility model. Studying the economy of a desired market is a sensible approach, deciding whether basic services are required first, or if the community is ready for convenience services such as social networking, lifestyle (news, travel, music, shopping) or business apps (track a package, check invoices etc). Of course, even within established countries, disruptive ideas that reimagine basic services can be the next killer technology – just ask <a href=\"https://squareup.com/\" title=\"\">Square</a> or Twitter.</p><h2>Now it's your turn</h2><p>If my time in East Africa taught me anything, it is the realisation that wherever there is opportunity, there are creative individuals we collectively refer to as entrepreneurs who thrive on building something out of nothing. Whether growing a hot startup in downtown San Francisco, studying computer science in Hyderabad, or selling fresh produce at a local farmer's market, the learnings from my time in East Africa always apply: focus on a business model designed for growth, invest locally, and if utility services either don't exist or are ready for disruption, (re)invent them.</p><p><em>Quinton Wall is director of technical platform marketing at </em><a href=\"http://www.salesforce.com/uk/?ir=1\" title=\"\"><em>salesforce.com</em></a></p><p><strong>Get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox by </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media\" title=\"\"><strong>signing up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong> – this content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/9/1373359919075/Traffic-on-an-East-Africa-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/jul/09/digital-entrepreneurs-east-african-startups","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/jul/09/digital-entrepreneurs-east-african-startups","sectionName":"Media Network"},{"webTitle":"Mental health needs realistic treatment – or we face decades of wasted time","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-08T11:39:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/jul/08/mental-health-treatment-developing-countries","fields":{"body":"<p>The United Nations regularly declares that \"<a href=\"http://www.un.org/sg/statements/?nid=5592\" title=\"\">there is no health without mental health</a>.\" It's a statement that holds much truth, yet little meaning in relation to mental health's standing in the development sector and governmental policies.</p><p>About <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dfid-research-considering-mental-health-in-africa\" title=\"\">13% of all global illnesses</a> are said to be related to mental health, and in low and middle-income countries it's reported that up to four in five people fail to receive proper treatment or care. This, combined with the fact that a majority of the developing countries dedicate less than 2% of their <a href=\"http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241548069_eng.pdf\" title=\"\">health budget to mental health care</a> (pdf), is a reflection of how inadequate awareness of the issue is.</p><p>NGOs can play a decisive role in ensuring that those with mental health problems aren't neglected; they can help rebuild community resilience, develop relationships between patients and carers, or those administering treatment, and create greater awareness of mental health issues. Understanding mental health as a disability is beneficial. Yet, even organisations who work with the world's 1 billion disabled population can often fail to deal with disability at a macro-level – for example, lack of awareness of the issue in their literature – so mental health as part of field work, at a micro-level, is vulnerable to being mismanaged too. This mismanagement is partly the result of a lack of comprehensive data and the way data collation is implemented.</p><p>Trying to reach some of the most vulnerable people in society, many of whom are unwilling to talk sue to the stigma of their conditions, is tricky. The situation can be made worse if a patient has acquired sensory problems, such as difficulty speaking. Finding common ground and ways to develop universal forms of communication can provide a strong basis to carry out research, collate data and to even help deliver better treatment to patients. Mobile and SMS technology, for instance, has become a vital tool in reaching out to people in low resource environments and who otherwise might be inaccessible.</p><p>\"In Kenya, for example, there is one psychiatrist for every 500,000 people and one psychologist for every 1 million people. However, we have the mobile phone, whose penetration in Kenya is 74% … smartphone usage is steadily growing too,\" says Gladys Mwiti, founder of the <a href=\"http://counselingcenter.oasisafrica.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Oasis Africa</a> Centre for transformational psychology &amp; trauma expertise.</p><p>The centre is currently collaborating with the <a href=\"http://www.womensresearch.ca/\" title=\"\">Women's College Research Institute</a>, at the University of Toronto, on a mobile app that will provide information for adult survivors of child abuse and neglect. The app will focus on trauma and its impact, personal trauma management, links to professional care and coping with and knowledge of on-going trauma management and resiliency building.</p><p>The project has recently applied for a grant from the Canadian government, though generally, funding hasn't been easy to come by – a situation that isn't uncommon for any development project looking for financial backing. Mwiti does forecast a change in attitude though. \"Indeed, development agencies are beginning to believe that without mental health, years of grant activities in Africa will only produce wasted decades unless holistic solutions are realised,\" she says.</p><p>How then can western-based NGOs implement holistic solutions, and how practical would they be? Failure to do this efficiently could lead to NGO employees entering a foreign country without a suitable grasp of the language or cultural differences, and ending up introducing westernised treatments that don't compute and misunderstand local attitudes, such as a trauma patient being possessed by a devil. Not understanding the local context is also true of southern NGOs who may have an \"urban bias\" and to whom the cultural practices in rural areas a completely foreign.</p><p>\"Language is definitely a barrier. Terms which seem simple to us, such as 'depression' or 'trauma', may not translate easily,\" says Natalie Mehrgott, a psychotherapist who has worked in Kampala and Lusaka and has first-hand experience of dealing with trauma patients and refugees.</p><p>\"Experimenting with words that [patients] may better relate to could help overcome these barriers; like substituting 'depression' for 'sadness'. I also find focusing on body language can ease the process of dealing with patients who have difficulty communicating – especially hand gestures. When talking directly about 'depression' or 'trauma' I may clench my fist against my chest and then rub my eye with the other hand as if I were wiping away a tear.\"</p><p>Treatment can be a bit of a misnomer, particularly if it's poorly thought out and fails to communicate sympathetically with the patient. Mehrgott indicates that it could do more damage than good and can reinforce the problems that it's trying to address. Adopting simpler language and hand gestures can be ways to actively work with the wider community too. Improving how locals perceive mental health is imperative to how patients may see themselves and understand their condition. At the same time, treatment can also become a bit of a distraction if NGOs fail to realise that mental health problems aren't just symptomatic of conflict or post-traumatic stress disorder. Even though mental health is closely linked to events such as war, it shouldn't be assumed that they have caused the health problem. Rather the situation patients find themselves in makes them more pronounced.</p><p>Realising the complexities of mental health is critical to understanding how it coalesces with poverty, education, employment, general health and conflict itself. By doing this and acknowledging cultural sensitivities and potential language barriers, NGOs can work towards realistic holistic solutions that can provide relief to mental health patients.</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

First up is a beat based on a sample from an old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benga_music\" title=\"\">Benga</a> tune – the guitar music that dominated Kenyan nightlife in previous decades. Bill \"Blinky\" Sellanga, from local group <a href=\"http://www.just-a-band.com/\" title=\"\">Just a Band</a>, is impressed. \"I pay a lot of attention to this music,\" he says, \"but some of the sounds were completely new even to me.\"</p><p>Next up is an old-school, hip-hop beat with a vocal from Bill himself. Batida plans to make this eventually sound like an early 80s hip-hop cut from Nairobi – even if there wasn't actually a hip-hop scene here then. \"It's just something I'd like to imagine,\" he says.</p><p>The two have been brought together – along with the Lisbon brothers duo Octa Push and local teen heart-throbs Camp Mulla – by the Nairobi branch of the <a href=\"http://www.goethe.de/ins/ke/nai/uun/mit/kul/enindex.htm\" title=\"\">Goethe-Institut</a>, the German cultural centre. It is part of an impressively resourced project called Ten Cities that is criss-crossing Africa and Europe seeking answers to these questions: \"What is the social meaning of music in Johannesburg and Kiev? How is electric music produced and distributed in Luanda and in Lisbon? What is the meaning of the public sphere in Cairo and in Naples? What does identity entail in Lagos and Berlin? What is subculture in Bristol and in Nairobi? And, most importantly, what if these 10 scenes were to respond directly to each other?\"</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJiypfOcRTs\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJiypfOcRTs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>Along with the music-making going on in Kileleshwa, 21 authors and academics have convened in a windowless room at the Institut. The project is the baby of the organisation's genial director, Johannes Hossfeld, who had nothing to do in the evenings when he arrived in the city six years ago. \"So I went clubbing – and I found myself thinking, 'What is going on here? It is so&nbsp;utterly different from in Germany!' The project is not about forcing German culture on people – it's about showing that we're able to put people together and make cultural connections.\"</p><p>The first connections had actually been made the night before, at an informal get-together, where members of the group encourage precisely the sort of lazy thinking about stereotypes that they will spend the next two days deconstructing. The lugubrious Ukrainian, for instance, has come from Kiev with his own bottle of vodka in case the local Tusker beer isn't sufficiently potent.</p><p>The Lagos contingent soon start dominating the discourse with a ribald argument about Fuji music, a popular Nigerian genre that has its origins in the music that was used to wake Muslims before dawn during Ramadan. \"A Fuji show is crazy,\" they say. \"It is crazy! Crazy!\" \"The ladies will come with enormous bum bums – and they will be shaking only one buttcheek.\" \"It is crazy! And the men – the men are wearing only Italian leather shoes!\"</p><p>Back in the musicians' house, which is off limits to the academics, Batida is waxing eloquently about how things look from the front line. \"I always bring on the FruityLoops conversation,\" he says when I ask him how technology is revolutionising music-making around the world. \"It's so much easier to make music with software like that, and it can run on cheap PCs which are suddenly everywhere. It means power has been taken out of the studios.\" Coupled with transformations in distribution, thanks to the likes of Facebook and Soundcloud, \"things are very different from even five years ago. It's all more anarchic.\"</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPe8_SLncik\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HPe8_SLncik?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>Born in Luanda in Angola, Batida released his self-titled debut album last year, sampling old Angolan records that he twisted into new patterns. He is now researching Benga music in order to work on some new music with Just a Band. \"The danger with this new technology,\" he cautions, \"is that everything can end up sounding similar – wherever you go, it all tastes the same.\"</p><p>Sounding as if he might endorse this concern, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2013/05/last-train-zona-verde-paul-theroux-how-not-write-about-africa\" title=\"\">the jaundiced Paul Theroux bemoans the \"rappers and cellphoners\" taking over the continent</a> in his new book about Africa, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/jun/01/train-zone-verde-theroux-review\" title=\"\">The Last Train to Zona Verde</a>. But then perhaps Theroux has never heard Just a Band, a deliciously leftfield R&amp;B act. \"The sound of our first record was so unfamiliar they wouldn't play the video on Channel O,\" says Bill Sellanga, Channel O being one of the cable TV stations now spreading pop culture to Africa's burgeoning middle classes. \"Then when they did, they said by mistake that we were from Nigeria, because no one could imagine a Kenyan band like this.\"</p><p>Downstairs, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roa8DhZgPNI\" title=\"\">Octa Push</a> are working on a track with Karun, the teenage singer from Camp Mulla, who's been making notes on her iPad. \"We need to change it,\" says one of the Portuguese brothers. \"It sounds too American or European – it's not what we're doing here.\" The track sees Karun singing the refrain: \"Which part of the jungle are you from?\" Would she sound better in Swahili?</p><p>Looking on are two more musicians: Austrian composer <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Lukas Ligeti</a> (son of the composer Gyorgy) and local rapper <a href=\"http://octopizzo.com/home/about-octopizzo/\" title=\"\">Octopizzo</a>, his name coincidentally close to that of the Portuguese producers. The latter is also an actor on an MTV series in Kenya. \"Being a rapper means I can establish myself as a brand,\" he tells me.</p><p>Back at the Institut, the silver-ponytailed <a href=\"http://www.dur.ac.uk/ias/fellows/0910fellows/chambers/\" title=\"\">Iain Chambers</a>, professor of cultural and postcolonial studies at the Oriental University in Naples and distinguished author of 1985's Urban Rhythms: Pop Music and Popular Culture, is asking \"What do we mean when we talk about a club? What is a club in Luanda? What is a club in Berlin? What do we actually mean when we talk about dance music?\"</p><p>The chirpy Hossfeld whispers how important it is to establish a framework for the fuller discourse that will follow, just as Mtudi, one of the Nigerian representatives, chips in with a lengthy explanation of what constitutes a party in Lagos: \"Funerals … funerals – you go to get drunk or to get high!\" This leads to Bart, the Ukrainian, asking: \"What went wrong? In Europe, when someone dies, everyone just cries for a week.\" This makes Angela from Angola wonder if it's a Christian problem, and this in turn provokes one of the Neapolitans to defend the tradition of the tarantella, before one of the Bristol crew trumpets: \"At wakes in our country, everyone just gets really, really pissed.\"</p><p>Lessons learned, the session continues, participants taking it in turn to sketch the history of nightlife in their respective cities, and presenting notes on the paper they will ultimately write for the wider research project. And as much as the shadow of Posy Simmonds' beloved sociology lecturer George Webber looms when Mtudi proposes discussing in his paper \"The relationship between fractals (chaos theory) and Fuji music\", even the non-academic eavesdropper can appreciate, for instance, the discussion of the burgeoning Sha'by underground scene in Cairo led by the Egyptian representative, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MahaElNabawi\" title=\"\">Maha El Nabawi</a>.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS3jQJFv1-A\">  <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WS3jQJFv1-A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>  </iframe></figure><p>The academics also succeed in getting their hands dirty on the local nightlife scene when, at the end of the second day, the Ten Cities musicians stage a gig in a warehouse space (actually an empty car garage), a novel concept in Nairobi. To the relief of the Goethe organisers, it is rammed, with a mixture of NGO workers and expats and stylish locals, everyone brought together by a thunderous performance from Batida.</p><p>The next day, the academics head off to carry on their discussions, and a few weeks later some of those involved leave for Cairo for a further phase. In Kenya, it was a case of pairing acts from Nairobi with acts from Lisbon; before that, groups from Luanda and Naples hooked up in the Angolan capital; figures from Bristol (including the producer Pinch) visited Lagos; and Johannesburg hosted visitors from Kiev.</p><p>In Cairo, the duo <a href=\"http://diamondversion.info/bio/\" title=\"\">Diamond Version </a>recorded with local acts Bikya and Wetrobots and gave a concert at the Rawabet theatre. Now five counter-visits are being organised by the Ten Cities crew, starting with a visit to Naples by Angolan producers DJ Satelite and MC Sacer. It is hoped that the huge amount of music being created as the project proceeds will form an album. And concurrently, all the writers involved in the project are working on a set of papers that will be collated into a book.</p><p>It is an ambitious project, but faced with the speed at which so much is changing in the global music game, it does feel necessary. Even if, as one of the participants said at one point in Nairobi, \"Man, don't think about it too much – just listen to the way it sounds!\"</p><p>• Details: <a href=\"http://facebook.com/tencities.social\" title=\"\">facebook.com/tencities.social</a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2013/7/5/1373035740329/Just-a-Band-s-Bill--Blink-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/07/ten-cities-europe-africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/2013/jul/07/ten-cities-europe-africa","sectionName":"Music"},{"webTitle":"Cassava on eBay?

Yet these farmers labour under severe handicaps: remoteness from markets; lack of storage, seed and fertilisers; and weak bargaining power with buyers. A lack of information, particularly on prices, puts smallholders at a disadvantage.</p><p><a href=\"http://mfarm.co.ke/about\" title=\"\">M-Farm</a>, a Kenyan company co-founded in 2010, seeks to redress the balance in favour of smallholder farmers by addressing what co-founder Jamila Abass calls \"asymmetry of information\" – and make money in the process.</p><p>Abass created M-Farm with Susan Oguya and Linda Kwamnoka, inspired to act by stories about the exploitation of smallholders by middlemen offering meagre prices.</p><p>\"The exploitation of farmers is not new, it has been going on for a long time. We wanted to focus on agriculture and the challenges farmers had and the possibility of bringing about change,\" said Abass, who was in London this month to attend <a href=\"http://www.africagathering.org/\" title=\"\">Africa Gathering</a>, a networking event, and to talk to supermarkets about linking them to African smallholders.</p><p>Abass, 29, one of 19 children from a poor family, left her job as a systems developer at the Kenya Medical Research Institute and joined <a href=\"http://akirachix.com/\" title=\"\">Akirachix</a>, an IT hub that brings together women and technology. The launch of M-Farm followed a €10,000 (about £8,500) investment prize.</p><p>\"The competition was meant for men, but the timing was right because the technology sector was emphasising gender equality and the empowerment of women. We were very lucky,\" she said.</p><p>The publicity helped to garner $100,000, half in grant and half in loan, from the UK charity <a href=\"http://techfortrade.org/\" title=\"\">TechforTrade</a>, which supports innovative approaches to poverty alleviation.</p><p>M-Farm provides price information to farmers. By sending an SMS, farmers can see market prices in real time for their products – cassava, groundnuts, sorghum, passion fruit – so they do not get ripped off by buyers at their farms.</p><p>The company employs 10 people in five cities – Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Kisumu and Kitale – who collect daily price information on 42 crops across Kenya. About 7,000 farmers use the service, for which M-Farm takes a tiny cut from the mobile phone provider.</p><p>M-Farm makes its money by playing the role of middleman itself. In that way, the company does not cut out intermediaries completely, but reduces the three or four layers that chip away at the smallholders' cut. M-Farm employs 18 agents who link smallholders with buyers and charges a commission of 10-15% for the service. The agent's job is to get the best price for the farmers, typically by organising them to sell collectively in groups of 20 to 120.</p><p>\"If someone sells via M-Farm, they register with us details of the produce they want to sell and we charge a commission. It's similar to eBay,\" said Abass, adding that M-Farm has increased the prices its farmers have received.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-412628553'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/6/27/1372328350366/MDG--Kenya-tech-firm-tell-006.jpg' alt='MDG : Kenya tech firm tells farmers the real price of their produce : M-Farm market place' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Screengrab of Kenyan M-Farm market place with vegetables and their price, 27 June 2013.

About 5,000 farmers are using M-Farm as a middleman. The advantage for farmers is that they can count on a reliable buyer.</p><p>\"We are having to turn down farmers who want to join our service because we can't find enough buyers,\" said Abass. \"Spreading ourselves too thinly would be really risky for us.\"</p><p>This is why M-Farm is seeking to forge relationships with UK supermarkets. Supermarkets have a reputation for driving down the prices of their UK suppliers, but Abass says they could help smallholder farmers in Kenya.</p><p>\"Farmers in the UK have the luxury to complain about Tesco,\" she said. \"But in Kenya, if Tesco wanted to buy from farmers, it would double the price Kenyan farmers would receive and make a huge difference in boosting their livelihoods. We are not short of farmers, we need buyers. What is lacking is the market itself.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/6/27/1372340934044/MDG-M-Farm-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jul/04/m-farm-kenya-food-security","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/jul/04/m-farm-kenya-food-security","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Dealing with uncertainty: the insurance industry and climate change","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-01T11:48:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/insurance-industry-climate-change","fields":{"body":"<p>Bad weather does a lot more than spoil barbecues.

The climate is changing and as the sector responsible for managing risk and how it is mitigated… the insurance industry does play a big part.\"</p><p>The industry is starting to recognise this. The CII incorporates the issue into its qualifications and continuing professional development resources for its members, while a number of insurers got together six years ago to set up the <a href=\"http://www.climatewise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">ClimateWise</a> leadership group to work together investigating the issue.</p><p>The group's members have recognised that the number of extreme weather events and other climate-linked changes have significant implications for their businesses, said Katharine Thoday, head of the ClimateWise secretariat at the <a href=\"http://www.cpsl.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">University of Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership</a>. The group has set up <a href=\"http://www.climatewise.org.uk/storage/The%20ClimateWise%20Principles.pdf\" title=\"\">six principles</a>, including informing public policy, incorporating climate change into members' investment strategies and reducing the environmental impacts of their business.</p><p>One of the underlying challenges is that climate change is still far from fully understood, meaning that companies are always dealing with uncertainty, said Dr Stefan Straub, <a href=\"http://www.munichre.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Munich Re's</a> spokesman on climate change and renewable energy. \"No one can say 'that's the last piece of the puzzle'. The research is still going on. We still don't know enough, which makes it difficult to assess the risks in the right way.\" It funds or is otherwise involved in a large number of research initiatives to help improve understanding of the issues involved, as well as supporting the development of renewable energy technology.</p><p>Knowledge may not yet be complete but it is improving, said Jon Williams, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, which reviews insurers' performance against the ClimateWise principles. The industry is making the most progress in research and development and risk modelling, engagement with policymakers, and product innovation, he said. \"For example, in the UK 10 years ago flood-risk modelling was a high-level crude postcode lottery,\" he said. \"Now it's sub-postcode mapping of how water will flow across terrain.\"</p><p>Companies are also starting to create products that try to change consumer behaviour, said Williams. Aviva's <a href=\"http://www.aviva.co.uk/car/?qreferer=/car-insurance/index.htm\" title=\"\">\"pay as you drive\"</a> policy, which means heavy car users pay higher premiums than those who drive for short distances, is one example; another is the way in which insurers make assets more resilient to risk after they have had to pay out. \"So in a flood-risk area, expect to have your power points reinstalled 24 inches up so that if it floods again it won't take out all your electrics.\"</p><p>But the picture is not all positive. For a start, there is still much more that could be done to develop new products that help mitigate risk, said Williams. \"And another area where relatively little has been done is understanding the risks of climate change to those more exposed to them, especially in developing countries.\" This is becoming increasingly important as insurers look to these markets for new opportunities for growth now that the UK market is saturated – Williams' pun.</p><p>\"What that does is take them into markets where governments are typically less able to adapt to climate change so risks are higher, and much higher for insurers,\" he said.</p><p>Even insurers with no direct involvement in developing markets need to understand the issues there, he said. \"About a third of premiums insured in this market come from overseas so they are already exposed to overseas. Secondly, the world is pretty connected and the biggest threat to the UK from climate change is through the supply chain, particularly through food security.\" A British insurer that offers business continuity insurance to a company based in the UK could easily be exposed to climate change risks down the line, for example if a drought in Kenya wiped out a major supplier's crop.</p><p>He also believes that insurers need to think harder about what they can do with their asset portfolios. This is a tricky area, said Thoday. \"The outside perception is that, because insurers from the underwriting side have been thinking about these issues… there's a strong sense that they should be applying it to their investments,\" she said. \"In reality as a business those two things are very separate. For all kinds of regulatory reasons you don't share your risk analysis from the underwriting side with the investment decision side.\" That said, this is a question that's starting to get on the agenda of the investment side, she added.</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The project will cost more than $600m (53bn Kenyan shillings/£400m) and implementation will begin this year.</p><p></p><p>This is not simply a procurement issue or a small part of a larger educational strategy. It is the strategy. The budget, released this month, <a href=\"http://www.citizennews.co.ke/news/2012/local/item/11232-budget-2013-2014-speech-by-henry-rotich\" title=\"\">claims</a> that the government \"has prioritised transforming the educational system to e-teaching and e-learning\". By contrast, the budget contained only 34.7bn shillings for healthcare, and 67bn for the police. In a country with extremely limited financial resources, this is a very bold move.</p><p></p><p>In some ways, the strategy seems to reinforce the image of Kenya as Africa's digital heart. The country has embedded digital services in its <a href=\"http://www.vision2030.go.ke\" title=\"\">national development plan</a>, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/03/kalonzo-musyoka-technology-city-kenya\" title=\"\">building a technology park</a> dubbed \"<a href=\"http://newmatilda.com/2013/06/14/kenyas-silicon-savannah\" title=\"\">silicon Savannah</a>\", is a pioneer in creating digital services and software (such as the M-Pesa mobile money transfer system and the <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/about-us\" title=\"\">Ushahidi crisis reporting platform</a>), and has one of the highest internet penetration rates on the continent.</p><p></p><p>But Kenya is characterised by deep economic inequalities. In the shadow of Nairobi's gleaming skyscrapers are millions of people who live in poverty. <a href=\"http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=ke&amp;v=69\" title=\"\">About half</a> the country's 41 million people live below the national poverty line, and measures including the Gini coefficient show <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality\" title=\"\">large gaps between rich and poor</a>. More than 15 million Kenyans <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/kenya/overview_4616.html\" title=\"\">still don't have access to safe water or sanitation</a>.</p><p></p><p>Despite free primary education, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/kenya/overview_4616.html\" title=\"\">more than 1 million Kenyan children of school age aren't attending classes</a>. Having a well-educated population is without doubt a way for the country to help itself out of poverty. But is betting the farm on e-teaching and e-learning a sensible strategy? More importantly, is it an equitable or just development approach?</p><p></p><p>Many of the project's specifics have yet to emerge, but there are still some important points to be made.</p><p></p><p>First, laptops alone won't solve any of the structural and social issues – including a lack of trained teachers, intermittent power supplies and thousands of malnourished children – facing Kenya.</p><p></p><p>Irrespective of how many stories we hear about the effectiveness of laptops being <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/506466/given-tablets-but-no-teachers-ethiopian-children-teach-themselves/\" title=\"\">dropped off to villages</a> in rural Africa – the approach adopted by One Laptop per Child's Nicholas Negroponte, for instance – <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/4988289\" title=\"\">technology alone cannot provide an education</a>. Among other things, children still need functioning schools, electricity and, crucially, trained teachers – tens of thousands are required, according to the <a href=\"http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000085935&amp;story_title=Kenya-teachers-cry-foul-after-treasury-snubs-demands/\" title=\"\">Kenya National Union of Teachers</a>.</p><p></p><p>Second, information and communication technologies are an <a href=\"https://edutechdebate.org/ict-in-schools/there-are-no-technology-shortcuts-to-good-education/\" title=\"\">amplifier of capabilities, skills, and social and economic positions</a>. Supporters of education projects based on laptop distribution often point to their success in connecting the previously disconnected. But while information technologies and the communication networks that link them are fantastic tools for people with the existing knowledge, skills and social networks to take advantage of them, they are less useful to those starting from a less privileged position. It is hard to see how the programme could do anything to address inequality without tackling its deeper roots.</p><p></p><p>Third, there is a long history of people and states framing technology as a solution to economic, social, political and environmental problems. IT becomes intertwined with notions of modernity and progress. Naively, they are seen not just as a tool, but as a panacea for development. Kenya's laptop project shows us how powerful these visions can be. Why get involved in the messy business of hiring thousands of teachers, building functioning schools, creating a stable electricity supply, and ensuring that all children are well-nourished, when laptops and e-learning will thrust the country into the digital economy?</p><p></p><p>Increased access to IT undoubtedly holds much promise for some of Kenya's youth. But the worry is that the resources invested in the project could have been better spent. Policymakers in other low-income countries will undoubtedly be watching closely; we need to ask who will ultimately benefit from the project and who may get left behind.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/6/21/1371818286994/MDG--Computer-for-student-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jun/27/kenya-laptops-schools","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jun/27/kenya-laptops-schools","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Being a fair but tough judge - International Development Journalism Awards 2013","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-25T14:49:09Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/25/being-a-fair-but-tough-judge-international-development-journalism-awards-2013","fields":{"body":"<p>This year I've been lucky enough to be one of the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development-professionals-network/international-development-journalism-competition\">International Development Journalism Competition</a> judges, which means I have had my first insight into what it is like to \"judge\". </p><p>From <a href=\"http://talent.itv.com/\">Britain's Got Talent</a> to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nnfdd\">The Voice</a>, there is no shortage of television devoted to \"judging\" in the UK these days.  A new Channel 4 programme called <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-greatest-shows-on-earth\">The Greatest Shows on Earth</a> travels around the world and finds most audiences glued to their televisions watching shows that all involve \"judging\", whether it's for dancing, simple physique or other fantastic acts. In Kenya, my cousins regularly watch both the Kenyan and Nigerian <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/NigerianIdol\">Pop Idol</a>. And these programmes have an impact – a singer from Gaza just won <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23017923\">Arab Idol</a>, prompting mass celebrations in Gaza City and East Jerusalem.</p><p>In all these programmes, even if there is active participation such as live voting, audiences still tend to rely on a set of experts in their fields to help determine who's best and who deserves to eventually win. I find the experts quite interesting, as I often totally misread what sort of judgement they will give. I usually have little idea what to look out for.</p><p>This time, although an expert in my own field with my background in development and my experience of blogging – I nevertheless found it difficult to work out what to look out for. As a newcomer I had very little idea of the quality of articles that would be submitted. I wondered whether I'd become a caricature of a judge. Perhaps like Simon Cowell – harsh and critical, but overly gushing when I saw great quality? Or I might be more like Will-I-Am – eccentric and random, but with a good eye for talent. I wasn't sure. But as I began reading the entries, I realised that I had to rely on a few pointers – three in fact – to really detect the great pieces.</p><p>The first sign I looked out for was, like a judge on \"The Voice\" might, some depth. The article needed to have a strong degree of understanding of development issues and political challenges, beyond simply giving out aid or doing business. I looked for pieces that were rooted in personal experience – as that often showed that the writer understood that people in low-income or war-torn countries are no different in terms of their needs and aspirations compared to people in countries such as the UK.</p><p>The second sign of a top article was its degree of journalism.  That might sound rather obvious, but I did see some pieces that simply reported about one project, or simply included some relevant global statistics before launching into a discussion about project outcomes or a think-piece about an issue. In my mind, these kinds of approaches were not journalistic enough. A great journalist would show signs of being inquisitive – searching websites like <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> or <a href=\"http://www.aidgrade.org/\">AidGrade</a> to look at and compare the results of similar projects, including in other countries. They would use this information to illuminate what was special about this particular project or a particular political situation, providing statistics that are more specific to the country or set of people affected.  I wanted to see curious and critical minds reveal themselves.</p><p>Last but not least, the third sign I looked for was a unique narrative. As those who are familiar with the competition will know, entries are usually invited along several \"themes\". There were 12 themes this year, ranging from disability and women's empowerment to the role of China in the global health agenda.  Such themes are useful, as they help writers identify the major and most relevant issues, but they can also be problematic by inviting fairly well trodden, over-simplistic narratives. For example, I looked for articles that weren't just excited about the potential for new technology, but forecast new challenges and risks of failure that such technology might face.  I looked for articles that examined some of the cultural and political elements of gender-based violence, rather than simply reporting it.  Such articles would help readers think about the future for development, not just reminisce about the horrors or pleasures of the past.</p><p>With these three pointers, I felt equipped enough to judge the entrants. But what I hadn't anticipated was a final quality, which – having watched enough Saturday night television – I should have expected to search for. It was their \"wow\" quality, or, their \"X-Factor\". Some of the articles I read just blew me away and defied any simple categorisation. </p><p>I'm looking forward to the next stage - where my fellow judges and I will whittle down the Top 12 to just one winner - with both excitement and fear in equal measure. Picking the winner will be like asking my cousins to decide whether the Nigerian, Kenyan, UK or Arab Pop Idol winner is best overall… I'm sure it's going to be incredibly close!</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/25/1372170816667/Hannah-Ryder-001.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/25/being-a-fair-but-tough-judge-international-development-journalism-awards-2013","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/25/being-a-fair-but-tough-judge-international-development-journalism-awards-2013","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"Are the Pacific islands ripe for mobile money?","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-19T14:07:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network/dai-partner-zone","id":"global-development-professionals-network/dai-partner-zone/pacific-islands-ripe-for-mobile-money","fields":{"body":"<p>Characterised by a young, poor, and isolated population with a strong need for basic financial services and fast-growing usage of mobile phones, the Pacific island countries - 14 islands spread over 30 million square kilometres - seemed to be a perfect place to develop mobile financial services when the <a href=\"http://www.pfip.org/\"rel=\"nofollow\">Pacific Financial Inclusion programme</a> (PFIP) started in 2008. Successive assessments found that:</p><p>• In 2008, an estimated 6.6 million out of the 10 million Pacific islanders had no access to financial services.<br />• 36% of inhabitants were less than 15 years old.<br />• Millions of people transacted only in cash, with all the expense and risk such transactions entail.<br />• Pacific islanders were highly dependent on international and domestic remittances, due in part to the high rate of unemployment (one salaried person for every 15 to 20 family members).<br />• Mobile phone usage is growing fast: in Samoa, approximately 165,500 people gained access to a mobile phone between 2002 and 2010 (90% of the population); in Fiji, 95% of the country had mobile coverage by 2010; and in Papua New Guinea, mobile phone subscriptions rose from 100,000 to 1.5 million in just the last two and a half years. </p><p>Funded by the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the European Commission, and AusAID, PFIP has a core mission to \"bring new energy and ideas on financial inclusion and financial literacy to the Pacific.\" Armed with the findings of its initial assessment, PFIP naturally turned to mobile money and branchless banking as a way to reach out to financially excluded Pacific islanders. Most notably, the project worked with regulators to improve the regulatory environment for financial services, which led to the creation of national financial inclusion task forces or microfinance units, and put financial inclusion high on the policy agenda in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu. PFIP's direct grants to private companies have also created public-private partnerships that transformed the branchless banking industry profile in the Pacific. </p><p>Since 2010, 11 branchless or mobile banking deployments have gone live in six countries:</p><p>• In Fiji, Vodafone Fiji and Post Fiji recently partnered to offer mobile money services through postal outlets and Fijians now use their M-Paisa accounts to pay for local bus service.<br />• In Papua New Guinea, MiLife now offers the first mobile microinsurance scheme in the South Pacific.<br />• In six countries, PFIP is teaming up with Westpac Bank to introduce 'in-store' banking, where clients can withdraw and deposit money, pay bills, and receive and make transfers through trained banking agents equipped with point-of-sale devices.<br />• In Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, and Vanuatu, Digicel Pacific introduced a low-cost, phone-based mobile wallet.<br />• In Fiji, a government-to-person (or G2P) project converted low-income clients, mostly women, to an electronic payment system with no-cost bank accounts.<br />• In Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa, Digicel Pacific partners with Klickex Corporation, a mobile transfer operator, to offer low-cost international remittances directly to a mobile wallet.</p><p><strong>Pacific islands: the next Kenya?</strong></p><p>So, if Pacific islanders now have access to technology allowing them to send, receive, and save money, withdraw cash, top up their mobile phones, pay bills, make direct purchases in shops, and even pay their bus fares, are the Pacific island countries the next big thing in mobile money? Not really - or at least not yet. Because so few of the potential clients for mobile money actually use it. </p><p>A 2012 PFIP market survey on <a href=\"http://www.pfip.org/resources/uploads/attachments/documents/Omnibus_Survey_Findings.pdf\"rel=\"nofollow\">mobile money attitudes and perceptions in Fiji </a>(conducted on 1,020 households, with representatives from various ethnic, age, and gender backgrounds) reveals that the slow growth of mobile money is due to a persistent gap between awareness of the service and understanding of its relevance. While the price of transactions does not appear to be a limiting factor, even among lower-income users, the following findings stand out:</p><p>• Most of those surveyed knew of the mobile money services yet didn't feel them necessary and/or didn't know how to use them.<br />• While trust in banks is high, trust in the new services is still low.<br />• People relate to products differently based on their age, gender, and location, suggesting a need for appropriate segmentation, targeting, and positioning strategies. </p><p><a href=\"http://dai.com/news-publications/news/qa-dai%E2%80%99s-brigit-helms-benefits-bringing-mobile-banking-unbanked?utm_campaign=guardian\"rel=\"nofollow\">Developing mobile money services is complicated</a>. It involves strong partnerships between mobile network operators, financial services providers, and retailers. It also implies significant investments for needs assessment, technology development and national deployment. The return on investment can be a long-run proposition: of the approximately 150 mobile money deployments worldwide, only 11 have more than 1 million subscribers and thus are on the way to full sustainability. The Pacific is following the global trend that suggests five years or more are necessary to make the service work.</p><p>Tillman Bruett, who heads mobile banking for the poor (MB4P), UNCDF's global programme on the subject, summarises the opportunities of - and threats to - mobile money in the Pacific as follows:</p><p>• Mobile phones can reach a lot of people quickly - the number of those who have registered for mobile money accounts across the Pacific is creeping toward 1 million.<br />• Getting people to use and trust the system takes time - only about 5% of registered customers actually use the service, which is not far from the global average.<br />• At the same time, mobile network operators need to see some growth in the next few years as an incentive to invest further in offering the service.<br />• Regulator support is crucial - and Pacific regulators have been highly supportive.</p><p>PFIP is not putting all its eggs in the mobile money basket. The project has supported several banks which are now making significant progress in reaching the unbanked. Westpac and Bank of the South Pacific, for example, offer a simple low-cost bank account with quick-issue debit cards and dedicated agents. Collectively, these bank solutions are now reaching nearly 150,000 Pacific islanders, most of whom were previously unbanked. In fact, the banks seem to be having an easier time getting clients to be active than mobile phone companies. Clients, it seems, accept formal savings more readily than they do formal money transfers, and access to ATM networks is proving a strong draw. Increasingly, also, partnerships are emerging, linking mobile network operators with the local post office, for example, or with banks, microfinance institutions, and insurance companies. </p><p>Over time, and given effective marketing efforts, quality improvements, and a reliable network of agents, we expect to see these efforts mature and reach millions of Pacific islanders.</p><p><em>Emmanuel Moyart and Mathilde Gaston-Mathé are the technical assistance team of the <a href=\"http://dai.com/our-work/projects/african-caribbean-and-pacific%E2%80%93european-union-microfinance-programme?utm_source=guardian\"rel=\"nofollow\">Africa Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)/European Union Microfinance programme</a> – an EC-funded programme to develop sustainable access to finance in ACP countries.

With the disaster areas lacking fixed-line telephones information had to be communicated by telex from the capital (or frequently, to avoid censorship, from neighbouring Kenya).</p><p>Such communication difficulties meant that a usual early predictor of African famine, the plummeting of livestock prices, was missed. The first warning signs of the disaster came when peasants left their land by the thousand in search of relief, by which time it was, generally, too late.</p><p>Thirty years on, such a communications blackout is almost unthinkable. For example, grim as the refugee situation in Syria and neighbouring countries is today, at least some instant communication channels are open to the outside world. Thanks to mobile telephones, the internet and social media – all unknown in the 1980s – information from relief workers and the combatants streams continuously into the public domain.</p><p>Better communication technology is also playing its part in preventing disasters. Earlier this year, Sierra Leone – still recovering from a long-running civil war and cholera outbreak that killed hundreds last year – set up a mobile technology initiative aimed at saving children's lives.</p><p>An innovative location-targeted SMS system called the <a href=\"http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/beneficiary-communications/tera/\" title=\"\">Trilogy Emergency Relief Application</a> (Tera), set up by the Red Cross with help from mobile communications providers, will be able to flash messages to 36,000 people an hour at the touch of a button. The idea is to disseminate information on new disease outbreaks and other emergencies, such as fires or floods.</p><p>The first use of Tera in Sierra Leone is to spread information on preventing malaria, which claims more than 16,000 lives in the country every year.</p><p>\"We can use it to warn people when emergencies or outbreaks start and to give them vital information on preventing diseases like malaria and cholera,\" says Sharon Reader, project manager at the Red Cross.</p><p>\"Even better, Tera is a two-way system so we can quickly assess the areas with the greatest need after an emergency, and respond to requests for information on a large scale. Harnessing technology in this way is really helping the Red Cross to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our aid operations.\"</p><p>Sierra Leone is the second country in the world to install the Tera SMS system. Mobile messaging's value was demonstrated in Haiti, following the earthquake in 2010. In the aftermath of the disaster, the Red Cross sent out more than 45m texts to subscribers of the local mobile network Voila.</p><p>Followup studies showed that of the people who had received such a message, 95% reported that they found the information useful and 90% changed something in their lives or made some kind of preparation as a result. Advice on health and hurricane preparedness was the most highly valued, remembered and shared. This suggests that even in a population as poor as Haiti's, consumer technology can be relevant to people's needs.</p><p>Promising as such initiatives are, the potential of information technology to prevent and respond to disasters is far from being fully realised. A study published by the <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Save the Children</a> charity, and sponsored by the <a href=\"http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/about/foundation.html\" title=\"\">Vodafone Foundation</a>, last year called for more efforts to prepare technology and procedures before disaster strikes.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/resources/online-library/mobile-technology-emergencies\" title=\"\">Mobile Technology in Emergencies</a> report concluded that mobile phones can be used for assessing needs, enabling rapid mass communications and improving transparency through feedback and complaints.</p><p>In Bangladesh, for example, where mobile phones are used broadly across the country, systems for communication in emergencies such as floods have now been established.</p><p>\"Mobiles are working very well, because SMS can be sent quickly in an emergency situation,\" the report says.</p><p>\"In emergency response this has enormous potential, as there are some areas where TV and radio is not available. A field worker can send an SMS to colleagues and they can ask for people to spread it to others and get the message to the remote corners of the country.\"</p><p>However, the Save the Children report concludes that in much of the developing world such use of mobiles \"is hampered by a lack of collaboration and knowledge-sharing between humanitarian agencies, network operators and governments\".</p><p>One problem is that mobile networks are themselves vulnerable in disasters. Even when power supplies and base stations are not damaged by earthquake or flood, networks can collapse through overload.</p><p>Meanwhile, people most affected by disaster are generally those with least access to mobile telephones – the very poorest, women and people who are unable to read.</p><p>The report calls on governments to recognise communications as an essential component of response efforts: following disasters \"the restoration of mobile networks should be regarded as a life-saving humanitarian priority\".</p><p>Most important, the report recommends field testing of the proposed solutions, assessing viability and engaging directly with beneficiaries – before the next disaster strikes.</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

This growth has, of course, gone hand-in-hand with major expansion by international companies in emerging markets. News in the financial sector has been full of reports of increased presence and investment in Africa and other regions by technology and telecommunications giants including Microsoft, Intel, IBM and Google.</p><p>For UNICEF, understanding this explosion has been paramount, as children and young people have been leading the uptake in access to digital. Since 2010, through the Voices of Youth Citizens initiative, UNICEF and its partners have been examining the opportunities and risks that the digital explosion presents for children's rights, and advocating for safe and responsible use.</p><p>One of the recurring realities in a number of countries is that not only are children and youth the greatest users of digital tools, in many cases they learn how to use them with very little support from parents or teachers. A study conducted by UNICEF Argentina showed that almost two-thirds of children surf the internet unsupervised, while a study exploring the digital habits of adolescents in Kenya found that only 15% of respondents had learnt to use the internet from their parents. In many cases parents, caregivers and teachers do not feel they are sufficiently equipped to provide guidance to their children as they discover the digital world.</p><p>In this context it is clear that there is a very significant role that private sector can, and should, play in helping to raise awareness of safe and responsible use of digital tools, and to empower young users to negotiate the online world safely. This also presents exciting opportunities for collaboration between the private sector, child-rights organisations such as UNICEF, and governments, to use evidence to design outreach and campaigns based on a common understanding that with the right support structures in place, the benefits of the digital world outweigh the risks.</p><p>And there are already effective examples of this from around the world. In 2012, UNICEF South Africa partnered with Google South Africa and other governmental and non-governmental agencies to localise Google's online family safety centre to meet the country's realities. More recently, UNICEF Argentina, in partnership with Fibertel corporation, Cablevision and NGO Chicos.net, launched an online portal, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.programacompas.com.ar/\" title=\"\">Compas para el uso de internet</a>, with resources for teachers, parents, and children to equip them with tips and advice to maximise the online experience, and a game which helps children to evaluate their online behaviour.</p><p>In Ukraine, UNICEF has partnered with top digital agency Smartica/Skykillers and the country's largest social network, VKontakte,  to design and implement a campaign aimed at the young users of the social network. An interactive application and video engages users and promotes critical thinking on issues of online reputation and personal safety. On a global level, through the Voices of Youth online community, UNICEF shares resources and tools to galvanise children and young people to promote digital citizenship among their peers, recognising the important role that children themselves can play in protecting themselves and their friends online.</p><p>As more and more young people connect online, we need to work together to ensure that not only are they aware of how to reduce their risk of harm online, they are fully empowered to take advantage of the opportunities that the digital world offers for their education, development and civic participation.</p><p><em>Gerrit Beger, chief of UNICEF social and civic media section, division of communications.

They are consumers, they are the children of employees and customers and they are young workers, future employees and business leaders. Today's children and youth have been born into a digital world; they are exposed to technology and innovation and are avid users of new information and communication technologies (ICTs).</p><p>Technological innovation has advanced in unprecedented ways over the past decade. Although access to information and communication technology is not equal across different countries, regions and socioeconomic groups, the landscape is changing rapidly. On the one hand the rise of social media and mobile technology can provide powerful networking platforms for peer to peer education and can empower young people to express their views and demand their rights. On the other hand digital technology creates security risks for children and young people: it can threaten their right to privacy; children and youth are reached with inappropriate content; and they are the victims of online exploitation, harassment and bullying.</p><p>The ICT sector has a wide range of potential positive and negative impact on children's rights and that is why this sector is of particular importance to UNICEF in an effort to consider the impact of business behaviour on children's rights and aim to harness the resources of this industry to promote the rights of children.</p><h2>Moving from reactive to proactive: how can ICT companies further support and respect children's rights?</h2><p>UNICEF has a long-standing experience engaging with companies to deliver results for children through a wide range of interactions including fundraising and programmatic collaboration. More recently, UNICEF is working with companies, including in the ICT sector to support them in advancing child rights throughout their business operations, value chain and spheres of influence in the workplace, marketplace and broader community.</p><p>Recognising a need for explicit guidance on what it means for business to fulfill their duties on children's rights, the UN Global Compact, Save the Children and UNICEF led a process that led to the release of the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.unicef.org/csr/47.htm\" title=\"\">Children's Rights and Business Principles</a> in March 2012. They articulate the responsibility of business to respect – doing the minimum required to avoid infringing on children's rights; and the commitment to support – taking voluntary actions that seek to advance the realisation of children's rights.</p><p>UNICEF has also recently produced a set of practical tools. These include guidance on developing relevant corporate policies that address children's rights; conducting impact assessments; integrating appropriate programmes and systems; and monitoring and reporting on children's rights.</p><h2>Walking the talk: how the ICT sector can take action</h2><p>A number of ICT companies are focused on protecting young workers and combating child labour in the workplace. UNICEF and Telenor Group recently joined forces to combat child labour in Bangladesh by providing through a combination of activities targeting working children through social workers. Millicom is another example of an international telecom company wanting to better understand its impact on child rights and thereby made use of the Children's Rights Checklist developed by UNICEF to begin identifying how to address its impact on children.</p><p>Addressing issues in the marketplace, ICT companies are taking actions to address child online protection or to market products and services keeping in mind the best interests of the child. For instance, Vodafone devised a \"top tips\" pocket guide for parents, as part of its child safety customer education initiative. The guide provides recommendations on a number of areas including chat, games, premium rate services and how to address bullying.</p><p>Finally, ICT companies are addressing children's rights in the local communities where they operate, by scaling up programmatic collaboration in support of national development priorities. For example, Safaricom is working with UNICEF Kenya to apply its Short Message Service (SMS) services to send bulk SMS mailings on hand washing to their over 14 million subscriber base. Another mobile operator in Thailand, Digital Total Access Communications (DTAC), joined forces with UNICEF to launch the \"best start\" initiative, which will provide free mobile information services to promote the health of mothers and children.</p><p>Although the industry shows greater engagement by taking action in raising awareness on the optimal and safe use of new technologies, as well as building a protective environment for children, a number of challenges still need to be addressed.</p><p>Business has a contribution to make, but so does government, in regulating and promoting business actions to address their impacts on children's rights.  In 2011, in response to a request from the UK Government, a report, Letting Children be Children, was published with recommendations, one of which stated that internet service providers (ISPs), public WIFI providers, retailers, device manufacturers and mobile internet services should make it easier for parents to block adult and age-restricted material from the internet. This process inspired the four main fixed-line ISPs (BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media) to create an Open Internet Code of Practice.</p><p>Last but not least, consumers themselves have a role to play in demanding that companies take their responsibility towards children's rights as seriously as they take the making of financial gains for their shareholders.</p><p><em>For further information, please contact your nearest UNICEF office or National Committee for UNICEF or email the Corporate Social Responsibility Unit at csr@unicef.org.</em></p><p><em>Bo Viktor Nylund is senior advisor, corporate social responsibility at Unicef.</em></p><p><em>Copy on this page is provided by UNICEF, supporter of the </em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/child-rights-business\" title=\"\"><em>children: the next business agenda hub</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/14/1371227490879/INDIAN-SCHOOL-CHILDREN-US-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/technology-companies-tackle-impact-children","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/technology-companies-tackle-impact-children","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"Observer Ethical Awards 2013: Queen Elizabeth II High School 'Grow Your Own Clothes' – Ecover Young Green Champions","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-15T23:07:29Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2013/jun/16/observer-ethical-awards-grow-clothes","fields":{"body":"<p>Teenagers know the power of fast fashion.

The recent collapse of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/bangladesh-factory-building-collapse-community\" title=\"\">Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh</a> was a reminder of that. Still, the reality is that young people won't stop shopping in this way. \"There are ranges of ethical clothing out there, but the prices are  unrealistic for student budgets. These are pieces that require investment,\" adds Grace, 17.</p><p>Inspired to find ethical alternatives that still fit into the fast-fashion concept, 10 months ago the group launched its project, which sees them growing their own clothes using green tea, sugar and bacteria. \"We came up with the idea after we saw a BBC news article by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18301669\" title=\"\">fashion designer Suzanne Lee</a> [a researcher in biomaterials at Central Saint Martins],\" says Grace.</p><p>The first experiment was in a plastic box. Within a few weeks they had grown a vegetable leather fabric which they have used to make garments including skirts, waistcoats, an apron and a neutral-coloured hat: \"You can mould the fabric over a mannequin and it will grow seams, so you don't need stitching.\"</p><p>The next step is experimenting with natural dyes, such as beetroot and red onion, then pattern. \"We're studying sciences and have found that you can lay metals on the fabric which, when they oxidise, will turn those areas black.\"</p><p>They believe only some of the current items are wearable by teenage sartorial standards. \"You could definitely wear the hat,\" says Grace. \"I would wear it on holiday. But the point is really to show potential at this stage. We have created clothing that is ethically produced using natural ingredients. It is sustainable and biodegradable. Imagine, with the time and investment, the stage it could get to.\"</p><p>The group also hopes its project, by way of being a novel concept, will help communicate a message. \"It sounds strange to grow your own clothes, so we hope the idea will gain enough publicity for people to think harder about  the consequences of the clothes they buy,\" says Millie. \"Not many people know that producing polyester uses a lot of crude oil or that cotton requires a lot of water.

He ignores the corruption, the innumerable deaths, Mugabe's part in the war in Congo that cost so many lives and only enriched his henchmen, the disappearance not only of people but most of education and development in rural Zimbabwe, to mention just a few things. The system Mugabe replaced with a one-party set-up had opened up voting for blacks, the first university was multiracial then and closed most of the time now because the students are vigorously against him.</p><p>The white farmers had bought their farms from the Mugabe government, after having done all the development in the first place, the same as in Kenya, where they were not been evicted afterwards; nothing like the kind of murderous violence and destruction that was done by Mugabe's thugs occurred there.</p><p>During one post-independence visit some years ago, when one independent (black) newspaper was still allowed and its (equally black) reporters had not yet fled the country to save their lives, as most of the others had had to do, we bought one copy that we have kept since.

I agree: the French language has been under threat lately, but not from the borrowing of any foreign word. Any language will shine by and dazzle with what it produces, but sadly, we have made nihilistic literature our speciality, to cite only literature.</p><p>I still cannot figure out why our critics bask in such books as the ones by Michel Houellebecq or Christine Angot, to name but two authors. Reading the last by Angot, the depiction in minute detail of an incest, one realises that Marcel Pagnol and the nostalgia of his childhood are definitively over, as is the wit of Astérix. The enthusiasts of the French language, like Claude Hagège, mainly regret that French is not in the dominant position – our lost American future. Hagège states that English implies economic liberalism, and hence the capitalism bias. But this thesis forgets that English also was the language of Henry David Thoreau and Emily Dickinson.</p><p>Now, with the possible new law, I would rather be concerned about the poor English that French university professors might soon impose on their students: oh no ...<br /><strong>Marc Jachym</strong><br />Paris, France</p><p>• The historical irony of the French tongue is that, were it not for imperialistic Latin, it would have turned out something like Breton or Gaelic (or even possibly German, judging from appropriated nouns). Romance French began as a Latin superimposed on the subjugated (and preliterate) Celts. And, were it not for Julius Caesar's scribe's ear, we would have no first record of Celtic culture: no Lutetia (Paris), no plucky chieftains like Vercingetorix and Dumnorix, nor any British Boudicca, druids and naked warriors in woad. And alas, no Astérix and Obelix, sprung from Goscinny's head.</p><p>Andrew Gallix (delightfully Astérixesque name, that) formidably defends besieged French as a medium of instruction against the steamroller of American English, but quixotically. Even former African colonies are beginning to relinquish French pedagogy for English. Like Latin, French is fated to become an antiquarian, literary language, a historical cul-de-sac, its vestiges living on through English (as Latin lives on through French).</p><p>Marianne Faithfull saw it coming on in the 80s: \"Don't say it in Russian, don't say it in German, say it in – broken English.\"<br /><strong>R M Fransson</strong><br />Denver, Colorado, US</p><p></p><h2><strong>Humans are the real danger</strong><br /></h2><p>Your article on New Zealand's attitude to cats highlights the fact that \"pests\" have become the villains for continuing loss of both fauna and flora <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/cat-wars-break-out-in-new-zealand/2013/05/10/3b044fee-b971-11e2-b94c-b684dda07add_story.html\" title=\"\">(Not so cool for Kiwi cats, 24&nbsp;May)</a>.

His most recent project, Means of Exchange, looks at how emerging, everyday technologies can be used to democratise opportunities for economic self-sufficiency, rebuild local community and promote a return to local resource use, leading us to a better, fairer, more locally connected world.</p><p><em>Technological innovation is something of a double-edged sword when we think about its impact, and role, in stimulating local economies. Today's globalised world has been largely made possible by innovations in technology – more recently the mobile phone and the internet. We can now purchase and consume cheaper and cheaper products from further and further away, enjoying beans from Kenya and bananas from the West Indies all year round, and communicate 24/7 with strangers in countries we've never visited. What we've been left with is a world where global dominates local, where anything happening anywhere else is more important than what's happening on our doorstep, and countless communities of people less and less connected with local resources, local businesses and each other.</em></p><p><em>The very same technologies, if used innovatively and with imagination, can reverse that decline. Online maps, location-based services, mobile apps and social media can all help bring people's attention and behaviour back towards one of local consumption and engagement. Local currencies, which are already in use in a number of towns across the UK, can help keep money in local economies, and </em><a href=\"http://www.letslinkuk.net/\" title=\"\"><em>LETS schemes</em></a><em> encourage people to use their time and skills as a kind of currency. Barter exchanges, clothes swaps and community gardens can also help bring people back together and help build resilience at community level. Technology can help drive awareness and engagement, and promote convenience, in all of these activities.</em></p><p><em>That said, many of these kinds of initiative are nothing new. Most have been around for years, and there are countless success stories out there if you look hard enough. The majority of these pockets of success have remained small in scale, though, and many only work because a small number of dedicated local activists work hard to keep them going. What's more, the people that take part are often the ones who are already converted to the cause, or older members of a community already sympathetic to the local agenda. As is often the case, it's innovation at behavioural level that's most challenging. It rarely has anything to do with technology.</em></p><p><em>Means of Exchange hopes to understand why so many existing initiatives fail to replicate and scale, building the community needed to bring in \"new blood\", and bringing in the skills required to leverage digital tools that allow for meaningful scale. What we need to do is highlight approaches that work, and tease out the factors that make them succeed. We also need to understand how social media and mobile technologies could strengthen these activities, explore gamification techniques and consult experts to understand how activities should be branded and marketed for mass appeal. There is huge potential in using technology to stimulate behaviours which can lead to local economic development, but much of it is yet to be realised.\"</em></p><p></p><p><strong>Rob Hopkins</strong> is an Ashoka fellow and founder of the <a href=\"http://www.transitionnetwork.org/\" title=\"\">Transition Network</a>. He believes in three principles: take action, go local and incentivise every person to find practical solutions. These underpin the Transition Movement he created, which tackles climate change while strengthening the capacity of communities to withstand the impact of peak oil.</p><p><em>In increasingly uncertain times, one of the key things we need to generate is community resilience. Much that is proposed in the drive for economic growth can actively undermine that resilience and evidence shows that local, independent economies contribute to local resilience significantly better than large chain businesses. </em></p><p><em>Innovation is already emerging in the form of pop-up shops, craft breweries, community renewable energy projects, complimentary currencies, transition initiatives, innovative local food businesses and urban agriculture. Stimulating our local economies needs to be founded on the concepts of resilience, enhancing local economies, being as low carbon as possible, bringing assets into community ownership where possible and of enterprises having a wider social purpose than just being for profit. </em></p><p><em>The Transition movement is modelling this around the world, showing that stimulating your local economy starts within community, rather than being somehow dictated from outside it. It is modelling the shift from a dependency on inward investment to internal investment, spending our money and investing our money in ways that build and enhance community resilience. I think that that is one of the big economic ideas of our times. </em></p><p></p><p><em>Felicity McLean (</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/flickmclean\" title=\"\"><em>@flickmclean</em></a><em>) is working on Framework Change at </em><a href=\"http://uk.ashoka.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Ashoka.</em></a></p><p></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

A gifted Mahdi imagined: \"Big railway junctions materialising from nothing, and multitudinous railway lines from all parts of the country focusing on the national Port, Berbera. The exploitation of the mineral wealth, at last achieved, and great industrial cities growing up around the newly-built factories, and the small village of Las Anod, becoming the Birmingham of the East. Hargeisa, still being the Capital, increasing in size and challenging the older cities of the world in a splendour, glory and renown.\" </p><p>Mahdi was the product of Sheikh Secondary School - the farewell gift, which the British Empire left behind for the citizens of Somaliland. The school was built on the evergreen highlands of Sheikh; a small town in the northwestern region of Somaliland. Because of its cool climate throughout the year, it was deemed as a serene and apt residence for education seekers. The British invested in this boarding school by outsourcing qualified teachers on good salaries, providing a fully equipped library and laboratories, and selecting students who were regarded to be cream of the crop. </p><p>The school gained remarkable status and was considered prestigious, similar to Eton College. A considerable number of Somaliland's prominent leaders, including the current president, Mohammed Ahmed Silanyo, were some of the early graduates in the 50s. </p><p>Unfortunately, after 56 years Somaliland is nothing like Mahdi has foreseen. The country has gone through various changeovers in the last 50 years, including a civil war, which imploded the entire region. As a result, the education system went through a period of despair. Sheikh School was not spared from the damage.  </p><p>In 2003, SOS Children's Village, an independent charity that works to protect the interest and rights of children, stepped in, once Somaliland salvaged peace. They entered into a bilateral agreement with the government to recuperate Sheikh Secondary School. The charity sponsored students through private funds from individuals. </p><p>A survey conducted by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in 2008, found that one of the main reasons for not attending secondary school are lack of school fees (73.3 percent), marriage (55.4 percent), work at home (29.2 percent). Encouragingly, Sheikh students are far from these influences and are kept in safe haven, where education is a priority. </p><p>Ahmed Shawky, 25, was one of the first students who graduated from Sheikh School after it was restored. \"Sheikh paved the way for many graduates to get better jobs without acquiring any university degree,\" Shawky explains. He proudly shared that he was one of the top 10 students in East Africa and among the best in the world, when the results were announced in 2006. </p><p>The first 53 students, 8 of whom were girls, entered Sheikh School based on the high marks they scored in the national examination. They were also selected from the top 100 bright students who hailed from all over the Horn.  </p><p>Rasala Abdikadir, one of the 8 girls who graduated years ago said, \"Sheikh School is the only boarding institution in the country that provides separate accommodation for both genders.\" She declared that the cultural biases have created a huge gap between boys and girls, but \"girls naturally posses a talent and unquestionably can get to where boys have reached and even be in higher ranks,\" she explained in eloquent English. Today, Sheikh School is housing 38 girls, despite the limited female designated buildings. </p><p>Ever since revitalising, the school has helped in producing visionaries. These graduates have the know-how factor and are able to venture into the world without the fear of failure. </p><p>Thousands of miles away from London, Khaled Abdulsalam, 24, was pleased to revel his success and reminisce the good old days in Sheikh School.  He currently lives in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he is studying Construction Technology, but he also established his own business with three other friends, two of which are female graduate from Sheikh School. \"I found the largest Somali network marketing group and we now own two franchises.  We sell health products like herbal cosmetics, food supplements and health appliance from Tiens Biotech Group in Nairobi, Kenya.\" Khaled's business supports almost 30 independent distributors across Somaliland. He believes that they are supporting the health of many families, who don't have access to adequate healthcare system. </p><p>When asked whether his business is supporting Somaliland's economic development, he firmly said: \"We are helping Somaliland youth by providing a chance to establish their own business. This will unleash their entrepreneurship potential, especially leadership skills, which the economy of Somaliland is limping for so far.\" He plans to come back to his homeland, join the construction industry and one day launch his own company.</p><p>Khaled is not the only one who cannot wait to come back. Mohammed Bakal, ex-graduate, is presently in Egypt, studying for his second degree in agriculture and majoring in community development. \"I'm interested in development sector as we need more work to do in this filed, especially in the rural areas where more than half of our population reside,\" said Bakal, mindfully. </p><p>Students in Sheikh School never used to worry about funding their studies if they were unable to pay. SOS Children's Village funded almost 90 percent of the fees, while parents were encouraged to contribute the remaining 10 percent. Adam Muse, Sheikh School headmaster, revealed that this no longer the case. The current economic crisis in the West is limiting contributions from private donors. \"Despite the track-record and the equal opportunities we provide for both genders, many local international charities are not interested in funding secondary education,\" said Muse disappointedly. He added: \"Even food donation is not something they are willing to fund, as they rather focus on primary education projects.\" </p><p>To reaffirm the reasons he succeeded, Abdulsalam rightfully said: \"Somaliland is the best place for young people who have big dreams with good education [as key factor] because life changing opportunities are so copious and the country is still growing.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/07/eton-college-somaliland","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/07/eton-college-somaliland","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"Emerging economies lead the way for sustainable innovation","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-10T10:13:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/emerging-economies-lead-sustainable-innovation","fields":{"body":"<p>For decades, sustainability has been seen as an unnecessary add-on for businesses and incompatible as a core part of business development.</p><p>Yes, there have been some very high profile failures, but there are many examples out there that prove this belief wrong. Today sees the launch of a <a href=\"http://sustainia.me/resources/publications/2nd_sustainia100_2013.pdf\" title=\"\">sustainability guide</a> that maps cleantech innovations in 128 countries around the world. This guide documents how the deployment of sustainable innovation is picking up pace, not only in traditional Western hubs, but also within emerging markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The guide reveals tangible examples of sustainable innovations that are readily available, increasing in scale and showcasing financial viability across different sectors. It is these types of solutions that demonstrate the ability to transform industries and meet consumers' growing desire for sustainable products and services. What we must start communicating is how so many of today's sustainable innovations are having a positive financial impact on businesses and the consumers' bottom-line.</p><p>The British start-up <a href=\"http://www.azuri-technologies.com/\" title=\"\">Azuri</a>, is one such example, producing low-cost solar panel solutions for off-grid areas in rural Africa. A tangible solution that is bringing clean energy to markets, where once kerosene was the only option. Beyond providing clean energy, this smart rent-to-own system, makes solar technology affordable at half the price of kerosene.&nbsp;This grants access to longer lasting renewable energy source without having to travel hours to get the kerosene. It also takes away the problem of kerosene fumes in homes, improving health.</p><p>As a key milestone for Azuri's business model, the first round of households have paid off the solar panels moving from renting to owning. Simply put, this is transforming the lives of off-grid rural citizens making them owners of cutting-edge technology and building a healthier safer home environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A surprising finding is that among the 1,000 plus researched projects and technologies, emerging economies show high rates of deployment as conventional infrastructure is simply unrealistic. Out of the identified 100 global sustainable solutions, Asia deploys 43, sub-Saharan Africa 23, while Kenya alone deploys 10 solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Zooming in on sub-Saharan Africa, it is both internet and mobile technologies that are revolutionising rural areas and helping to build local markets. In other words, emerging economies are potentially leapfrogging their own industrial revolution by deploying state-of-the-art transformational technologies, adapting solutions to a local context of specific challenges directly to the end-consumer.&nbsp;</p><p>Cell phones have proven a valuable asset in Africa. In Zambia, a low-cost, low-tech yet high-impact approach to cervical cancer prevention uses digital cell phone based photography as a diagnostic tool. Immediate online consultation and peer-reviews are carried out based on photographs, serving both screening and treatment. &nbsp;</p><p>Cell phone technology in Tanzania provides a solution to address poor tracking of healthcare supplies, reducing deaths from curable diseases such as malaria. Stock requests are sent once a week via SMS to over 5,000 registered health facilities in Tanzania, which are able to send SMS information back for free. This redistributes supplies between locations preventing facilities from running out.&nbsp;</p><p>Other emerging economies such as Brazil, India, South Africa and Mexico are actively contributing to transformational developments. More than just adopting Western innovations these countries are developing their own solutions on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The developments we are witnessing could very well be the first step of a revolution in which emerging economies present themselves as successful innovators in their own right as they understand and live the need for sustainable innovation.</p><p>Sustainable projects and technologies will increasingly work as a vehicle to address local challenges and drive local markets. The traditional flow of inspiration and innovation through to tangible solutions will break with convention, and emerging economies will become new hubs of innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Christopher Sveen is director of business development for <a href=\"http://www.sustainia.me/\">Sustainia</a>.

Not only did this fantastically furry beast <a href=\"https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/1640/1644\">go extinct some 4,000 years ago</a>, but now increasing numbers of influential people are saying that we should not try to bring it – and other extinct species – back to life, as scientists and an assortment of tech-savvy dreamers <a href=\"http://tedxdeextinction.org/\">have recently proposed to do</a>.</p><p>I'm talking about resurrection biology, aka <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/125-species-revival/zimmer-text\">de-extinction</a>, the idea that scientists could use new genetic technologies like cloning to resurrect extinct animals using DNA extracted from museum specimens, frozen tissue samples or even (in the case of the mammoth) from carcasses preserved under the Arctic tundra.</p><p>The latest censure of resurrection biology comes from the usually sober Scientific American. Last week's <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-efforts-bring-extinct-species-back-from-dead-miss-point\">editorial</a> argues that \"with limited intellectual bandwidth and financial resources to go around, de-extinction threatens to divert attention from the modern biodiversity crisis.\" The IUCN <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/news/more-highlights-from-the-latest-iucn-rl-update\">Red List</a> categorises more than 20,000 species as threatened with extinction, Sci Am reminds us, and with a looming mass extinction of this size, \"conservationists face difficult choices about which species and ecosystems to try to save, since they cannot hope to rescue them all.\" </p><p>\"Against this backdrop, a costly and flamboyant project to resuscitate extinct flora and fauna in the name of conservation looks irresponsible: Should we resurrect the mammoth only to let elephants go under? Of course not.\" </p><p>The editors warn that \"the revival of a single extinct beast in a lab does not mark the return of a species, and creating viable populations of extinct animals that could flourish in modern ecosystems is a far more difficult challenge\", although they do concede that the de-extinction enterprise is not completely without merit. Its technologies, they say, could be used to help endangered species that have lost much of their genetic diversity \"such as the <a href=\"http://www.blackfootedferret.org/\">black-footed ferret</a> and the northern white rhino. Such investigations, however, should be conducted under the mantle of preserving modern biodiversity rather than conjuring extinct species from the grave.\"</p><p>In short, their argument is that de-extinction is too expensive and we should spend our brainpower and cash on extant species, not extinct ones. (And not be flamboyant if we can help it.)</p><p>I found it interesting that Scientific American mentioned the northern white rhinoceros, perhaps better called by an earlier name, <a href=\"http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/species/nile-rhino/\">Nile rhinoceros</a>. It's ridiculously close to being extinct. In 1960 there were probably <a href=\"www.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/1999-049.pdf‎\">over 2,000</a> in northeast Africa. Today, thanks to relentless poaching and weak conservation efforts, there are none known to be left in the wild and a mere seven in captivity, of which only four, two males and two females, are still young enough to breed. </p><p>The Nile rhino is hanging on by the very tip of its <a href=\"http://e360.yale.edu/feature/the_dirty_war_against_africas_remaining_rhinos/2595/\">insanely overpriced horn</a>. Some biologists would call it a '<a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/2327661/The_Time_of_Living_Dead_Species_Extinction_Debt_and_Futurity_in_Madagascar_Forthcoming_2013_\">zombie species</a>', not technically extinct but doomed to oblivion because of its tiny, inbred population.</p><p>The two females are mother and daughter, and the males are also close relatives. Only one, the older male, has ever known life in the wild; the other three were born in a <a href=\"http://www.zoodvurkralove.cz/en/\">Czech zoo</a>. All four breeding-age animals are now at <a href=\"http://www.olpejetaconservancy.org/\">Ol Pejeta Conservancy</a> in Kenya, where I visited them in 2011, and where conservationists are still trying to persuade them to reproduce.</p><p>Due to the last members of the species being adapted to zoo life, it might also have permanently lost memory of important natural behaviours, the things adult animals teach their young to help them to survive. It is certainly functionally extinct, i.e. no longer performing its role in the ecosystem. Large parts of the Nile rhino's <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/4185/0\">historic range</a> in northeast Congo and South Sudan are also bedeviled by rampant poaching and armed conflict.</p><p>In other words, the remnant micro-population of Nile rhino is rather like a beginning-stage population of de-extincted mammoths or another large mammal would be: missing important behaviours, likely with limited genetic diversity (because they'd have been derived from a small amount of genetic material) and most definitely functionally extinct, with its place in the ecosystem perhaps unsure due to changes that might have occurred in its absence.</p><p>I'm not sure why the Scientific American editors endorse new genetic technologies to build the Nile rhinoceros population but argue against using very similar technologies to bring back other species like the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vqCCI1ZF7o\">thylacine</a> and the <a href=\"http://passengerpigeon.org/\">passenger pigeon</a>, species that humans have pushed into extinction within the last century and which could have important roles to play in our ecosystems if brought back.</p><p>Most of us have been taught that there's an abrupt line between being extant and being extinct, whereas there is and always has been something of a continuum between the two states. Resurrection biology makes the continuum between species that are abundant, species that are extremely rare and species that have no living members more obvious than it has been in the past because there's now potential to reverse away from 'total' extinction back along the continuum to 'thriving'. This apparently makes many people, including some serious science editor types, irrationally uncomfortable.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-410336121'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/7/1370590689858/AdamWelz460pxGuardianBlog-20130528_FieldMuseumChicagoIL-6199.jpg' alt='Extinct North American birds: Ivory-billed Woodpecker, Carolina Parakeet, Passenger Pigeon' width='460' height='306' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Candidates for de-extinction: Three extinct North American birds (l to r) Ivory-billed Woodpecker, Carolina Parakeet, Passenger Pigeon, in the collection of the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago.</figcaption></figure><p>Many critics of resurrection biology like David Ehrenfeld, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/23/de-extinction-efforts-are-waste-of-time-money\">writing in The Guardian</a>, have homed in on its likely massive price tag and like Ehrenfeld, Scientific American presumes that the money for de-extinction has to come from conventional conservation's constrained cashbox.</p><p>Why so? Somewhat unscientifically, they give readers no evidence for their claim.</p><p>I think that resurrection biology efforts could quite realistically attract donors and investors who have never thought of being involved in wildlife conservation before, but are interested in the awesome novelty of bringing things back to life and the impressive (and perhaps impressively profitable) technology involved. They might even become interested in saving species the old-fashioned way, too.</p><p>I also think that expensive projects can be good. There's a strong case for spending enormous amounts of money to save species even when it's tough because expensive, long, difficult conservation projects tend to build strong institutions staffed by skilled, dedicated people who see their missions through. The trick is to pick species whose conservation will benefit large numbers of other species and help bring damaged ecosystems back to health.</p><p>Consider the <a href=\"http://www.peregrinefund.org/projects/california-condor\">California condor</a>: This massive scavenging bird was extinct in the wild in the late 1980s, with a tiny population left in captivity. Over many years and at a cost of <a href=\"http://www.hawkwatch.org/about-raptors/species-fact-sheets/366-california-condor\">over $35 million</a>, a few hundred have been bred and released into California, Arizona and Mexico. They live heavily monitored and subsidized lives, each bird carrying tracking devices and many receiving supplementary food from conservationists. Each year every free-flying condor is captured and tested for lead in their blood, because many condors die after ingesting poisonous lead bullet fragments that are left in hunter-killed deer carcasses.</p><p>Is the project a failure? After all, a lot of money has been spent to create 'wild' condors that must be constantly and very expensively attended-to.</p><p>Maybe not. Putting California condors back in the wild has put a spotlight on lead poisoning, which affects dozens of other species. <a href=\"https://www.peregrinefund.org/subsites/conference-lead/PDF/0309%20Sieg.pdf\">Voluntary lead reduction efforts</a> are underway in Arizona, and the state of California <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/political/la-me-pc-california-assembly-lead-ammunition-20130516,0,6492322.story\">might ban lead bullets soon</a>, thanks to the dedicated efforts of people who have spent so much time and money getting the condor back from the brink that they're unlikely to stop until the job is done, with considerable benefit to wildlife and human health.</p><p>Scientific American's editors also object to resurrection biology on the basis that \"a program to restore extinct species poses a risk of selling the public on a false promise that technology alone can solve our ongoing environmental woes—an implicit assurance that if a species goes away, we can snap our fingers and bring it back.\"</p><p>This is a sobering thought that deserves careful consideration, but evidence suggests the reverse could be true; the potential to resurrect species could inspire conservation efforts.</p><p>When ornithologists said in 2005 that they'd rediscovered the extinct ivory-billed woodpecker in Arkansas, the notoriously anti-environmental government of George W. Bush eagerly committed more than <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/magazine/07woodpecker.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">$10 million</a> to study and conserve it, The Nature Conservancy said they'd buy an <a href=\"http://www.arkansasleader.com/2005/05/from-publisher-group-to-buy-200000.html\">extra 200,000 acres of its swampy forest habitat</a> and protect it and the news made headlines around the world – a huge boost for conservation, even though the continued existence of the ivory-bill is now in doubt.</p><p>If scientists bring back long-extinct, charismatic species, does anyone seriously think that politicians would stand in the way of allowing them to thrive? People are strongly drawn to miraculous stories of resurrection (Jesus of Nazareth has more than a few fans) and de-extinction could, if framed and conducted correctly, bring new awareness to extinction and habitat protection. </p><p>Perhaps the strongest argument for resurrection biology is that it allows wildlife conservationists to push forward against the onslaught of extinction, in some sense to win back territory that has been lost, to engage in restoration, rejuvenation and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/27/my-manifesto-rewilding-world\">rewilding</a>. </p><p>How long can an army remain motivated if it's never allowed to advance, if it's only allowed to hold the line or, step by painful step, retreat?</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/11/19/canada140x84.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/nature-up/2013/jun/07/deextinction-critics-scientific-american","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/nature-up/2013/jun/07/deextinction-critics-scientific-american","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Ed Miliband's speech on welfare: Politics live blog","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-06T14:55:00Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/blog/2013/jun/06/ed-miliband-welfare-live-blog","fields":{"body":"<div id=\"block-51b0a2e3e4b0cc64243720be\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-06T15:55:31.725+01:00\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>• George Osborne has accused Labour of hypocrisy over tax avoidance.</strong> Commenting on the revelation that a Labour donor gave a donation to the party in the form of shares to minimise his tax liability, Osborne said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think Ed Miliband is practising the complete opposite of what he preaches.

The idea that welfare is on an unsustainable upward trend is at best a folk memory from the postwar decades, with zero relevance to current circumstances ...</p> <p>But the cap is more about sending a signal on future spending intentions than upgrading the armoury of fiscal discipline. Policy wonks might be well advised not to probe to deeply into the detail of a policy which is essentially symbolic in intent. Whatever fiscal stance Labour adopted were it to form the next government, the idea that it would not have to make further reductions in spending is implausible. Better to get that message across now, both to the public and the party faithful.</p> <p>And as a communication device, the cap really can’t be faulted.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/maryriddell/100220617/100220617/?utm_source=feedly\">• Mary Riddell at the Telegraph says life under a Labour government would be grim.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Be very afraid.

On the contrary, Mr Miliband has been honest to a fault.</p> <p>No one reading his welfare speech, billed as one of the defining moments of opposition, can be under any illusion as to how tough an incoming Labour government would be.

Because, thanks to our ageing nation, the state pension liability is growing year-on-year, and even pushing back the pension age by a year from 2026 won’t help too much. Of course, it would be possible for Labour to define that increase as something other than structural – “demographic”, perhaps – and thereby dodge the question. But if they don’t, the key effect of this promise could be that Labour has pledged to cut pensions, two years before a general election against a party which has pledged to keep them above inflation and wage rises indefinitely.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/06/miliband-has-given-labour-welfare-message-it-can-sell?utm_source=feedly\">• George Eaton at the Staggers says Labour is now “in a far stronger position on welfare than before” as a result of the speech.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timwigmore/100220520/rip-universalism-now-only-ukip-supports-it/?utm_source=feedly\">• Tim Wigmore at the Telegraph says Ukip is now the only party firmly committed to universality in the welfare system.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/leftwatch/2013/06/by-mark-wallacefollowmarkon-twitter-ed-milibands-about-turn-on-welfare-spending-is-a-sign-of-how-politically-effective-the.html\">• Mark Wallace at ConservativeHome has six questions for Labour about Miliband’s proposals.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51b0952be4b0bfa7376c46c1\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-06T14:57:00.156+01:00\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here&apos;s the Guardian video of an excerpt from Ed Miliband&apos;s speech.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2013/jun/06/ed-miliband-labour-welfare-video\"                                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                                data-video-name=\"Ed Miliband promises Labour welfare cap - video\"                                > <iframe src=\"http://gu-embedded-video.appspot.com/?u=/politics/video/2013/jun/06/ed-miliband-labour-welfare-video\" overflow:hidden scrolling=\"no\" width=\"460\" height=\"397\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51b07a0de4b02447594f4410\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-06T14:20:37.831+01:00\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>• Ed Miliband has sought to quash Tory claims that his party is soft on welfare with a landmark speech committing Labour to an overall benefits spending cap and significant welfare reform.</strong> He said that Labour would set a three-year limit on &quot;structural social security spending&quot; (ie spending not affected by the economic cycle and possible rising unemployment) and that it would introduce a greater contributory element into jobseeker&apos;s allowance. He was speaking three days after Ed Balls signalled Labour would broadly accept coalition spending cuts and the two speeches amount to a major repositioning. Significantly Miliband&apos;s speech has been warmly applauded both by Blairites on the right of the party and by Unite, the leftish union which is the party&apos;s biggest financial backer. The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, who reacted angrily when Labour last committed itself to accepting coalition cuts in January last year, was particularly impressed by Miliband&apos;s focus on workplace pay and conditions and by Miliband&apos;s admission that &quot;for too many people in Britain the workplace is nasty, brutish and unfair&quot;. Miliband did not give any details about how the overall welfare cap would work and, beyond saying that his cost-neutral plan to improve contributory jobseeker&apos;s allowance would result in some claimants receiving less, none of his proposals were particularly punitive. The only obvious losers would be landlords charging high levels of housing benefit (because Miliband wants to make it easier for councils to negotiate rents down). The Tories said that Labour had opposed welfare cuts in the past and they challenged Miliband to identify those cuts that he had voted against in the past that he was now willing to accept. Labour is ducking questions of this kind, although the Balls speech implies hardly any of the coalition&apos;s welfare cuts would be reversed under Labour. In one sense this marks a victory for David Cameron. But a key dividing line that Cameron and Lynton Crosby were hoping to deploy at the 2015 general election has just been blurred, if not eliminated entirely.</p> <p><strong>• William Hague, the foreign secretary, has announced that Britain will pay almost £20m in compensation and costs to 5,228 Kenyans who suffered torture and abuse at the hands of the British during the Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s.</strong> He made the announcement <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-to-parliament-on-settlement-of-mau-mau-claims\">in a statement to the Commons.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We understand the pain and the grief felt by those who were involved in the events of emergency in Kenya. The British Government recognises that Kenyans were subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment at the hands of the colonial administration.</p> <p>The British Government sincerely regrets that these abuses took place and that they marred Kenya&apos;s progress to independence. Torture and ill-treatment are abhorrent violations of human dignity which we unreservedly condemn.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• George Osborne, the chancellor, has challenged Labour to refund the Treasury for money lost through tax avoidance by a Labour donor.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jun/06/labour-party-backer-donation-tax\">John Mills, Labour&apos;s biggest individual donor, has admitted his donation was given to the party in the form of shares early this year in order to minimise the amount of tax he would have to pay, relative to the cost to him if he gave the money in the form of a donation.</a> &quot;Will you now pass the amount of tax that has been avoided to the Exchequer?&quot; Osborne said in a letter to Miliband. At a Q&amp;A after his speech<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22793181\"> Miliband said that Mills had given the party money in the form of shares to provide the party with a &quot;steady income&quot; and that the party would be paying tax on the income it received.</a></p> <p><strong>• Downing Street has said that there is &quot;complete agreement&quot; within cabinet on the government&apos;s approach to Syria.</strong> The prime minister&apos;s spokesman was responding to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2336720/Cabinet-split-plans-arm-Syrian-rebels-Cameron-pressure-claims-peace-talks-doomed-fail.html\">reports that the cabinet is split on this issue.</a> In a separate move, some 81 Conservative MPs have signed a letter to the prime minister demanding the Commons votes before any decision to send arms to opposition forces fighting the regime of president Bashar al-Assad in Syria.</p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jun/06/residents-get-more-say-wind-farm\">Ministers have announced that residents will be able to stop the construction of windfarms under tough rules that could seriously restrict the growth of onshore wind power generation</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>• David Cameron has announced plans today to deliver £250m of new funding to help communities buy and run local facilities such as shops, pubs, playing fields and swimming pools.</strong> As the Press Association reports, Cameron said the scheme was proof of his continuing passion for his &quot;Big Society&quot; agenda, following claims from critics that it had been quietly sidelined since the general election. Under the plans, the Big Society Capital bank and Big Lottery Fund will provide grants and loans through social investment funds to help communities keep open facilities, many of which face closure by councils or commercial companies. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-at-the-social-impact-investment-conference\">Speaking to a Social Impact Investment Forum staged in London as part of the UK&apos;s chairmanship of the G8,</a> Cameron also announced a consultation on new tax breaks for social enterprises.</p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jun/06/a-and-e-crisis-jeremy-hunt\">Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has sought to defuse the row over the crisis in A&amp;E by announcing a fundamental review of emergency care – conceding that &quot;we have failed to give the public confidence that there&apos;s anything between GP surgeries and A&amp;E</a>&quot;.</strong></p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/06/clegg-hits-back-tories-i-never-agreed-new-childcare-ratios\">Nick Clegg has said that it is &quot;flatly wrong&quot; to suggest that at one point he approved Elizabeth Truss&apos;s plan to relax childcare ratios</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jun/06/chinese-equipment-uk-phone-networks-huawei\">A group of MPs has lambasted the government for risking national security by failing to monitor the widespread use of Chinese equipment in Britain&apos;s phone and broadband networks</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6738\">The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published an analysis showing that children and pensioners were the main beneficiaries of Labour&apos;s anti-poverty programmes</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>• The Conservative MP Richard Drax has spoken of his family&apos;s relief after their lesbian housekeeper had her case for sexual harassment and unfair dismissal unanimously thrown out.</strong> As the Press Association reports, Drax, MP for South Dorset, wept as the decision of an employment tribunal was reached yesterday and said afterwards that the claims had been &quot;extremely stressful&quot; for his family.

What we’ve got is the Labour party worried about their image on welfare, they’ve become the welfare party, they’ve voted against £80bn of our savings in welfare and now we get finally a vacuous message saying they’re kind of in favour of an overall limit but they don’t tell us what they would cut.</p> <p>They say that they’re for reform but they’ve got to tell us: Will you reverse the cap?

They are thoroughly fed up with the lack of decent, secure work in this country and detest the waste of talent that sees one million young people wasting their talents on the dole.</p> <p>So the jobs guarantee, action on demeaning, insecure work and a drive to embed the living wage are a good start. Labour now needs to firm these up, working with unions, as well as employers, because with our connection to millions of working people we can bring these promises to life, and address some of the real drains on people&apos;s incomes such as childcare and travel costs.</p> <p>Ed Miliband is also right to recognise that decade upon decade of housing neglect has saddled this country with a chronic homelessness problem and a warped social security bill.</p> <p>This is now about offering a distinctive choice in 2015 about the sort of nation we can be. If Ed Miliband continues in this vein, then he will win working people back to Labour.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/?p=1069&amp;option=com_wordpress&amp;Itemid=17\">From <strong>Nick Pearce</strong>, director of the IPPR thinktank.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the foreseeable future, then, the welfare state and the broader architecture of collective public provision will contain elements of universalism, means-testing and contribution. The majoritarian character of Labour’s agenda today is affirmed by its recognition that social security should not be reduced solely to its means-tested elements, nor focused on particularly disadvantaged claimants groups, rather than the broad mass of the population. This remains the key dividing line between Labour’s approach and that of work and pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (at least for working-age benefits, since both parties support the principle of a single-tier basic state pension).</p> <p>Labour’s majoritarianism takes on a new shape in Miliband’s speech, however. Three key areas stand out. First, there is the attempt to resuscitate the contributory principle, via changes to the rules for jobseeker’s allowance payments. Second, there is an argument that wages, the rewards to work and the employment rate must all rise as a core component of any welfare strategy, to take the strain off tax credits. (Although it should be noted that almost all OECD countries operate tax credit or in-work benefit systems, and there will always be an important role for these transfers, even if real wages and household employment can rise.) Third, there is a marked shift towards productive investment in institutions and services, rather than compensatory transfers: from housing benefit back to bricks and mortar, and from child benefits and tax credits to childcare services.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Mark Serwotka</strong>, the PCS union general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour urgently needs to offer a clear alternative to Tory despair, one that will inspire people and repair the serious damage being done to our communities and our economy by this government.</p> <p>We do desperately need investment in housing, jobs and our economy, but Labour continues to set this in the context of austerity, parroting the Tories&apos; divisive striver versus skivers rhetoric, and it is exactly these policies that are failing.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Duncan O’Leary</strong>, deputy director of thinktank Demos</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The British public have fallen out of love with the welfare state, so any move towards rewarding contribution is welcome. People need to see a stronger relationship between what they put in and can take out of the system.</p> <p>The question is how to create a meaningful two tier system - and how to pay for it.</p> <p>Demos has shown how the government could afford nearly £25 extra a week in job seeker’s allowance for contributors, by saving over £250m on benefits that go to homeowners. This is the sort of ‘something for something’ approach that will restore people’s faith in welfare.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100220554/ed-miliband-labour-moderniser/\">From the Telegraph&apos;s <strong>Dan Hodges</strong></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, Ed Miliband became a moderniser. He will hate that tag, given its association with New Labour, Blairism and all that ritual sacrifice of the working class stuff. But a moderniser is what he now is.</p> <p>In the space of four days we’ve had more major policy announcements than in the entire two-and-half years of Miliband’s leadership. Not a Clause 4 moment, but a Clause 4 week.</p> <p>The speed and scale of Miliband’s shift of stance is staggering. In December he was pledging in the Observer to “wage war on George Osborne on benefit cuts”. This morning, he announced that Labour would be introducing its own benefits cap, would be sticking to Tory benefit levels for 2015/2016, would be limiting access to benefits by introducing a contributory principle and stated bluntly that when it came to fiscal restraint, “Social security spending, vital as it is, cannot be exempt from that discipline”.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Matthew Sinclair</strong>, chief executive of the TaxPayers&apos; Alliance</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ed Miliband is right to acknowledge the burden of our enormous welfare budget but his proposals won&apos;t do anything to tackle it. The best way to bring down the welfare bill is to focus on the cost of individual benefits, not introduce an overall spending cap. It&apos;s also crucial that work pays, which means cutting taxes and leaving more money in the pockets of the people who earned it. Continuing to trap people in a complex welfare system just isn&apos;t acceptable, so politicians must get serious about simplifying benefits, cutting taxes and removing regulations.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/solidarity-not-scroungers/\">From the Fabian Society&apos;s <strong>Natan Doron</strong></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ed Miliband may have just pulled off the most unexpected trick of all: delivering a populist Labour stance on welfare. New research by the Fabian Society and the charity <em>Crisis</em> published today showed that there is overwhelming public support for a programme to tackle the root causes of housing benefit spending. Not only is this is a politics of welfare that Labour can win on, but it can do so by building a social security system that people feel works for everyone.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2013/06/ignore-the-media-spin-this-is-the-welfare-speech-ed-miliband-will-actually-give-today/\">From <strong>Mark Ferguson</strong> at LabourList</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the whole though, the proposals outlined by Miliband are positive. They focus on the genuine cost of welfare (both in terms of government spending and lost potential) rather than buying into the shameful “scrounger” rhetoric of the government. And it’s another clear nod from Ed Miliband that he realises, even in straightened times, that he’s going to have to make big changes to the British economy to right the structural wrongs that have left too many languishing in dole queues, stuck in poor quality and expensive housing and trapped in poverty (even if they’re in work).</p> <p><em><strong>Ignore the media spin.</strong></em> Ed Miliband is getting tough on welfare spending, but he isn’t getting tough on those who struggle to survive on welfare thanks to persistent government failure.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Alison Garnham</strong>, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We welcome the renewed commitment to child poverty reduction as a top priority for a future Labour administration. We always put our children’s needs first in family life, and we should do so as a nation too. Research published this week by Child Poverty Action Group shows that our high levels of child poverty cost Britain £29 billion a year, so it’s not just about doing the right thing for our children, it’s the right thing for our economy too.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c4642ac0-7c23-44ad-b5ea-830d8cb8a26b\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/6/1370519137874/2a320d46-8633-4f02-90d8-3bada66bad81-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Len McCluskey.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Len McCluskey.

(See<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2013/jun/06/ed-miliband-welfare-live-blog#block-51b04d27e4b029ed1cfbe7ad\"> 9.49am.)</a></p> <p>Experts, from the left and the right, have been arguing for some years now that it is time to restore the contributory principle in welfare. Here are some examples. It&apos;s a fairly heavyweight reading list, but it probably reflects what Miliband himself has been reading on his holidays.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/images/media/files/publication/2013/04/national-savings-insurance_July2011_7775.pdf\">• An Institute for Public Policy Research paper from 2011 proposing national salary insurance (pdf).</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over the last few decades, support for the welfare state has been undermined by a pincer movement of attacks. It has come to be seen both to reward people who do the wrong thing and to let down those who do the right thing. In short, it is thought to be not demanding enough of people who don’t work and not protective enough of those who do. <br />In response, successive governments have increased conditionality for those on benefits.</p> <p>This has strengthened the idea of mutual obligation, while also increasing people’s engagement with the world of work (improving their chances of finding a job). But these reforms have done nothing to address the concern that the welfare state does not provide real protection, when it is needed most, for people who have contributed into the system.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/images/publications/no_rights_w-o_responsibility.pdf\">• A Policy Exchange paper from 2011 called: No Rights Without Responsibility - Rebalancing the Welfare State (pdf).</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In order to re-establish a ‘something for something’ approach, a stronger link needs to be created between the National Insurance Contributions (NICs) individuals make and the beneﬁts they can receive if they fall on hard times. This could include stronger conditionality for those without a contribution record and higher beneﬁt levels for those who have contributed.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2012/05/contributory-benefits-and-social-security-policy\">• A Touchstone proposal on the contributory principle from 2012.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As Kate and Declan argue, the claims that we have a “something for nothing” welfare state are precisely wrong – part of the reason for the crisis in support for social security is the rise of the “nothing for something” system. A strategy for reviving support for decent benefits must tackle this. Workers will support a generous welfare state – but part of the deal must be a promise of security for all.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/files/1513/6973/2760/20130528_Chapter_3.pdf\">• A report from the SMF from May 2013 called Beveridge Rebooted (pdf).</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the core of any contributory welfare regime is the exclusion of people who have not paid in from the entitlements of those who have. As discussed above, it is a condition that the post-war social security systemconspicuously failed to achieve. The exclusion of non-contributors is essential to any stable insurance system. Without a solution to the so-called ‘free-rider’ problem, the system is highly vulnerable to exit from those who do contribute (in the case of voluntary insurance schemes) or political pressure to dismantle the system (in the case of compulsory national systems), of the kind we see today.</p> <p>Free-riders can be excluded by setting rules, such as having to have paid into the system for 12 or 24 months, before being entitled to contributory support. Indeed, as we have seen, the UK ostensibly operates a contributory system with a two-year qualifying period. But since contributory entitlement in the UK doesn’t exceed the means-tested benefit rate, it is far from obvious that those who have contributed are treated preferentially.</p> <p>In other systems that distinction is much clearer. In Germany’s compulsory insurance scheme, entitlement to Unemployment Benefit is conditional on a record of contributions to statutory unemployment insurance, and entitlements are more generous than for the means-tested social assistance scheme Unemployment Benefit II. Another model is the voluntary Danish Flexicurity system. In this system claimants must have a contribution record, but the cost of contributions is relatively high. This effectively prices out anyone in very low-paid, and hence more risky, employment. </p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/files/Something_For_Something_-_DuncanOLeary.pdf?1370259090\">• A report from Demos this week called Something for Something (pdf).</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Momentum has grown for a revival of the contributory principle – a key feature of William Beveridge’s vision or the welfare state which has faded away under successive governments.

In the Daily Telegraph yesterday <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/10098240/Can-Ed-Miliband-and-Ed-Balls-discover-a-touch-of-Clement-Attlees-steel.html\">Mary Riddell said the speech marked a &quot;victory&quot; for Byrne &quot;whose grasp of Labour’s welfare history is described as &apos;brilliant&apos; by a senior strategist&quot;.</a> Rafael Behr made a similar point <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/06/doubts-about-miliband%E2%80%99s-commitment-welfare-reform-go-flames-good-way-they-hope\">in a blog for the New Statesman. </a></p> <p>Byrne has been giving interviews about the speech this morning. Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>• Byrne identified two areas of welfare policy where the last Labour government was unsuccessful: incapacity benefit and the contributory principle.</strong> Labour should have &quot;moved faster&quot; on incapacity benefit reform, he said. And it &quot;should have done more to put ‘the something for something’ back in the social security system&quot;.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the really important arguments Ed [Miliband] is highlighting today is that a lot of people feel they’ve put a lot of money in and they don’t really get much back out when they need it. That’s especially true for working parents and it’s especially true for people in their 50s. We’re just beginning to float a few ideas today about how those who put more in can get more out, particularly to help those retrain and get back into work and retrain for a different career if they lose their jobs. These are the principles that will guide Labour’s approach to long-term social security reform.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• He played down suggestions that Labour would introduce rent controls to bring down housing benefit costs.</strong> Asked if Labour would do this, he replied: &quot;I think that may be going a bit far.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• He appeared to confirm that Labour would not reverse the cut in child benefit for people earning more than £50,000.</strong> &quot;We cannot make any changes that are not fully funded,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a couple of billion quid. That is a large amount of money. There will be a big queue of things that we want to get done.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• He said that when Labour was in office the amount spent on out-of-work benefits fell by £7.5bn.</strong></p> <p>I&apos;ve taken the quotes from<a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\"> PoliticsHome.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-06T14:06:46.991+01:00\">at 2.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51b047f5e4b0ae18e994b09a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-06T09:27:34.027+01:00\">9.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Cameron has been giving a speech this morning.

Bush visited three constituencies that Labour has to win if it wants to gain a majority in 2015.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While there is a good feeling on the ground, there is something in the air that people do not like about Labour.

Her accuser is wrong: she works a zero-hours contract in one of the local shops, and her concerns and Christine’s are incredibly similar: the cost of heating, the kids outgrowing their clothes, childcare ...</p> <p>The reason why the Tories want to talk about benefits is that it very quickly becomes an inescapable trap for Labour; we cannot win if people in Ilford, Reading and Norwich think that we will get into government and ‘waste’ their money on welfare, but if we are not in government, we cannot prove that we will not do so.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51b043aee4b029ed1cfbe7a5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-06T09:09:18.893+01:00\">9.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Cameron would like to fight the next election on three key issues: the economy, arguing that Labour would not control spending; immigration, arguing that only the Tories can bring it down; and welfare, arguing that Labour would squander money on “skivers”. One of Ed Miliband’s largest tasks has been to disable these lines of attack by repositioning Labour on all three issues.</p> <p>On immigration, Miliband has been stressing that the last Labour government made mistakes ever since his election. But on spending and on welfare he has, until now, been on the defensive. This week is being seen as absolutely crucial in Labour circles because, on these two battleground topics, Miliband is trying to pick his party up and put it back down in a different place. It happened with spending with<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2013/jun/03/ed-balls-lobbying-scandal-reaction-live?commentpage=1#block-51ac633ae4b00a6ab14f1d04\"> Ed Balls’ speech on Monday.</a> And today Miliband himself will attempt the welfare makeover with a speech in East London.</p> <p>It’s a big moment and I’ll be covering the speech, and the reaction to it, in detail.</p> <p>Labour has already released extracts from the speech in advance. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jun/06/labour-welfare-spending-high-rents\">Here’s Patrick Wintour’s story from today’s Guardian about what Miliband will say.</a></p> <p>And we’ve already got two analysis articles about the speech. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jun/05/ed-miliband-welfare-policy-labour-party\">Here’s one from Patrick,</a> and here’s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Nick Pearce, the IPPR director] set the Labour leader the challenge of changing the debate on welfare from “more versus less” to “better and different”. The next few months will show if the Miliband package has done enough.</p> </blockquote> <p>And<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/06/welfare-speech-ed-miliband-credible-alternative\"> here’s one from Martin Kettle,</a> and here’s an extract</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Will this speech turn things around for Miliband? That’s a big ask. Speeches don’t make the political weather, as he found when he made a well-regarded conference speech on the one-nation theme that had little effect on the ratings. Like that speech, though, Thursday’s appears to be a coherent one; while unlike the conference speech, it proposes real consequences for real people.</p> <p>The most positive thing about Miliband’s speeches is that he says what he means and means what he says. He genuinely believes that a mildly social democratic alternative is electable, even in times that are likely to be difficult for several years after 2015. That is what he is determined to offer. It remains to be seen if the voters like it. A very large number are going to have to rethink their view of Miliband for that to happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>As Patrick and Martin both argue, it is going to take a while before we know whether or not the speech has “worked”. But by the end of today we might be in a better position to judge what effect the speech will have.</p> <p>I’ll be focusing on the Miliband speech, but there are other stories around today.

We need to embark on massive training.\"</p><p></p><p>As Microsoft's East looked on, <a href=\"http://donaldclarkplanb.blogspot.com\" title=\"\">Donald Clark</a>, a British tech investor who worked in e-learning for 30 years, warned the audience: \"Be very careful of people who want to sell you tablets. There have been some disaster stories in the UK with tablets going out of the classroom.\"</p><p></p><p>Research shows that typing on a tablet is 20-30% less efficient than on a keyboard, he argued, and \"kids end up writing in shorter sentences\". In a separate seminar he described tablets as \"teacher unfriendly\", offering no feel for keys, slow text editing, and difficulties in networking.</p><p></p><p>\"We must be careful in terms of thinking all of this is good,\" Clark said. \"There is research that the tablet manufacturers don't want you to read that suggests they inhibit literacy. The keyboard is very important in terms of developing literacy.\"</p><p></p><p>In the closing debate of the conference, he took swipes at education tech gurus such as <a href=\"http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com\" title=\"\">Sugata Mitra</a> and <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/506466/given-tablets-but-no-teachers-ethiopian-children-teach-themselves\" title=\"\">Nicholas Negroponte</a> and urged: \"Don't let educational colonialism sneak in through the backdoor with bucket loads of hardware and content that is inappropriate for your children.\"</p><p></p><p>A recurring theme was past mistakes in which corporations have thrown technology at grateful African countries like a blunt instrument, offering little training, backup, or reference to a wider ecosystem. The continent has become a graveyard of abandoned laptops and good intentions.</p><p></p><p>Another tech giant, Samsung, displayed one of its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/oct/28/solar-powered-internet-school-children-africa\" title=\"\">mobile classrooms</a>, donating it to the host nation. Its corporate citizenship manager, Kea' Modimoeng, admitted: \"As companies we came to your countries and dumped laptops and we've run away. That's not sustainability. There needs to be collaboration. We are avoiding that situation by coming up with schemes that allow us to monitor implementation.\"</p><p></p><p>A smaller California-based company, <a href=\"http://www.ncomputing.com\" title=\"\">NComputing</a>, was promoting small black boxes that, fitted on the back of computer monitors, enable one PC to be shared by 100 users. The company claims the devices operate at a third of the cost of a PC, can save 90% on energy, and are less vulnerable to dirt, dust and theft while also reducing e-waste.</p><p></p><p>\"There's been a lot of technology dumped in Africa and it's not always useful technology,\" said vice-president Mark Pilgrim. \"The NGOs could spend their money more effectively.\"</p><p></p><p>There were also calls for more educational content to be delivered in indigenous African languages, since the dominance of English in the tech world can be an extra barrier. Professor Kwesi Kwaa Prah, director of the <a href=\"http://www.casas.co.za\" title=\"\">Centre for Advanced Studies of African Society</a>, told delegates: \"No society on Earth progresses on the basis of someone else's language. No society progresses on the basis of a language only spoken by 10% of the population.\"</p><p></p><p>He drew a contrast with Asian countries, which have prospered while retaining their own languages. \"If you want to make your profits,\" he told tech companies, \"you have to work in depth with the people, not just counting numbers of mobile phones.\"</p><p></p><p>Other projects mentioned involved delivering computers to embattled rural schools in Zimbabwe while training more than 800 headteachers, bringing maths and Arabic computer games to Sudan's 3 million children outside school, and using online video to preserve <a href=\"http://satuhaire.wordpress.com\" title=\"\">endangered African oral literature</a>. The biggest buzzword, however, was Moocs: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/12/moocs-scourge-saviour-higher-education\" title=\"\">massive open online courses</a>, described as \"the latest craze in Africa\".</p><p></p><p>A survey of e-learning practitioners in Africa found that 83% use laptops daily to support learning, followed by mobile phones (71%), standalone PCs (67%), TVs (34%) and radios (31%). Tablets were down the list on 20%. Nearly half the respondents admitted they have experienced failure.</p><p></p><p>Shafika Isaacs, editor of the <a href=\"http://www.elearning-africa.com/media_library_publications_ela_report_2013.php\" title=\"\">report</a>, said: \"We've had abundant examples of failure. The vast majority pointed to infrastructural and technological shortcomings. In Rwanda, as part of the <a href=\"http://one.laptop.org\" title=\"\">One Laptop per Child project</a>, I went to a rural school that claimed to have electricity. But when we got there, we found it only had one plug. We were meant to charge 1,200 laptops from that one plug.\"</p><p></p><p>Much work and research still has to be done to win over politicians to the e-learning cause, she added. \"There is not yet a compelling case of the benefit of technology in education in an African context. There is anecdotal evidence. There is hype. There is PR.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/3/14/1363265769176/MDG--South-African-studen-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jun/03/africa-beware-tech-companies-gifts","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2013/jun/03/africa-beware-tech-companies-gifts","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"How can big data be used for social good?","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-30T11:49:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/how-can-big-data-social-good","fields":{"body":"<p>Big data is everywhere these days. As the tools for making sense of big data become widely – and more expertly – applied, and types of data available for analysis diversify, the possibility to use big data for social good increases.</p><p>The application of big data for social change represents a relatively new trend. In 1997, NASA researchers Michael Cox and David Ellsworth coined the term big data to refer to the challenge of processing and visualising vast amounts information generated by supercomputers.</p><p>Ten years later, in the early days of Web 2.0 and Google Maps, tech writers revitalised the term to describe the benefits of large dataset analysis for fields of science, medicine, technology and business. Evangelists, for example, at Wired magazine <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_intro#\" title=\"\">celebrated the \"Petabyte Age\"</a> in which statistical analysis could make sense of large-scale datasets and predict weather patterns, map outer space, understand bone decay, and predict airline ticket prices.</p><p>Today, the main hype around big data concerns tracking and targeting consumers.</p><p>A proliferation of diverse datasets – from cell phone histories to sensor data, and from public records to point-of-sale systems – makes it possible to draw insightful correlations with a greater degree of granularity. Business writers <a href=\"http://smartdatacollective.com/rob-boirun/125671/how-big-data-changing-whole-equationbusiness\" title=\"\">regularly discuss</a> ways in which big data will propel competition, monitor impacts in real time, pinpoint effective marketing techniques, create accurate customer profiles and ultimately turn higher profits.</p><p>While <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/business-it/is-big-data-all-its-cracked-up-to-be-20130513-2jh55.html\" title=\"\">some researchers</a> and writers <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/03/17/uber-data-darwinism-and-the-future-of-work/\" title=\"\">claim data analytics</a> will create a data bourgeoisie, a new crop of social entrepreneurs and activists see opportunities to improve the state of the world by making sense of the current-day data deluge. And while they may employ similar tools on the backend, their motivation stems from a desire to help alleviate some of the world's most pressing problems; poverty, disease, ecological harm, war and famine.</p><p>Practitioners in fields such as public health and humanitarian relief view big data as a critical driver of empirically based problem-solving.</p><p>Much of the innovation comes from public-private partnerships or from nonprofit companies. In 2007, <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a> formed as a way to map user-generated accounts of violence in post-election Kenya, and subsequently help spur donations to the region. Its Swift River platform was created to categorise and verify crisis reporting transmitted by ordinary individuals in a short period of time through a variety of means such as emails, text messages and social media. Since forming, Ushahidi has been facilitating eyewitness reporting and analysis of such reporting, from the Haiti earthquake to corruption  in Macedonia.</p><p>DataKind, formerly Data Without Borders, formed with the intention of pairing data scientists with civil society groups in a pro-bono capacity. They have recently organised \"data dives\" or workshops to assist groups such as the World Bank in identifying and analysing multiple datasets for the purpose of supporting good governance, transparency and fighting corruption. They and other collectives or <a href=\"http://developersforgood.org/\" title=\"\">non-profits similar to them</a> work both locally and globally to support a new generation of socially minded data scientists.</p><p>But for-profit companies are also getting involved in big data for social good.</p><p>DemystData, uses big data to link financial institutions to individuals typically excluded from financial systems. The Hong Kong-based company mines social media and other online sources to target the \"unbanked\", who might otherwise steer clear of financial markets. DemystData then uses this information to help financial institutions improve service delivery to underserved customers.</p><p>The push for socially minded data analytics also stems from the popularisation of tools for analysis, on the one hand, and the (digital) release of information affecting social problems, on the other. For example, IBM's data visualisation tool, Many Eyes, launched in 2008 and <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2008/05/emerging-graphic-tool-getspeople-talking/ar/1\" title=\"\">intended to serve</a> as a means for businesses to draw from user-generated insights and innovation. (Much of the subsequent application of Many Eyes has entailed publicly available versus proprietary data.)</p><p>Open government initiatives, also contribute to socially minded data analytics. In the U S, President Obama signed an executive order in his first term, calling on all federal agencies to standardise and publicise available datasets and make it easier to find and analyse government. The administration has since <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/03/29/big-data-bigdeal\" title=\"\">encouraged innovative use</a> of big government datasets.</p><p>As more actors use data analytics for social good and the diversity of data sources explodes, what counts as reliable data analytics becomes a critical challenge. For Lucy Bernholz, a visiting scholar at Stanford University's Centre on Philanthropy and Civil Society, data analytics for social change requires <a href=\"http://www.marketsforgood.org/661/\" title=\"\">unflappable standards,</a> which build on innovative thinking, a commitment to openness and a respect for the rights of personal privacy.</p><p>Some organisations are doing exactly that. <a href=\"http://www.mhealthalliance.org/\" title=\"\">mHealth Alliance</a> is a public health group that analyses data transmitted from patients' mobile phones in countries like Bangladesh and South Africa. It recently announced a public-private partnership to engage questions of privacy and security in the use of mobile technologies in healthcare. With issues of equality and empowerment on the line, this and other work will help define ethical uses of big data for social good.</p><p><em>Seeta Peña Gangadharan is senior research fellow at the <a href=\"http://oti.newamerica.net/\">New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute</a>.</em></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

A total score of 8.0 means a country is on track to meet all the targets in the index.</p><h2>Key findings from the 2013 index include:</h2><blockquote><p>• The Maldives has displaced Cambodia as the top-performing country, on track to meet all of the core MDG targets included in the index. Cambodia's score dropped from 8.0 last year to 7.0.</p><p>• Some African countries have seen particularly sharp increases in their overall scores – Rwanda, for example, has moved from three to six, and is now tied with China.</p><p>• Since 2010, 49 poor countries have improved their overall MDG scores, 17 have declined and 10 have stayed the same. This reflects \"a general trend of accelerated progress, albeit with remaining pockets of lagging performance\", says the report.</p><p>• Thirty countries in sub-Saharan Africa appear to have accelerated progress in the past three years. At the same time some countries with very large populations, such as Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, are failing in many areas and slowing regional progress.</p></blockquote><p>Leo said he designed the index to combat frustrating \"broad brush portrayals\" of MDG progress or lack thereof, with reports using regional aggregates and statements like \"sub-Saharan Africa is woefully off track\". This masks the achievements of individual countries, he says, whose stories need to be teased out to understand why some have seen greater gains than others – and identify where the greatest needs remain.</p><p>For a study that relies heavily on country-level data, ONE's report is strikingly upfront about information gaps and its methodology section is replete with caveats. \"Year-to-year volatility in country performance can be significant due to a variety of factors, such as data quality, budgetary cycles and exogenous shocks,\" it notes. \"The time lag for the reporting of 'current' data – in some cases several years, or even a decade – also limits the accuracy of the results.\"</p><p>\"Simply put, it is difficult to definitively discern whether year-to-year differences are driven by concrete performance changes, measurement error (e.g. data noise) or some combination of the two.\"</p><p>A high-level panel set up by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon will report this week on its vision for what should succeed the MDGs.</p><p>Leo says discussions around what should succeed the MDGs must hone in on the importance of increasing statistical capacity and getting baseline data. He hopes attention on a post-2015 development framework does not detract from efforts to meet current goals, however.</p><p>\"We're not done; we have two and a half years and that's a lot of time to focus all available firepower … to achieve the maximum result,\" he said. \"We're seeing tremendous progress – the trendlines are absolutely clear – so it would be really a missed opportunity if all the attention shifted.\"</p><p>We've pulled out the total MDG progress index scores for countries covered in this year's edition.

change?","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-29T11:29:06Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/business-solve-worlds-problems-disruptive-change","fields":{"body":"<p>In our current state of economic distress, the last thing you'd expect is for business to start solving problems for people who are not their customers.</p><p>And yet, this is what Harvard business guru, <a href=\"http://www.claytonchristensen.com\" title=\"\">Clayton Christensen</a>, has been talking about since the mid-90s. There are two ways to disrupt markets – one, low-end disruption, occurs when a product or service starts as a simple application at the bottom of a market and then moves up market, eventually disrupting the leading competitors. The second, which business has not paid enough attention to, is new market disruption which occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry. What bigger market is there than the poor? And why are they not being served?</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/chart/estimated-bop-market-sector-5-trillion\" title=\"\">not-so recent estimate</a> puts the size of the market at $5tn with 4 billion potential customers, but the reasons why the poor are not viewed as customers is not so clear. According to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Scale-Development-Solutions-Millions/dp/0815724195/\" title=\"\">the research</a>, the top reasons businesses cite for not serving those at the base of the pyramid are as follows:</p><p>• Business model adjustments</p><p>• Business environment</p><p>• Operational partnerships</p><p>• Market or supplier development</p><p>• Funding partnerships</p><p>To me there is another reason: the mindset of the company leadership. Too often senior executives focus on their most profitable customers, and ignore emerging markets because they are simply not viewed as big enough, or profitable enough, to make a difference. Instead, they focus on 10% of the market because it is profitable, ignoring the other 90% which is assumed to be unreachable or unservable.</p><h2>Solving real problems at the right price</h2><p>When will companies start designing products and services for the <a href=\"http://www.cooperhewitt.org/tags/design-other-90\" title=\"\">other 90%</a>?</p><p>There's a growing movement lead by entrepreneurs such as Paul Polak who don't view the poor as a social responsibility or charity. Instead, the needs of the poor are viewed as a business opportunity. For example, Polak explains that while solar pumping systems have been available for years, they haven't been adopted at scale for one simple reason: they cost too much. The purchase price of solar PV systems is too high to be competitive with diesel pumps, even though the fuel and repair costs of diesel pumps are astronomical. By cutting the cost of solar pumping systems by 80%, Polak's <a href=\"http://blog.paulpolak.com/?p=1665\" title=\"\">Sunwater project</a> is seeking to boost small farmer incomes, create tens of thousands of new jobs, and significantly lower carbon emissions. He calls his design approach <a href=\"http://blog.paulpolak.com/?p=1669\" title=\"\">zerobased design</a>, an approach that starts from scratch, making no assumptions about the technology and strategy that can best be used or created to address a specific problem.</p><p>A few innovators engage the poor not just as consumers, but as producers, distributors, and retailers in their business models and value chains.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/publications/report_51_Project%20Nurture.pdf\" title=\"\">Project Nurture</a> is a $11.5m dollar partnership among The Coca-Cola Company, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the international non-profit organisation, TechnoServe. In essence, the three organisations are working together to build and strengthen the local ecosystem of mango and passion fruit producers and processors.</p><p>The goal is to double the fruit incomes of more than 50,000 smallholder farmers in Kenya and Uganda. Over the span of the project, all the players will develop the capabilities and commercial incentives to continue doing business together even after the project ends.</p><h2>Technology serving human rights</h2><p>There is a growing understanding among policymakers that innovations in technology offer disruptive and transformative opportunities in the field of <a href=\"http://skollworldforum.org/2012/11/11/disruption-at-the-intersection-of-technology-and-human-rights/\" title=\"\">human rights</a>. From the role of the internet in the Arab Spring, to the drama of WikiLeaks, technology and access to information have raised political stakes like never before.</p><p><a href=\"http://ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a>, which means \"testimony\" in Swahili, was a website that was initially developed to map reports of violence in Kenya after the post-election fallout at the beginning of 2008. Since then, it has grown into an anti-corruption and transparency mapping engine for anyone, anytime, anywhere. But it's still about the people. In a blog post titled <a href=\"http://blog.ushahidi.com/2013/05/14/how-to-fight-corruption-with-online-tools/\" title=\"\">How to fight corruption with online tools</a>, Tarik Nesh Nash says:</p><p>\"Technology can empower citizens, raise awareness and pressure authorities. Yet, technology cannot fight corruption; it cannot change cultures, detect problems, propose solutions or amend laws. People can. As we are building online tools, we should remember their raison d'être: they should be part of a broader strategy of engagement and participation.\"</p><p>The idea that technology will solve everything is of course a false hope. Despite the enthusiasm of techgnostics across the world, the responsibility and burden for change lies with individuals and businesses that want to make a difference.</p><h2>Job creation: the ultimate function of business?</h2><p>There used to be a popular story that private enterprise could do something that governments weren't very good at: create jobs. Is that still true?</p><p>According to Clayton Christensen, the current focus across on <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/clay-christensen-our-obsession-with-efficiency-is-killing-innovation-2012-12\" title=\"\">efficiency</a> and cost-cutting is succeeding in destroying jobs for many and creating capital for few: \"Disruptive innovations create jobs, whereas efficiency innovations destroy them.\"</p><p>Businesses must get back to creating long-term value. Christensen has suggested that we change the capital gains tax rate so that it decreases the longer an investment is held. That would encourage investment for the long run and encourage real innovation, as opposed to short-term measures designed to boost the next quarter's results.</p><p>Living-job creation is what <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/alanhall/2012/12/11/clayton-christensen-on-the-entrepreneurial-solutions-our-economy-needs/\" title=\"\">society requires most from business</a>.

In the week since a British soldier was horrifically stabbed to death by London jihadists on the streets of Woolwich, it's July 2005 all over again. David Cameron immediately rushed to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/may/26/david-cameron-anti-terror-task-force\" title=\"\">set up a task force</a> and vowed to ban \"hate clerics\". Now the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/may/26/theresa-may-measures-combat-terrorism\" title=\"\">home secretary wants to outlaw \"nonviolent extremist\" organisations, censor broadcasters and websites and revive plans to put the whole country's phone and web records under surveillance</a>.</p><p>\"Kneejerk\" barely does it justice. As for the impact on Muslims, the backlash has if anything been worse than in 2005, when 52 Londoners were killed by suicide bombers. As the police and a BBC reporter described the alleged killers as of \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/may/23/woolwich-attack-bbc-nick-robinson-muslim\" title=\"\">Muslim appearance</a>\" (in other words, non-white), Islamophobic attacks spiked across the country. In the first five days 10 mosques were attacked, culminating in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/may/27/grimsby-mosque-petrol-bombs\" title=\"\">triple petrol bombing in Grimsby</a>.</p><p>As politicians and the media congratulated themselves that Britain was \"calmly carrying on as usual\", it won't have felt like that to the Muslim woman who had her veil ripped off and was knocked unconscious in Bolton. Nor, presumably, to the family of 75-year-old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/may/02/birmingham-murder-racially-motivated-police\" title=\"\">Mohammed Saleem, stabbed to death in Birmingham</a> in what had all the hallmarks of an Islamophobic attack last month – or, for that matter, the nearly two-thirds of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/may/25/woolwich-attack-islam\" title=\"\">population who think there will be a \"clash of civilisations</a>\" between white Britons and Muslims, up 9% since the Woolwich atrocity.</p><p>One key change since 2005 is the rise&nbsp;of the violently anti-Muslim English&nbsp;Defence League, given a new lease of life by Woolwich. More than 40% of Islamophobic incidents recorded&nbsp;by the Muslim organisation <a href=\"http://faith-matters.org/\" title=\"\">Faith Matters</a> last year were linked to the EDL or other far-right groups. \"It makes me feel I don't belong here\", one Muslim community leader quotes his teenage son as telling him this week.</p><p>But almost nobody in public life mentions the war. The reason cited by the alleged Woolwich killers – the role of British troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and the war on terror – has been mostly brushed aside as unseemly to discuss. Echoing his predecessors, the prime minister insisted the Woolwich killing was \"an attack on the British way of life\". London mayor Boris Johnson declared there could be \"no question\" of blaming British foreign policy or \"what British troops do in operations abroad\".</p><p>Instead, the problem is once again said to be \"Islamism\", regardless of the string of democratic Islamist governments elected from Turkey to Tunisia. Or the focus is on the \"mistakes\" of MI5, as if any amount of spooking could detect the determination of an enraged takfiri killer to exact revenge with kitchen knives and meat cleavers. Whatever the focus, even to mention the western wars that drive these attacks is deemed to justify them.</p><p>That is, of course, absurd. Targeting a soldier who fought in Afghanistan might not be terrorism in the sense of an indiscriminate attack on civilians. But the random butchery of an unarmed man far from the conflict by disconnected individuals who have nonviolent political alternatives is clearly unjustifiable in any significant religious or political tradition.</p><p>The fact that the US declared the war on terror to be a war without national borders and routinely targets unarmed or unidentified victims has fatally blurred those boundaries. The grisly, intimate killing of Lee&nbsp;Rigby was the absolute antithesis of high technology drone attacks. But both embody the degradation of the&nbsp;human spirit.</p><p>There can be no surprise, however, that such attacks take place. It's not just opponents of the war on terror who predicted from the start that it would fuel terrorism not fight it. The intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic did the same. The perpetrators of one attack after another, from London 2005 to Boston 2013, say they're carrying them out in retaliation for the vastly larger scale US and British killing in the Muslim world.</p><p>It's true that all kinds of personal factors and experiences help create the&nbsp;mentality to carry out such attacks. But as Abdul Haqq Baker – head of the south London \"counter-radicalisation\" outfit Street – puts it, the tipping point that has turned people to violence has been shown again and again to be episodes in the war on terror.</p><p>There is already some evidence that torture of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/woolwich-attack-terror-suspect-michael-adebolajo-was-arrested-in-kenya-on-suspicion-of-being-at-centre-of-alqaidainspired-plot-8632398.html\" title=\"\">one of the Woolwich suspects in Kenya</a> – after which MI5 tried to recruit him – may have been such a catalyst. Azad Ali, a Muslim community activist who has advised the Metropolitan police, says there has been a pattern of official abuse of British Muslim activists in Arab countries, apparently using British-supplied intelligence, who are then pressed to work for the British security services when they return home.</p><p>What is indisputable is that there were no jihadist attacks in Britain before&nbsp;9/11, itself claimed as a response to US support for Arab dictatorships, Israeli occupation and murderous sanctions on Iraq. Wars supposedly fought to keep Britain safe have been shown to do the exact opposite.</p><p>Given the bloodshed, torture, mass incarceration and destruction that US-British occupation has inflicted on Afghanistan and Iraq, and the civilian slaughter inflicted in the drone war from Pakistan to Yemen, the only surprise is that there haven't been more terror attacks.</p><p>Three years ago <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/british-troops-afghan-civilian-shootings?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">WikiLeaks gave a glimpse</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/oct/04/uk-forces-afghan-civilians-deaths\" title=\"\">routine killing</a> of Afghan civilians by British troops – as did the jailing for 18 months of a grenadier guardsman for stabbing an Afghan boy who asked him for chocolate. Now Britain is preparing to supply weapons directly to the Islamist-dominated rebels in Syria. But at home ministers want to use their \"<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fuploads%2Fsystem%2Fuploads%2Fattachment_data%2Ffile%2F97976%2Fprevent-strategy-review.pdf&amp;ei=s_ykUZCxE4aI7AaY54DICg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBhIIFsaVa4SEE7xSSSdE8a1hxGQ&amp;sig2=9yUFxUnrw33g6w85vy64BA&amp;bvm=bv.47008514,d.ZGU\" title=\"\">Prevent strategy</a>\" to freeze out still further nonviolent Islamist groups that have been most effective at isolating those drawn to violence.</p><p>Denial of the role of US-British wars, occupations and interventions in the Muslim world in fuelling terror attacks at home helps to get politicians off the hook. But it also plays into the hands of those blaming multiculturalism and migration, feeding racism and Islamophobia in the process. The wars should be ended because they are wrong and a failure – but also because they fuel terrorism and divide communities.</p><p>Those who carried out last week's killing are of course responsible for what they did. But those who have sent British troops to wage war in the Arab and Muslim world for more than a decade must share culpability.</p><p><em>• </em>Comments on this thread will be premoderated <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/28/woolwich-attacks-turning-off-comments\" title=\"\">for legal reasons</a></p><p>• Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\">@SeumasMilne</a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/28/1369770828650/British-soldiers-in-Afgha-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/29/britain-wars-terror-islamophobia","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/may/29/britain-wars-terror-islamophobia","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"How can financial services work best for the poor?","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-28T16:06:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/may/28/financial-services-global-development-best-bits","fields":{"body":"<h2><strong>Brigit Helms, director, </strong><a href=\"http://www.dai.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Speed programme</strong></a><strong>, DAI, Maputo, Mozambique. @helmshart</strong></h2><p><strong>Design products according to your customers' behaviour:</strong> The key to designing the right kinds of services is to figure out how to develop products that mimic as closely as possible what people are already doing, but better. Integrating savings groups into the formal financial system is one way, in some ways mobile money is another way, for example by enabling tiny payments, transfers and deposits.</p><p><strong>Embrace mobile technology:</strong> The vast potential of mobile technology has still not been realised throughout most of Africa. There needs to be more investment in understanding the real needs of clients, and building the up mobile agent network properly.</p><h2><strong>Timothy Ogden, managing director, </strong><a href=\"http://financialaccess.org\" title=\"\"><strong>Financial Access Initiative</strong></a><strong>, New York City, US. @timothyogden</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Remember that cash costs money</strong>: Most people think of cash as free, and other systems as costing something. But this isn't the case, as demonstrated by what's continuing to happen with small businesses and credit cards in the United States. Many small businesses refuse to take credit cards or charge a premium for using them when economic analysis suggests that their costs of handling cash are far higher than the fees for card transactions.</p><p><strong>Be dynamic enough to adjust to changing contexts and needs</strong>: People, contexts, technologies, incentives, and funding surrounding financial services all change regularly. As soon as regulation finds a balance, some new product, service or technology emerges to challenge the status quo. Think about how spectacularly some of the oldest banking regulation systems in the world failed to protect customers in the lead up to the global financial crisis. The aim of financial service design, therefore, should not be about getting it right, but about being dynamic and adjustable.</p><p><strong>Resources:</strong> </p><p>Dignity within financial inclusion is often referred to, but can't be defined easily. Susan Johnson's paper, '<a href=\"http://www.swiftinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-01-FIRC-Susan-Johnson.pdf\" title=\"\">Competing visions of financial inclusion in Kenya'</a> (pdf) is a usual piece that introduces the varying definitions of dignity.</p><p>Measuring financial inclusion can be a complicated process. Ignacio Mas <a href=\"http://www.financialaccess.org/blog/2013/04/measuring-and-missing-financial-inclusion\" title=\"\">discusses the difficulty of measurement</a>, in a Financial Access blog.</p><h2><strong>Lily Bowles, associate, <a href=\"http://www.vilcap.com/‎\">Village Capital</a>, Washington, DC, US. @villagecapital</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Improve education</strong>: Improving financial literacy in developing countries is key to achieving universal financial inclusion. US organisation <a href=\"http://moneythink.org/\" title=\"\">MoneyThink</a> offers 10-week financial literacy courses for urban high school students to help build money management skills. Undergraduate college students volunteer to teach. Development organisations could replicate this peer-to-peer model, as it helps foster a trusting community that can speak about finances in terms younger students will understand and enjoy, and it cuts down on costs.</p><h2><strong>Elisabeth Rhyne, managing director, </strong><a href=\"http://www.centerforfinancialinclusion.org\" title=\"\"><strong>Centre for financial inclusion at Accion</strong></a><strong>, Washington, DC, US</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Message clients in different ways</strong>: There will always be a marketing element in financial capability building offered by financial institutions, so avenues of information such as schools and mass media are important. Clients should have access to balanced information. Sometimes the message they need to hear will advise them not to borrow, to take a smaller loan or ask questions about hidden fees.</p><p><strong>Protect your customers</strong>: Service providers need to see it as their responsibility first and foremost to protect consumers. Regulations should be seen as the second line of defense. Unfortunately, much of the time, both regulators and providers see client protection through the narrow lens of regulatory compliance.</p><h2><strong>Peter Gakure Mwangi, mobile payments professional, </strong><a href=\"http://www.kopokopo.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Kopo Kopo Inc.</strong></a><strong>, Nairobi, Kenya. @PeterAfrica</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Governments should build enabling regulation</strong>: The Kenyan experience shows that a research-backed collaboration between a government and making markets work for the poor (M4P) financial inclusion organisations is the best way to develop regulations that will drive financial inclusion among the unbanked. In Kenya, the regulator is working with a <a href=\"http://www.fsdkenya.org\" title=\"\">financial services deepening programme</a>.</p><h2><strong>Betty Wilkinson, director of public management, financial sector and trade division, central and West Asia department, </strong><a href=\"http://www.adb.org\" title=\"\"><strong>Asian Development Bank</strong></a><strong>, Manila, Philippines</strong></h2><p><strong>Be demand driven</strong>: While microcredit is more ubiquitous than it was, savings services are still a challenge, remittances are still expensive and microinsurance programmes that serve the real needs of the poor still rare internationally. Such services cost a lot to develop, but studying the demand for them can help keep them relevant to the users.</p><h2><strong>Joanna Ledgerwood, senior advisor, </strong><a href=\"http://www.akdn.org\" title=\"\"><strong>Aga Khan Foundation</strong></a><strong>, Geneva Switzerland</strong><br /></h2><p><strong>Governments play complex roles:</strong> For helpful information on the role of government in financial inclusion, see chapter 3 (on the role of government and industry in financial inclusion) and chapter 17 (on regulation) in <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/12272/9780821389270.pdf\" title=\"\">The new microfinance handbook</a> (pdf), published by the World Bank.</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

Maybe it was a project you visited and actually saw firsthand the difference it was making to a community ; or maybe it was a carefully considered piece of evaluation showing exceptional results. More likely than not, that project was helping a few hundred people or even a few thousand – but the scale of the need stretched to the hundreds of thousands, if not millions.</p><p>This problem of scale really bothers me: why do we have so much trouble capturing ideas that work and spreading them? It's a question we grapple with at the not-for-profit I founded, the <a href=\"http://www.the-icsf.org/\" title=\"\">International Centre for Social Franchising</a> (ICSF), so when pharmaceutical giant, <a href=\"http://www.gsk.com/\" title=\"\">GlaxoSmithKline</a> commissioned <a href=\"http://www.the-icsf.org/new-report-identifying-replicable-healthcare-models-with-significant-social-benefit/\" title=\"\">a review of 900 healthcare delivery initiatives</a> in emerging economies for their potential to replicate to scale, it seemed the ideal opportunity to answer that question.</p><p>Our first challenge was data. Usually the issue in the social sector is that there isn't any, but in our case we were lucky enough to have the <a href=\"http://healthmarketinnovations.org/programs\" title=\"\">Center for Health Marketing Innovations</a> database. That said, it did need a couple of weeks of work from our team of four before it could be analysed but CHMI has since committed to improve its usability following recommendations in the report. (If any of you have used it and have feedback please let us know.)</p><p>Sifting through a vast quantity of data to decide the innovations that needed a second look was the next challenge. After putting a lot of thought into the characteristics of organisations that had successfully replicated, we developed a simple five-point binary scale to bring to the fore the most exciting models:</p><p><strong>1. Scalable:</strong> potential to radically increase number of beneficiaries.</p><p><strong>2. Impact:</strong> scale of the impact on beneficiaries.</p><p><strong>3. Time Horizon:</strong> potential for implementation within five years.</p><p><strong>4. Sustainable:</strong> clear consistent revenue stream.</p><p><strong>5. Innovative:</strong> provides a novel approach.</p><p>Of course, once we get into the detail of choosing projects more information is needed, but we found this list so helpful as an initial filter that we have used it on a couple of other quite different projects since and it holds up.</p><p>Using these five points we selected the top 50 projects and the team then visited them in India and Kenya, identified as in our research as the two greatest \"hotbeds\" in healthcare innovation. In each country, we used a set of more detailed questions to assess each of the projects for scalability. Getting these questions right is critical and we drew upon resources like the our <a href=\"http://socialenterprise.guardian.co.uk/social-enterprise-network/2013/apr/10/social-enterprise-replicate-10-question-test\" title=\"\">replication readiness test</a>, and similar tools from <a href=\"http://www.bridgespan.org/Publications-and-Tools/Strategy-Development/Section2/Getting-Replication-Right-The-Decisions-That-M.aspx#.URgaxqVWx8E\" title=\"\">Bridgespan</a>, the US not-for-profit consultancy, and the helpful <a href=\"http://www.socialimpactexchange.org/exchange/knowledge-center\" title=\"\">Social Impact Exchange</a>.</p><p>But what is sold on websites and databases as self-sustaining more often than not doesn't hold up under scrutiny. So early on we learnt to ask interviewees: \"Where does the money come from?\" Another revealing question was: \"When did your business model last change?\"  Many projects are difficult to scale up because they have been pivoted more than a few times since being founded, and lacked direction.</p><p>Still, the opportunity to visit so many projects with the intention of comparing them and finding scalable models did provide lots of food for thought:</p><p>• Successful social businesses know exactly what their hyper-price sensitive customers are willing to pay and target their services accordingly. In one case a social enterprise was able to accurately project what a $0.02 increase in price would have on their market.</p><p>• These same businesses segment their poor customers and more often than not end up targeting the richer middle- to upper-class market. In many cases this means that, rather serving the most needy, services are inaccessible to up to half of the poor.</p><p>• We thought that there would be a load of great projects needing a lot of money to scale but there weren't. Actually, there were a few really stand out projects with more funding than they could ever absorb – in this case, often from large pharma, impact investors (investors claiming to be interested in social returns as well as money) and folk just interested in making money.</p><p>• We identified six clear project types that would be useful to others who need to categorise healthcare initiatives: information and communication technology (ICT), skills training, devices and equipment, infrastructure, financing, and social marketing. Out of these we found that infrastructure and financing projects were especially interesting from a replication to scale perspective, and even more so when the two are combined together. This challenged another preconception that simple projects can be scaled up most effectively: actually, it's complex projects made simple through systemisation. This is very hard to do and deserving of its own article.</p><p>Returning to the question posed at the start, then, the truth is that we have so much trouble scaling projects because it is really hard to do. It dawned on us that even if individual organisations were absolutely brilliant, endowed with powerful leaders and financial might, they still need a whole ecosystem of innovation to develop around them to power them to success and scale. This ecosystem creation cannot be borne solely by one organisation or even by a government but requires collaboration across sectors and disciplines: joined-up thinking.</p><p>GSK listened to our recommendations and we have helped them pull together a really interesting group of people to start a conversation about practical ways to take healthcare social enterprises to scale. People around the table are as diverse as GSK's traditional competitors such as Novartis, Microsoft, the Department for International Development (DfID) and some brilliant academics.

Now we're talking about the G8 summit on the 17th and 18th June.

Can we have a round of applause for them please?</p><p>Now we asked via our website and on Twitter for your questions. They came in by the electronic sackful, if such a thing exists, so let's crack on with those and the first question from Billy Hill.</p><p></p><p><strong>Billy</strong> Hello. My question is to the panel: do you think the government should enshrine in law the 0.7 aid promise?</p><p><strong>HM </strong>Thank you, Billy. And dovetailing quite nicely with that was a question that we received from Sally Copley. I'm not sure if Sally's here, but with the announcement at the budget this year that the UK government is the first country in the G8 to meet the 0.7% commitment made in 1970, has the UK government done enough? Jamie?</p><p><strong>JD </strong>Has the UK government done enough? Not yet. We're talking about aid here but there's a lot more than aid that needs to be talked about, obviously, and we'll do that over the course of the hour. Regarding aid, the UK is taking up a fantastic leadership position. It's off the back of a generation of campaigning by people across the country and by leaders on both sides of the isle, and long may that continue. It's a fantastic tradition and it needs to keep going.</p><p></p><p>We need to make sure that the way we consolidate support for 0.7 now doesn't have long-term negative consequences. So we need to make sure that we're giving people feedback about the great results of smart aid investments; both on the easier-to-explain things like vaccines, bednets, kids in school immunised; but also the more complicated things like helping countries strengthen their tax bases, build up their revenue collection, invest in infrastructure – the sort of long-term stuff that will help these countries eventually grow, have inclusive and sustainable growth so that they can eventually graduate away from the need for aid in the long term. And so I think, yes, we've played a fantastic leadership role in all of this, there's always more to do and there's also a beyond aid agenda we need to talk about.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH </strong>Specifically on Billy's question, Justin, should the government enshrine this in law because it's not a done deal, is it? And then every day you hear discussions as to whether or not they should keep that promise …</p><p><strong>JF </strong>No, I think they should keep the promise. It was a commitment by all the parties in their manifestos and also part of the coalition agreement. And I think we must keep up the pressure so that they do enshrine the 0.7% in law. I think the most important thing though is that they've also achieved 0.7 and this is a 40-year commitment put into practice. I think it's actually a huge tribute to the British public. I remember, I worked in 2005 during the last year at Gleneagles for Tony Blair, and I went home to the village I come from in Oxfordshire in Deddington, and on the church was \"Make Poverty History\" And I think the commitment and passion for debt cancellation, for aid, for making Aids drugs affordable for the poorest families, and mums and dads and children in the world, is really deep in the DNA of our country.</p><p></p><p>And I know in these tough times it feels, for some people, like it's something we can't afford, but I believe that millions of people up and down the country who support Oxfam or Christian Aid or Action Aid or ONE or Save the Children – and there are millions of them who really passionately believe that – and that's why, and I saw this when I worked in Downing Street, politicians have picked up and carried this torch for international development, which includes achieving the 0.7% target. And I think that is – as a country – something that we should be very proud of.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH</strong> Ruth, how do we, having got to this stage, remain at this stage or maybe even improve that position?</p><p><strong>RB </strong>I think it wouldn't be a bad thing to see 0.7 enshrined in law and it was a shame that it wasn't in the Queen's speech. However, for me, 0.7 is really only a small part of the picture and we know, partly through the IF campaign, that African countries lose twice as much in unpaid taxes as they receive in aid in the first place. So I think aid's great, I think it's part of our commitment to developing countries, given that we structure the global economy in the way that we do disadvantages them. I think it's a normal thing that we should be doing. And, of course, we should be pleased that the UK's leading the way, but really as far as I'm concerned, it's not enough.</p><p></p><p>Make Poverty History in 2005 did indeed achieve some significant steps forward on aid. And we saw some steps forward on debt, although they didn't really address some of the structural problems as we would like to have seen. And of course we got very little on trade. I think what's really worrying coming out of the G8 at the moment is this push for further and deeper trade liberalisation, it's this idea of trade as a sort of panacea, and this idea that we can go for yet more market liberalisation without tailoring it to actually addressing some of the remaining and deeply entrenched poverty that we still see. So I think 0.7 why not, but I think there are many more things that we need to see this government doing.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH</strong> OK, thank you for that. Before I bring in Larry, there's another question that was sent in by Ade. Fire away.</p><p><strong>Ade </strong>In this time of global recession, is giving aid important to these G8 countries?</p><p><strong>LE </strong>Is giving aid important? Well, it's important to some countries, I don't think it's important to enough of the G8 countries and a lot of the countries have not met the pledges that they made in Gleneagles all those years ago. Britain's got a good record but other countries, Italy for one, France, Germany – they've not kept the pledges that they made. I think it's a shame that the government here didn't enshrine the 0.7% in law; and I think to an extent Cameron's bottled it. I think he's been under a lot of pressure from the right wing of the Conservative party and I think he's just lost his nerve. And I think that's a great pity because I think 70p in every £100 of national income going on aid is not a vast amount of money. And I think, as Jamie said, aid has got a good record of doing good things in developing countries; the kids in school, medicines in hospital – aid works and it's important for the government to make that case, whether it be a government of the left or the right. And I think this government is starting to recoil from some of its aid and development pledges. I think what it did by not enshrining the 0.7 in law is symbolic of that.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH </strong>Jamie, you work around the world, how do you compare our view on aid and our commitment to the 0.7 with what you see elsewhere?</p><p><strong>JD </strong>Well, there are many other countries in the world so it depends on where else you're talking about. Your question, Ade, was about the G8. The UK's in a crazily positive position compared to – crazy in an American sense of we're wildly out there in going to 0.7 and actually making it happen, compared with other countries. And it's very hard for people who are citizens of this country to really appreciate how different the vibe is about this in France or Italy, the degree to which people really aren't there for this issue.</p><p></p><p>And so when a G8 summit happens, it's a multilateral moment: it's lots of countries trying to agree together on something. If you all – because of the pressure from your citizens – are very far out on an issue and the citizens of other countries aren't putting pressure on their political leaders to be equally far out, you have a hard job. So to some extent – and I'm not making any apologies for anything that this country and this government isn't doing – but rather pointing out that they can only do so much if the German citizens aren't pressuring Merkel and if French citizens or Italian citizens aren't pressuring their leaders, and we need to be working harder with partners around the world to put pressure on their respective leaders. But the G8 is one thing, you've said elsewhere so at some stage in this next hour, let's please talk about the emerging economies, the Brics and other countries because it's a complicated, much more difficult environment in which we're working now compared with 2005 or '98 – the last times we hosted a G8 – and in many ways that's welcome but it does make campaigning a little more difficult.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH </strong>Justin, what the politicians will do and what we ask them to do is quite important but there's a difficulty sometimes for the charities in that some have said that some of the charities are too close to Number 10 and to David Cameron and things like the IF campaign. Is there a danger there? I mean you want to work closely with them, you need their buy-in, but is there a danger of getting too close?</p><p><strong>JF </strong>Yes, I think there's always that danger and I've been on both sides of the fence so maybe I have been too close at different times. The only thing [where] I disagree with Larry slightly is, I do think David Cameron also deserves a lot of credit for sticking to 0.7% in very tough times; which is probably going to prove the point that I'm too close to David Cameron even though I used to work for the old government anyway.</p><p><strong>LE </strong>You're close to all of them.</p><p><strong>JF </strong>Close to all of them. But I do think that in this particular environment at the moment – we've had many years of an economic downturn, we've got a debate raging in the UK which is mainly about immigration and Europe. Aid is disliked by a large section of those people that are moving in effect to Ukip. I think they deserve some credit for sticking to the 0.7% pledge.</p><p></p><p>I think our job in tough times with Enough Food for Everyone campaign, the IF campaign, was to try to get the maximum possible in a difficult, political environment. It's not the same as in the year 2000 with \"Jubilee 2000\" or 2005 with Make Poverty History, this campaign is not as big as those campaigns. But the environment and the susceptibility of the public isn't there either. But I think – and I was just telling a story as we were walking in – I bumped into (this shows again probably that I'm too close) … I bumped into George Osborne the other day, like you do, and he said that one of the remarkable things about the development movement is it was on the map. Now I know Larry disagreed with that in an article recently, but the night before the budget on both the ITV, BBC and Channel 4 news, Enough Food for Everyone, the IF campaign stunt was there about why we should stick to our pledge on aid and, as Ruth rightly says, do more than aid as well as stick to taking action on tax.</p><p></p><p>So I think in a difficult time we're trying to put pressure on but we're also trying to do the insider job. And basically I think, as Malcolm X said, you have to take any means possible or necessary to achieve change. And we have to have different tactics and strategies at different moments in history. And at this moment in history it's bloody tough to achieve change and we might have to do an insider bit and an outsider bit but I think we are making some progress.</p><p></p><p>And we've got 10 days in June with three summits and we could get a big result on tax, we could get a big result on transparency and we could get a big result on nutrition – and that's a lot to play for. And millions of people in this country who care should come out on 8 June in Hyde Park, and then in Belfast, and put as much pressure on the G8 to deliver as possible.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH </strong>I want to ask Larry about what he did write quite recently about the IF campaign but first of all, Ruth, Justin's quoting Malcolm X at us – how do you see …</p><p><strong>JD </strong>Badly, I think.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>How do you see this calibration between the campaigning organisations and the politicians and is it possible for us to be too close – is that a bad thing if you get close?</p><p><strong>RB </strong>I think I mean what I'm really interested in is this idea that it's difficult to engage people in development issues in times like this. Because people are living through things that have not been seen for a generation almost; we're living through huge problems with debt, huge problems with finance, tax issues in the UK – these are all issues developing countries have been dealing with for the past 40 years. So I think more than ever now is the time to say to people, \"look we need global solidarity between people in different countries, and we need to really engage people with the things that they're facing on a daily basis.\"</p><p>And I think that is happening when you look across Europe in Spain and Greece, there's huge mobilisation behind these issues. And they are connecting with movements beyond the EU on issues that are really hitting home. In the next year, we're going to see austerity hitting the UK in a way that we haven't experienced yet. And I think as a movement we need to use this even more to engage with people in the south who are already campaigning hard on these kind of things.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>Larry, if you voiced some concerns about it, just give us a sense of what they are.</p><p></p><p><strong>LE </strong>Well, I've covered a lot of G8 summits and I've covered a lot of development issues over the years. My view of IF is that I totally accept that this is a completely different environment from 2005 or even the late 1990s when the Jubilee 2000 campaign was up and running. But my view of IF is that it just hasn't worked. It just hasn't captured the public imagination in the way those previous campaigns did. It lacks, in my view, focus, sharpness and energy. And it's virtually not talked about anywhere in the way that Make Poverty History was. Make Poverty History was part of the political fabric, it was part of the wider discourse back in 2005. And I fully accept this is not 2005, but I just don't think that IF has captured the imagination in any way.</p><p></p><p>I'm sure that, as always, the G8 summit will come up with a form of words and an agreement on some of the issues that Cameron is putting forward; but old cynic that I am I know that G8 leaders – once they get on those planes and leave Northern Ireland in mid-June – will almost certainly forget everything they've put on those pieces of paper and not actually fulfil them. So I don't think the politicians feel under any real pressure to deliver it in the way that they did certainly … I remember going to Cologne in 1998 and seeing the place ringed with protesters and that did actually make people like Bill Clinton, [former German chancellor Gerhard] Schroder, sit up and take notice. I just don't think the current crop of politicians at the G8 feel under any obligational pressure to do anything at the G8.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH </strong>Well, it has its signature event in Hyde Park on 8 June, the same day as the hunger summit, so let's see if that impacts on things, but in the meantime let's move on to another question. Let's talk a bit about tax and we've a question here [that] says: the Starbucks, Amazon and other large corporation tax scandals that have been unveiled over the last year mean that change to the UK's tax system was inevitable, how do we ensure that these changes really allow developing countries to share in the benefits from day one and don't just create a tighter system that further locks developing countries out of the global economy? Jamie, that's one for you.</p><p><strong>JD </strong>There's two sides to this. In fact, there's three – what was it that somebody said? \"It takes three to tango in this case.\" There's the money that's escaping from developing country economies; there's the bribe, there's a bribee and then there's the accountants and lawyers who facilitate the transaction. And a lot of these people work and live in the murkier parts of the offshore financial system.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to transfer mispricing that enables multinational corporations to get away with not paying the taxes they should in these countries, we've got to tighten up the offshore financial system. And that requires the G8 making serious progress on public registries of beneficial ownership, tax conventions and information exchange – that enables developing countries to track down where this money has gone. And a lot of the agreements might be between the G8 nations, they won't necessarily let in developing countries. They have to let in developing countries to be able to track down and follow their money. But developing countries also need to have the capacity to do that. And the opening up of things, the transparency part of it, everyone's quite clear on and we need to be pushing hard on that, and campaigning hard on that, it's part of what the IF campaign's pushing on, we're all on that message.</p><p></p><p>The slightly more boring, nerdy bit of building up the capacity of revenue collection authorities and so on it mustn't drop that from the equation; that needs a lot of attention too. So we need to do both parts of that.</p><p><strong>MH</strong> Justin, do you sense that there's a will for that because it's a big ask, isn't it?</p><p><strong>JF </strong>I think this is one of the most exciting areas of what's on the G8 agenda.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>He said it was nerdy.</p><p><strong>JF </strong>Well, it's nerdy and exciting and this is where I also partly disagree with Larry about this summit not achieving anything. I think Gleneagles achieved a lot, but I think the difference with this summit is that it's taking on some more kind of transformational issues than just aid and other traditional development issues. If it could make a little bit of progress on tax and transparency, that could unlock many more resources for development. And I think the heart of it and what actually Cameron's been talking to Obama about, is this whole nerdy area of beneficial ownership, of about tax havens and how much the information will be exchanged with poor countries not just other developed countries.</p><p></p><p>And there's a big debate going on with Germany, Japan and America not really wanting the same level of openness that the UK want on knowing who really owns a company, that transparency, so that the money can't be hidden. Not really wanting the information to be exchanged completely on a global level. So this idea of a public registry which goes to the heart of what could come out a G8 if it was agreed is a big, I know, nerdy point, but is actually one that could unlock billions of dollars for development in the poorest countries.</p><p></p><p>I think Jamie's right, though, that there's another side of this which is that even if you unlock that money, is it going to be used to build schools, build health clinics? It feels to me a bit like on tax at the moment, it feels a bit – and Larry you should say, you were writing on this at the time I remember even the articles – 1993 on debt when we actually haven't quite developed the language to talk about this and it all sounds too complicated. The real breakthrough on debt was when we linked debt cancellation to peoples' lives. And I think we have to get better at talking about how getting better policies on tax and tax havens, beneficial ownership is actually about children living or dying, children going to school, mums and dads having a chance in life to make a living to be able to bring up their kids properly and we haven't quite got that, so it all sounds a little bit opaque. But I give quite a lot of credit to the UK government for pushing the boat out on tax, it's a difficult issue but if we made some progress at this G8 it could unlock a lot of money.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH </strong>Ruth, do you sense that there's a common will to do this because you need a real push to be able to impact on multinational firms such as Starbucks and Amazon to make sure this tax does get paid.</p><p><strong>RB </strong>Absolutely, and it's good to see that there's movement on tax. But coming from the Trade Justice Movement, you would expect me to bring things back to trade and I think there's a contradiction in Cameron saying that he wants to do a lot on tax while at the same time wanting to pursue further trade liberalisation because we know that for many of the poorest countries a lot of their government revenues come from trade taxes, that's tariffs at the border. If you're pushing to reduce these, you're pushing to reduce what amounts for some countries to 30% of their budget and they can't make that up through other means. There's often this suggestion they should make it up through VAT, for example, but we know it's incredibly hard to collect VAT, it takes a long time to put the infrastructure in place to collect that.</p><p></p><p>So I think we need a bit more coherence between the agendas on tax and the agenda on trade and we need to make sure that, in parallel to all the moves on tax, we also see some sensible thinking on trade that doesn't insist on ever increasing liberalisation and does recognise that different countries need different policy space and different means to address these issues.</p><p><strong>LE </strong>Just three quick points: the development community's been a bit slow to pick up on tax. Some of the aid agencies have been very good on this and have pushing on it for quite a long time and I think generally the movement has been quite slow in picking up on tax as an issue. And the second point is that it's quite obvious why that is – it's  because lots of rich and powerful people use tax havens to salt away their money and it's a tough nut to crack.</p><p></p><p>But the third thing, and I think it's quite exciting, it's the one area where I think there is real hope for political change in the short term, and that's because a lot of G8 governments need the dosh. People like George Osborne, I don't doubt his development credentials for a minute, but actually he's got a £120bn hole in his budget that he needs to fill. So the idea that Starbucks and Google and the rest of them are not paying their tax is not just a development issue for him, it's a homegrown issue.</p><p></p><p>And where I think the development community can actually make a difference here is by linking the domestic and the development agenda, and actually that's the way to build a coalition and a new campaign is by saying to people, \"Look, we can crack down on tax havens. It means more money for schools and hospitals at home and it also means more money for schools and hospitals in emerging market countries and in sub-Saharan Africa.\" And that is a very, very fertile ground because I think the general public while Justin's right to say this is a much more difficult climate and there are lots of people who support Ukip who are not really natural supporters of development, to say the least, they are also completely outraged by what's going on in tax havens, and by the way in which Google and Starbucks are not paying their fair share.</p><p></p><p>So I think there is real fertile ground there and it's a really promising area for the development community not just over the next month but over the next few years. It's just like debt relief was back in the early 1990s. There's lots of scope for progress there.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>So, George Osborne says something sensible – shocker! Let's move to another question from Andrew Palmer about transparency.</p><p><strong>Andrew </strong>Hi, Andrew Palmer from Development Initiatives. At present, only four of the G8 countries have published to the International Aid Transparency Initiative – the UK, the US, Canada and Germany. My question to the panel is: does the panel agree that G8 countries should prioritise the information needs of developing countries and fulfil the transparency commitments they made at Busan?</p><p><strong>MH </strong>Justin?</p><p><strong>JF </strong>Yes and NGOs too and all people that work in the aid and development world should be transparent and more accountable. And I think this is a big and positive move that's happening. I think it links all the issues on the agenda at the G8 whether it's tax, whether it's to do with extractives, even to do with nutrition and the whole issue around land grabs, which is one of the other issues that we're campaigning on as part of Enough Food for Everyone. So I think the power of information and transparency particularly.</p><p></p><p>You know the world has changed dramatically since 2005 and even more since 2000. At Gleneagles, I think Facebook was just operating at Harvard. So we've got mass of new technology, access to Twitter, Facebook, we've got grass movements – I've just come back from Kenya, where you can criticise the elections but the groundswell of popular mobilisation around those elections, the information exchange, is really powerful. So if we can put information into the hands of people, they can hold companies to account, governments to account, big organised NGOs like Save the Children to account. I think that revolution is just beginning to happen.</p><p></p><p>And I think one of the other positive things that's on the G8 agenda which is all to play for is around the extractive industry's transparency initiative. If we can build on that and what's happened in America is it, Jamie, the Dodds Frank …</p><p><strong>JD </strong>Dodds Frank…</p><p><strong>JF </strong>Dodds Frank legislation, which if someone like Canada picked up, we've also started doing something in Europe. Again, opening up that information, I think, is extremely powerful.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>Ruth, David Cameron was visibly very excited about the transparency bit of his blueprint, are you?</p><p><strong>RB </strong>I think it's probably going to be a useful thing in and of itself. But again I've got to bring it back to trade. The lack of transparency in the trade deals that we're seeing is really shocking. Take India, for example, where people are starting to see that it's a deal that could rob them of access to cheap medicines, it could influence their ability to access seeds, which I think the IF campaign should be looking at in terms of access to food and nutrition. And we know that not only has civil society had no access to any of the documents but there's been very little access from the Indian parliament.</p><p></p><p>In terms of transparency, it's great if we can get it on things like Aids, but we really need to push this out further. I would like to make a plug for a campaign success on access to information. We saw the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement turned back from the EU last year, which was a real success for campaigners trying to defend freedom of information on the internet. So that was really fantastic and can demonstrate not only the importance of access to information for campaigners but that we can win.</p><p></p><p><strong>JF</strong> Can I just say that I know we're all violently agreeing, but I would just disagree with Ruth a little bit. I think one of the problems in the NGO sector has been on trade. I think we've completely underestimated the power of trade and growth to lift people out of poverty. That doesn't mean that we believe completely in full liberalisation or believe in no rules; it doesn't mean you don't need to address issues about power in markets in terms of access to information. But I think one of the tragedies of the last few years is we haven't had the Doha trade deal. And as a result we have had more survival of the fittest, some very big countries doing trade deals. And during that whole Doha round, all the NGOs were completely against trade deals bar a few like Oxfam, and that was a real shame. And I think the NGOs have to get more into the benefits of trading growth and I think that's where most poor people are.</p><p></p><p><strong>RB </strong>Can I respond quickly to that because I think it's a bit of a misrepresentation. If you look at our founding principles, it says very clearly that we are in favour of trade, and we're in favour of a fair multilateral system. Now we happen to think that the WTO is not it, and we happen to think that Doha was the wrong agreement for developing countries. And the reason why it stalled is because developing countries didn't want it. The reason why the economic partnership agreement stalled is also because developing countries don't want them. So I think it's a bit of a misrepresentation to say that trade is always good when many developing countries are objecting to the agreements that are being put on the table.</p><p></p><p><strong>JF </strong>I don't think that Doha stalled because of developing countries not wanting it. Brazil in America couldn't reach a deal on some quite complex industrial and agricultural issues. That's why it stalled.</p><p><strong>RB </strong>And India pushed back on agriculture.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>I'm going to have to intervene there because we're going to take a short break; we've done tax and transparency, a lot more questions but we'll be back in just a moment.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH </strong>Welcome back to our special edition of the Global development podcast. Our next question is from Laura Taylor.</p><p><strong>Laura </strong>Thanks. I realise I'm just about to mark myself out as the token tree hugger in the room but …</p><p><strong>MH </strong>We love those too.</p><p><strong>Laura </strong>If the G8 concentrate on promoting existing models of economic growth without recognising that climate change is threatening the lives and the food security of millions of people, could it be argued that they're just fiddling while Rome burns?</p><p><strong>MH </strong>Jamie, are they fiddling?</p><p><strong>JD </strong>Look, this G8 summit can't get everything done in one go and I think something that has definitely occurred in the last few years is that the power of the G8 has somewhat diminished to get everything done. And there's still a big hangover since Copenhagen for a set of environmental issues.</p><p>What I would say is that I was in Africa last week at the World Economic Forum meetings in Cape Town and you do get a sense of a continent, at least, that could go in a few different directions, and there are policymakers there who really are interested in sustainable (in both senses of the word), inclusive economic growth, where you can be less carbon intensive, you can lift people out of poverty, you can do a whole set of things that the tree huggers and the people who like economic growth can all agree on.</p><p></p><p>You've got other people who just want growth as quickly as possible, just to reduce poverty as quickly as possible. You've just got other people who want growth so they can make for themselves and other elites as much money as quickly as possible. And those decisions are being made now at a very fast and furious pace. So I think while it is important to put pressure on the G8 and get some of those policies right, working more closely with those African policymakers who are making really important decisions about what kinds of carbon intensive growth they will have in the future is really important. Sub-Saharan Africa could become a global green growth hub and leapfrog, as it has with the mobile phone, a whole series of technologies that we've had to go through. And that's really exciting.</p><p></p><p>And sometimes I think the tree-hugger crowd – of which I have often been a part – tends to focus on the hair shirt and not the exciting opportunities. And that's something that I would say as a campaigner is often a tactical mistake. There are some excellent opportunities to invest in renewables on the continent, which could be a really exciting story for us all to agree on.</p><p><strong>MH</strong> Larry, you've talked about the fact that the context here is this financial crisis and that's the backdrop to this – does that mean that climate change won't be such a factor, can't be such a factor?</p><p><strong>LE </strong>Well, I think inevitably it isn't such a factor. It's not such a factor in domestic politics and it's not as big a factor in global politics. That's why an international agreement is proving incredibly hard to achieve on climate change. Politicians traditionally treat green politics or the environment as a luxury they can afford when times are good, which is why it was a big issue here in the first part of the 2000s, in the latter half of the 1980s, and the early part of the 1970s – all boom times for the western economy. When times are tough, people concentrate on other things such as growth and jobs and living standards, that's just the reality.</p><p></p><p>I think Laura's question is absolutely right. If the G8 does concentrate on growth at all costs, then we will fry the planet. I think most G8 countries do understand that there is a limit to growth in itself. One of the things that they should be looking at is using aid budgets to help developing countries adapt to the problems of climate change and lay the foundations of the green sustainable growth that Jamie was talking about because it is going to be very costly.</p><p></p><p>I interviewed Jim [Yong] Kim from the World Bank here a few weeks ago and he was very passionate about the need to start tackling climate change. So I don't think it's an issue that G8 politicians are unaware of, it's just that it is a G8 – what are you going to do without the buy-in of India and China – those are the two massive developing … and Brazil, I mean they're not members of the G8 so any agreement that the G8 could come up with on climate change would not really be worth very much without the commitment of some of the bigger developing nations.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH </strong>You mentioned China, hold that thought for just a moment because we had a question from Christina Totina. Let me read this to you. She said: \"In light of China's £75bn spend on aid and development projects in Africa over the past decade, how relevant is the G8 without China on board?\" It's a good point isn't it, Justin?</p><p><strong>JF </strong>It is and I think in a way the G20 has become an even more important forum in recent years, particularly since we last held the G8 in 2005. But I think also the G20 hasn't fulfilled its potential. It's interesting, having sat in a few G20 meetings and G8 meetings; the G8 was small enough to reach decisions and drive things forward; with the G20, there are so many around the table. It's a lot more than 20 – they say G20, but it actually gets up to 26 or 7 when you have people sitting on each other's laps around the table. And it [G20] found it hard apart from in London, and before that in Washington, in the midst of the financial crisis to actually agree anything much in substance to drive things forward.</p><p>And I think part of the problem is, is we've got very big powerful countries like China and India and Brazil there, Mexico, I think, is a bit of an exception, who are there fighting their corner but they're not yet fighting for big global results for everyone in the way that some members of the G8 have done at previous moments in history. So I think we're kind of caught in no man's land between an illegitimate G8, not yet a functioning G20, and without a multilateral system that's even wider that works.</p><p>To the previous question on climate change; in the next few years, we should reach – if we were really taking on the global problems – a global agreement on climate change, a global agreement on trade and shaping the post-2015 global poverty targets; and probably only that latter one on what comes after the millennium development goals will agree because multilateralism, the G20, the G8 are not able to actually come up with those types of agreements. And that puts a big responsibility on people to stand up and demand some of this change that we need.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH </strong>So, Ruth, it asks fundamental questions about the G8 doesn't it? It's has it got the right members and are they doing the right things?</p><p><strong>RB </strong>I think Justin raises an interesting question. For me, it's more a question of legitimacy. Why is this group of eight people around a table, admittedly the most powerful countries in the world, but why are they setting the agenda? Why are they saying we know best when it comes to things like development? And I think we do need to push for something that's much more democratic.</p><p></p><p>In 2009, we had, through the UN, a proposal to have a global economic council, for example. That was pushed back by the UK and the US in particular who weren't interested in that. And I think we do need to look for other places and more democratic, more legitimate processes that are happening.</p><p>And I'm particularly interested, for example, in La Via Campesina's international conference that is going to be happening at the same time as the G8, and there you'll have 500 small-scale farmers turning up from 70 different countries. I'm really interested in what they've got to say about how they think their economies should be structured so that they can produce and feed themselves.</p><p>And I think that on the climate change issue there's a huge lack of political leadership on this. I think whether or not your country is engaging in it, you know, we've just passed the four hundred parts per million – I mean that's terrifying isn't it? If I've understood the science right, that commits us to a two-degree change whatever we do now. And the G8 are saying nothing about it. That, to me, is absolutely terrifying and shows that they are the wrong people to be talking about these issues.</p><p></p><p><strong>LE </strong>It's not just the G8 though, is it? It's some of the bigger emerging market countries have got to live up to their responsibilities, too. China is a sort of semi-detached member of some of these bodies. It has enormous clout but it's not really using it in any constructive way, as far as I can see, in any of these big multinational negotiations.</p><p><strong>HM</strong> Isn't that why they need to be in the club?</p><p><strong>LE</strong> Well, they are in the club, they're in the G20 and they're pivotal to the Doha, they were pivotal to the Doha round of talks, they could have actually swung those talks one way or another. But a lot of the time they just decide to sit on the sidelines and actually let other people do the heavy lifting.</p><p>I agree that the G8 is an inadequate forum but some of the bigger developing countries need to actually live up to their responsibilities as well here.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>Larry, thanks. I've got to move on because we have a few more questions and we're running out of time a bit. A question from Laura Boughey</p><p><strong>Laura </strong>Hi. I'm Laura Boughey from Bond. And this touches on the debate that we've mentioned on the role of the private sector in aid, so I'd like to ask the panel: given public resistance to aid and falling public revenues, politicians are turning to private sector involvement. How clear are the panel on the risks of missing redistributive opportunities and poverty reduction targets in light of lessons learned about the short-termism of the private sector from the structural adjustment programmes of past decades?</p><p><strong>MH </strong>Justin, you've been doing things with GlaxoSmithKline so that might be a good one for you.</p><p><strong>JF </strong>I'm in the kind of camp on this which believes that the private sector has an enormous potential to do good, but also has a terrible track record in the past at different moments; we've just seen Bangladesh, for example, a terrible tragedy with more than 1,000 people killed. And so we should both engage with them and work with them but we should also challenge and criticise them. I used to picket GlaxoSmithKline's annual general meeting. When I was at Oxfam, we had a campaign around GlaxoSmithKline which tried to get press when they put Nelson Mandela back in the dock in South Africa on expensive aid drugs. But under Andrew Witty, under the changes that they've made in terms of what they're prioritising, they're now looking much more at how they harness their core business to do good.</p><p>And I think the reason we went into the partnership with GlaxoSmithKline, which I think is a challenge to other companies, is not about the bit of money they give us –it is important, but it's a small amount – but it's more about whether they harness their knowledge, expertise in core business. So, for instance, as part of our partnership launch they've transformed a mouthwash into a gel that stops babies dying from neonatal sepsis, which is an infection that occurs when you cut their umbilical cord which kills nearly up to a million children a year.</p><p></p><p>Now that's them using all of their capability to do something that will help reduce our millennium development goal four on child mortality, and that's a good thing. But we should go in with eyes wide open and we should challenge as well when they don't live up to what we want them to do, but we should also encourage.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>Jamie, can you do both of those things?</p><p><strong>JD </strong>Absolutely, yes. The idea is to get more investment that is a higher quality and more responsible adhering to rule of law and with strong institutions and checks and balances and a government that can keep an eye on things, that's the ideal. Whether countries have the capacity to manage the private sector and create the rules of the road and make sure that they adhere to the law is difficult, especially in resource-rich governance-weak countries, and I just want to talk about that for a second, because I just want to pick up on Larry being bit down about campaigners at the moment, he's wrong to be.</p><p><strong>LE </strong>But not you?</p><p><strong>JD </strong>Well, no because we've just been part of a fantastic campaign on Publish What You Pay that has, I think, in the process of achieving things that are potentially much bigger than what we did with \"Drop the Debt\" in terms of the natural resources of many developing countries that are going to be exploited right, there's no campaign that's going to successfully stop their exploitation. The Chinese, the Brazilians, the Indians want these resources, and by the way, so do the French and the Germans and the British and the Americans; and so do African citizens because they want to develop their economies and they need this investment. And they have the resources under the ground, and they're getting international investment in to exploit those resources and how that happens, how it is managed is the big story of our time. If those resources that are accrued are well invested in the transformation of their economies, we'll see a very different Sub-Saharan African inclusive growth trajectory over the next generation.</p><p></p><p>If it is not, you'll find entrenched further elites and mal-governance and mal-development of the sort that you've seen not well reflected in places like Nigeria. And it would be just an awful historic missed opportunity. The great news is, because of the bunch of campaigning that's happened in the last couple of years, there are laws in place, improving global governance norms about how the international, multinational resource exploitation companies have to behave. And, as those norms are being put in place through the London Stock Exchange and the New York stock exchange, we need to make sure that also covers the Johannesburg stock exchange, Accra, Nairobi and so on. And it has to go down to a national level in every developing country.</p><p></p><p>I just got back yesterday from Mozambique; in the next three years, $30bn is going to be invested in Mozambique to extract mainly gas and coal. And how that money is used or abused is the big story and all the anti-corruption campaigners are very worried about it, we need to help them.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>Thank you for that. I've just got just enough time to take one question from the floor?</p><p><strong>Hilary </strong>OK, thank you. My name's Hilary Burrage. One of the things that I'm very interested in is that we were talking about tax not being paid and there are many other avoidable economic mistakes, if you want to call it that – you know what I mean by that. For instance, harmful traditional practices which occur in many of the countries. We're talking about are not only humanitarian disasters – female genital mutilation; things like that are absolutely unspeakable – but also extremely expensive for the countries involved. To give you a concrete example, it is thought that a 2% increase in mortality probably arises from that particular instance and there are many others. And we all know from medical literature that for every 1% of children who die, generally speaking, another 10% are damaged.</p><p>So I want to know what are we doing to estimate the cost of this to economies because there are costs to economies as well as people, and what are we doing? It's much easier to stop in some ways than, say, malaria because if we could persuade people to stop, it stops, and that would actually benefit economies enormously.</p><p></p><p><strong>MH</strong> OK. Jamie, what can the G8 do about that?</p><p><strong>JD </strong>Sorry, are we talking about female genital mutilation?</p><p><strong>Hilary </strong>We're talking about the cost of traditional practices …</p><p><strong>HM </strong>How traditional practices are impacting on …</p><p><strong>Hilary </strong>… as in because they stop women being involved in economies …</p><p><strong>JD </strong>One very specific example which actually tees-off what Ruth was talking about agriculture; most small farmers in Africa are women and they don't have access to credit, government services or property rights. That is an egregious state of play and it's because of traditional, conservative customs and so on. There is a strong movement afoot to change that but it's certainly not something that's going to be changed by the G8. In fact, if we came wading in too heavily you could create all sorts of distortions in the way things could happen. There is a strong and growing movement of small farmers across Africa and they need to take this on and we need to help them build the capacity so they can take it on. We've been campaigning that the next year is the AU's year of agriculture. So the AU is celebrating this year the 50th anniversary of the AU. For the next year, it's the year of agriculture 10 years after the Maputo Declaration. We're campaigning to put women's rights and the rights of small farmers at the centre of the new strategy for agriculture for the next 10 years. And that would be one way of addressing some of what you're talking about.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>Justin, can the G8 hope to impact on something that's so internal to individual countries themselves?</p><p><strong>JF </strong>I don't think this is an issue for the G8 but I do think it is a big issue. And I think it's an interesting one and I know you've put it around a specific issue of female genital mutilation. But I think the whole issue around ideas and beliefs and how they reinforce poverty is a massive issue. If you were going to be honest, in India one of the two big causes of poverty are castes and attitudes towards girls and women, much more than many other government policies. So how do you change those ideas and beliefs?</p><p>It's the same in our own country; many of our attitudes in the past, whether it's to do with racism, attitudes to do with disability, to do with homosexuality – lots of different issues have held back different constituencies from being able to fulfil their potential. And I think sometimes development is a kind of ideas and beliefs in politics free zone. And we've got to put those kind of issues back into the debate. We're not just going to change things by being clever economists and anthropologists, we actually have to have politics, ideas and beliefs and this is a battle, one of the issues we're talking about is a battle of ideas and beliefs.</p><p><strong>MH </strong>There I have to wrap it up. I know you have other questions but it's been a stimulating debate – I hope you agree. Can I thank our audience and our panellists: Justin Forsyth, Jamie Drummond, Ruth Bergan and Larry Elliott. Give yourselves a round of applause.</p><p>We're hoping that some of the issues are a little clearer, and here's hoping that some of the key players listen in – yes that does mean you, Mr Cameron!

To recap:</p> <p>• <strong>The president defended drone warfare, saying not only is it the best option in many cases, it is morally preferable to the alternatives. </strong>&quot;Neither conventional military action, nor waiting for attacks to occur, offers moral safe-harbor,&quot; he said. He acknowledged that resentment of drone strikes creates new enemies but said other forms of warfare would too. </p> <p>• <strong>Obama announced he&apos;d signed a presidential guidance document Wednesday laying out &quot;clear guidelines, oversight and accountability&quot; for drone warfare.</strong> Congress is briefed on every drone strike, he said. The president said he had considered a special court to approve strikes, or a new oversight board within the executive branch. Both approaches present problems, he said.</p> <p><strong>• Obama admitted drone warfare had caused civilian casualties.</strong> &quot;For me, and those in my chain of command, these deaths will haunt us as long as we live,&quot; he said. He did not estimate how many civilians have been killed.</p> <p>• <strong>Obama said the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki was the only time the US had targeted a US citizen by drone (despite killing at least three others).</strong> Obama defended the action: &quot;As President, I would have been derelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took out Awlaki,&quot; he said. Obama said the rules in place for killing Americans apply &quot;to all potential terrorist targets.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• Obama called for more security at US diplomatic facilities,</strong> saying it&apos;s more dangerous to retreat from the world than to be out in it.</p> <p><strong>• The president called for an eventual end to the current, 12-year-old congressional authorization of the use of military force enabling what Bush called the &quot;global war on terror.&quot;</strong> &quot;This war, like all wars, must end,&quot; Obama said. &quot;That’s what history advises. That’s what our democracy demands.&quot;</p> <p><strong>• Obama said he was lifting a moratorium on the transfer of Guantanamo prisoners to Yemen.</strong> He called for the prison to be closed but said Congress stood in the way. &quot;There is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should never have been opened,&quot; he said. </p> <p>• <strong>Obama said Guantanamo prisoners who cannot be transferred abroad could be tried in US criminal courts or imprisoned in US super-max facilities.</strong> &quot;Our courts have convicted hundreds of people for terrorism-related offenses, including some who are more dangerous than most GTMO detainees,&quot; he said, but he didn&apos;t say what he&apos;d propose to do with prisoners who can&apos;t be released or tried, due to classification concerns, security concerns, the use of torture in interrogation and other factors. </p> <p>•<strong> The president was repeatedly interrupted by a protester calling on him to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay</strong>. Obama acknowledged that some prisoners are conducting a hunger strike. &quot;&quot;I&apos;m willing to cut the young lady who interrupted me some slack, because it&apos;s worth being passionate about,&quot; he said.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519e75eae4b0371c681fa08c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T21:02:51.024+01:00\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More <strong>reaction to the president&apos;s speech,</strong> via Dan Roberts.</p> <p>General Willian Nash, a veteran of Vietnam and Operation Desert Storm, and now an independent consultant on national security issues, zeroed in on Obama&apos;s stated desire to end the current congressional authorization for the use of military force. &quot;[Obama] has begun the transition from a perpetual war to a more normalised national security framework,&quot; Nash said.</p> <p>Elisa Massimino, president of Human Rights First, praised what the president had to say about the importance of the American ideal. &quot;We strongly welcome the statement that our values and ideals are our greatest asset,&quot; Massimino said. &quot;It is a slogan that we have a heard a lot but it is good to finally hear a strategy for how you get there.&quot;</p> <p>Incoming Guardian US national security correspondent Spencer Ackerman thought that for all the president&apos;s talk about closing Guantanamo, he didn&apos;t address the real sticking point:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/attackerman/status/337642375369334785\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Biggest copout in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23dronetanamo\">#dronetanamo</a> speech: What to do w detainees you 'can't' try or release?

That will help get the total at Guantanamo down to around 100.</p> <p>About 40 others will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. In the end, though, there are an estimated 60, most of them held in the supermax detention centre in Guantanamo, separate from the other prisoners. The US deems them to be too dangerous to release.</p> <p>Obama, while admitting he has no immediate solution to those in the supermax, suggested that they be dealt with by courts in the US just as other terrorists have been. </p> <p>The problem with this is that Congress will not agree to the transfer of these detainees to the mainland in any circumstances. Obama couched his appeal in terms of cash, saying Gitmo costs $150 million a year, roughly $1 million per detainee.

In sentencing Reid, Judge William Young told him, “the way we treat you…is the measure of our own liberties.” He went on to point to the American flag that flew in the courtroom – “That flag,” he said, “will fly there long after this is all forgotten.

Bush’s desperately premature ‘mission completed’ speech about Iraq in 2003.</p> <p>What Obama is saying is something different, something important. There has been scepticism from soon after the Long War that the phrase ‘war on terror’ or even ‘The Long War’ were overblown, turning al-Qaida into something bigger than it actually is.</p> <p>He wants in future a strategy that is “proportionate and smart”. Obama is downgrading the threat from overseas. Instead, the real danger is from home-grown terrorists, though often inspired by groups overseas. </p> <p>That means countering extremism and anti-US elements abroad. It means changing the message, with Obama repeating, as he has said before, the US is not at war with Islam.</p> <p>This is an important speech, marking a shift in the US attitude to terrorists, a repudiation of the Bush era wars.</p> <p>The problem with this new approach is that as long as he is pursuing a drones programme and Guantanamo remains open, he is going to continue to alienate many Muslims.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-519e667de4b0371c681fa080\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-23T19:57:01.845+01:00\">2.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The president falls silent as the protester (same one?)<strong> pipes up yet again.</strong></p> <p>Obama waits.

For the families of those civilians, no words or legal construct can justify their loss.

Here, at Fort McNair, Americans have served in uniform since 1791– standing guard in the early days of the Republic, and contemplating the future of warfare here in the 21st century.</p><p>For over two centuries, the United States has been bound together by founding documents that defined who we are as Americans, and served as our compass through every type of change. Matters of war and peace are no different. Americans are deeply ambivalent about war, but having fought for our independence, we know that a price must be paid for freedom. From the Civil War, to our struggle against fascism, and through the long, twilight struggle of the Cold War, battlefields have changed, and technology has evolved. But our commitment to Constitutional principles has weathered every war, and every war has come to an end.</p><p>With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, a new dawn of democracy took hold abroad, and a decade of peace and prosperity arrived at home. For a moment, it seemed the 21st century would be a tranquil time. Then, on September 11th 2001, we were shaken out of complacency. Thousands were taken from us, as clouds of fire, metal and ash descended upon a sun-filled morning. This was a different kind of war. No armies came to our shores, and our military was not the principal target. Instead, a group of terrorists came to kill as many civilians as they could.</p><p>And so our nation went to war. We have now been at war for well over a decade. I won't review the full history. What's clear is that we quickly drove al Qaeda out of Afghanistan, but then shifted our focus and began a new war in Iraq. This carried grave consequences for our fight against al Qaeda, our standing in the world, and – to this day – our interests in a vital region.</p><p>Meanwhile, we strengthened our defenses – hardening targets, tightening transportation security, and giving law enforcement new tools to prevent terror. Most of these changes were sound. Some caused inconvenience. But some, like expanded surveillance, raised difficult questions about the balance we strike between our interests in security and our values of privacy. And in some cases, I believe we compromised our basic values – by using torture to interrogate our enemies, and detaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of law.</p><p>After I took office, we stepped up the war against al Qaeda, but also sought to change its course. We relentlessly targeted al Qaeda's leadership. We ended the war in Iraq, and brought nearly 150,000 troops home. We pursued a new strategy in Afghanistan, and increased our training of Afghan forces. We unequivocally banned torture, affirmed our commitment to civilian courts, worked to align our policies with the rule of law, and expanded our consultations with Congress.</p><p>Today, Osama bin Laden is dead, and so are most of his top lieutenants. There have been no large-scale attacks on the United States, and our homeland is more secure. Fewer of our troops are in harm's way, and over the next 19 months they will continue to come home. Our alliances are strong, and so is our standing in the world. In sum, we are safer because of our efforts.</p><p>Now make no mistake: our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. We must recognize, however, that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. With a decade of experience to draw from, now is the time to ask ourselves hard questions – about the nature of today's threats, and how we should confront them.</p><p>These questions matter to every American. For over the last decade, our nation has spent well over a trillion dollars on war, exploding our deficits and constraining our ability to nation build here at home. Our service-members and their families have sacrificed far more on our behalf. Nearly 7,000 Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice. Many more have left a part of themselves on the battlefield, or brought the shadows of battle back home. From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions we are making will define the type of nation – and world – that we leave to our children. </p><p>So America is at a crossroads. We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us, mindful of James Madison's warning that \"No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.\" Neither I, nor any President, can promise the total defeat of terror. We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human beings, nor stamp out every danger to our open society. What we can do – what we must do – is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger, and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend. To define that strategy, we must make decisions based not on fear, but hard-earned wisdom. And that begins with understanding the threat we face.</p><p>Today, the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on a path to defeat. Their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us. They did not direct the attacks in Benghazi or Boston. They have not carried out a successful attack on our homeland since 9/11. Instead, what we've seen is the emergence of various al Qaeda affiliates. From Yemen to Iraq, from Somalia to North Africa, the threat today is more diffuse, with Al Qaeda's affiliate in the Arabian Peninsula – AQAP –the most active in plotting against our homeland. While none of AQAP's efforts approach the scale of 9/11 they have continued to plot acts of terror, like the attempt to blow up an airplane on Christmas Day in 2009.</p><p>Unrest in the Arab World has also allowed extremists to gain a foothold in countries like Libya and Syria. Here, too, there are differences from 9/11. In some cases, we confront state-sponsored networks like Hizbollah that engage in acts of terror to achieve political goals. Others are simply collections of local militias or extremists interested in seizing territory. While we are vigilant for signs that these groups may pose a transnational threat, most are focused on operating in the countries and regions where they are based. That means we will face more localized threats like those we saw in Benghazi, or at the BP oil facility in Algeria, in which local operatives – in loose affiliation with regional networks – launch periodic attacks against Western diplomats, companies, and other soft targets, or resort to kidnapping and other criminal enterprises to fund their operations.</p><p>Finally, we face a real threat from radicalized individuals here in the United States. Whether it's a shooter at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin; a plane flying into a building in Texas; or the extremists who killed 168 people at the Federal Building in Oklahoma City – America has confronted many forms of violent extremism in our time. Deranged or alienated individuals – often U.S. citizens or legal residents – can do enormous damage, particularly when inspired by larger notions of violent jihad. That pull towards extremism appears to have led to the shooting at Fort Hood, and the bombing of the Boston Marathon.</p><p>Lethal yet less capable al Qaeda affiliates. Threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad. Homegrown extremists. This is the future of terrorism. We must take these threats seriously, and do all that we can to confront them. But as we shape our response, we have to recognize that the scale of this threat closely resembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11. In the 1980s, we lost Americans to terrorism at our Embassy in Beirut; at our Marine Barracks in Lebanon; on a cruise ship at sea; at a disco in Berlin; and on Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie. In the 1990s, we lost Americans to terrorism at the World Trade Center; at our military facilities in Saudi Arabia; and at our Embassy in Kenya. These attacks were all deadly, and we learned that left unchecked, these threats can grow. But if dealt with smartly and proportionally, these threats need not rise to the level that we saw on the eve of 9/11.</p><p>Moreover, we must recognize that these threats don't arise in a vacuum. Most, though not all, of the terrorism we face is fueled by a common ideology – a belief by some extremists that Islam is in conflict with the United States and the West, and that violence against Western targets, including civilians, is justified in pursuit of a larger cause. Of course, this ideology is based on a lie, for the United States is not at war with Islam; and this ideology is rejected by the vast majority of Muslims, who are the most frequent victims of terrorist acts.</p><p>Nevertheless, this ideology persists, and in an age in which ideas and images can travel the globe in an instant, our response to terrorism cannot depend on military or law enforcement alone. We need all elements of national power to win a battle of wills and ideas. So let me discuss the components of such a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy. </p><p>First, we must finish the work of defeating al Qaeda and its associated forces.</p><p>In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for security. Our troops will come home. Our combat mission will come to an end. And we will work with the Afghan government to train security forces, and sustain a counter-terrorism force which ensures that al Qaeda can never again establish a safe-haven to launch attacks against us or our allies.</p><p>Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless 'global war on terror' – but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries. Thousands of Pakistani soldiers have lost their lives fighting extremists. In Yemen, we are supporting security forces that have reclaimed territory from AQAP. In Somalia, we helped a coalition of African nations push al Shabaab out of its strongholds. In Mali, we are providing military aid to a French-led intervention to push back al Qaeda in the Maghreb, and help the people of Mali reclaim their future.</p><p>Much of our best counter-terrorism cooperation results in the gathering and sharing of intelligence; the arrest and prosecution of terrorists. That's how a Somali terrorist apprehended off the coast of Yemen is now in prison in New York. That's how we worked with European allies to disrupt plots from Denmark to Germany to the United Kingdom. That's how intelligence collected with Saudi Arabia helped us stop a cargo plane from being blown up over the Atlantic.</p><p>But despite our strong preference for the detention and prosecution of terrorists, sometimes this approach is foreclosed. Al Qaeda and its affiliates try to gain a foothold in some of the most distant and unforgiving places on Earth. They take refuge in remote tribal regions. They hide in caves and walled compounds. They train in empty deserts and rugged mountains.</p><p>In some of these places – such as parts of Somalia and Yemen – the state has only the most tenuous reach into the territory. In other cases, the state lacks the capacity or will to take action. It is also not possible for America to simply deploy a team of Special Forces to capture every terrorist. And even when such an approach may be possible, there are places where it would pose profound risks to our troops and local civilians– where a terrorist compound cannot be breached without triggering a firefight with surrounding tribal communities that pose no threat to us, or when putting U.S. boots on the ground may trigger a major international crisis.</p><p>To put it another way, our operation in Pakistan against Osama bin Laden cannot be the norm. The risks in that case were immense; the likelihood of capture, although our preference, was remote given the certainty of resistance; the fact that we did not find ourselves confronted with civilian casualties, or embroiled in an extended firefight, was a testament to the meticulous planning and professionalism of our Special Forces – but also depended on some luck. And even then, the cost to our relationship with Pakistan – and the backlash among the Pakistani public over encroachment on their territory – was so severe that we are just now beginning to rebuild this important partnership.</p><p>It is in this context that the United States has taken lethal, targeted action against al Qaeda and its associated forces, including with remotely piloted aircraft commonly referred to as drones. As was true in previous armed conflicts, this new technology raises profound questions – about who is targeted, and why; about civilian casualties, and the risk of creating new enemies; about the legality of such strikes under U.S. and international law; about accountability and morality.</p><p>Let me address these questions. To begin with, our actions are effective. Don't take my word for it. In the intelligence gathered at bin Laden's compound, we found that he wrote, \"we could lose the reserves to the enemy's air strikes. We cannot fight air strikes with explosives.\" Other communications from al Qaeda operatives confirm this as well. Dozens of highly skilled al Qaeda commanders, trainers, bomb makers, and operatives have been taken off the battlefield. Plots have been disrupted that would have targeted international aviation, U.S. transit systems, European cities and our troops in Afghanistan. Simply put, these strikes have saved lives.</p><p>Moreover, America's actions are legal. We were attacked on 9/11. Within a week, Congress overwhelmingly authorized the use of force. Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces. We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first. So this is a just war – a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense.</p><p>And yet as our fight enters a new phase, America's legitimate claim of self-defense cannot be the end of the discussion. To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance. For the same human progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power – or risk abusing it. That's why, over the last four years, my Administration has worked vigorously to establish a framework that governs our use of force against terrorists – insisting upon clear guidelines, oversight and accountability that is now codified in Presidential Policy Guidance that I signed yesterday.</p><p>In the Afghan war theater, we must support our troops until the transition is complete at the end of 2014. That means we will continue to take strikes against high value al Qaeda targets, but also against forces that are massing to support attacks on coalition forces. However, by the end of 2014, we will no longer have the same need for force protection, and the progress we have made against core al Qaeda will reduce the need for unmanned strikes.</p><p>Beyond the Afghan theater, we only target al Qaeda and its associated forces. Even then, the use of drones is heavily constrained. America does not take strikes when we have the ability to capture individual terrorists - our preference is always to detain, interrogate, and prosecute them. America cannot take strikes wherever we choose – our actions are bound by consultations with partners, and respect for state sovereignty. America does not take strikes to punish individuals – we act against terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people, and when there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat. And before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured – the highest standard we can set.</p><p>This last point is critical, because much of the criticism about drone strikes – at home and abroad – understandably centers on reports of civilian casualties. There is a wide gap between U.S. assessments of such casualties, and non-governmental reports. Nevertheless, it is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties, a risk that exists in all wars. For the families of those civilians, no words or legal construct can justify their loss. For me, and those in my chain of command, these deaths will haunt us as long as we live, just as we are haunted by the civilian casualties that have occurred through conventional fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p><p>But as Commander-in-Chief, I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternatives. To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties – not just in our cities at home and facilities abroad, but also in the very places –like Sana'a and Kabul and Mogadishu – where terrorists seek a foothold. Let us remember that the terrorists we are after target civilians, and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes.</p><p>Where foreign governments cannot or will not effectively stop terrorism in their territory, the primary alternative to targeted, lethal action is the use of conventional military options. As I've said, even small Special Operations carry enormous risks. Conventional airpower or missiles are far less precise than drones, and likely to cause more civilian casualties and local outrage. And invasions of these territories lead us to be viewed as occupying armies; unleash a torrent of unintended consequences; are difficult to contain; and ultimately empower those who thrive on violent conflict. So it is false to assert that putting boots on the ground is less likely to result in civilian deaths, or to create enemies in the Muslim world. The result would be more U.S. deaths, more Blackhawks down, more confrontations with local populations, and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars.</p><p>So yes, the conflict with al Qaeda, like all armed conflict, invites tragedy. But by narrowly targeting our action against those who want to kill us, and not the people they hide among, we are choosing the course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life. Indeed, our efforts must also be measured against the history of putting American troops in distant lands among hostile populations. In Vietnam, hundreds of thousands of civilians died in a war where the boundaries of battle were blurred. In Iraq and Afghanistan, despite the courage and discipline of our troops, thousands of civilians have been killed. So neither conventional military action, nor waiting for attacks to occur, offers moral safe-harbor. Neither does a sole reliance on law enforcement in territories that have no functioning police or security services – and indeed, have no functioning law. </p><p>This is not to say that the risks are not real. Any U.S. military action in foreign lands risks creating more enemies, and impacts public opinion overseas. Our laws constrain the power of the President, even during wartime, and I have taken an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States. The very precision of drones strikes, and the necessary secrecy involved in such actions can end up shielding our government from the public scrutiny that a troop deployment invites. It can also lead a President and his team to view drone strikes as a cure-all for terrorism.</p><p>For this reason, I've insisted on strong oversight of all lethal action. After I took office, my Administration began briefing all strikes outside of Iraq and Afghanistan to the appropriate committees of Congress. Let me repeat that – not only did Congress authorize the use of force, it is briefed on every strike that America takes. That includes the one instance when we targeted an American citizen: Anwar Awlaki, the chief of external operations for AQAP.</p><p>This week, I authorized the declassification of this action, and the deaths of three other Americans in drone strikes, to facilitate transparency and debate on this issue, and to dismiss some of the more outlandish claims. For the record, I do not believe it would be constitutional for the government to target and kill any U.S. citizen – with a drone, or a shotgun – without due process. Nor should any President deploy armed drones over U.S. soil.</p><p>But when a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America – and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens; and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot – his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a swat team</p><p>That's who Anwar Awlaki was – he was continuously trying to kill people. He helped oversee the 2010 plot to detonate explosive devices on two U.S. bound cargo planes. He was involved in planning to blow up an airliner in 2009. When Farouk Abdulmutallab – the Christmas Day bomber – went to Yemen in 2009, Awlaki hosted him, approved his suicide operation, and helped him tape a martyrdom video to be shown after the attack. His last instructions were to blow up the airplane when it was over American soil. I would have detained and prosecuted Awlaki if we captured him before he carried out a plot. But we couldn't. And as President, I would have been derelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took out Awlaki.</p><p>Of course, the targeting of any Americans raises constitutional issues that are not present in other strikes – which is why my Administration submitted information about Awlaki to the Department of Justice months before Awlaki was killed, and briefed the Congress before this strike as well. But the high threshold that we have set for taking lethal action applies to all potential terrorist targets, regardless of whether or not they are American citizens. This threshold respects the inherent dignity of every human life. Alongside the decision to put our men and women in uniform in harm's way, the decision to use force against individuals or groups – even against a sworn enemy of the United States – is the hardest thing I do as President. But these decisions must be made, given my responsibility to protect the American people.</p><p>Going forward, I have asked my Administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of warzones that go beyond our reporting to Congress. Each option has virtues in theory, but poses difficulties in practice. For example, the establishment of a special court to evaluate and authorize lethal action has the benefit of bringing a third branch of government into the process, but raises serious constitutional issues about presidential and judicial authority. Another idea that's been suggested – the establishment of an independent oversight board in the executive branch – avoids those problems, but may introduce a layer of bureaucracy into national-security decision-making, without inspiring additional public confidence in the process. Despite these challenges, I look forward to actively engaging Congress to explore these – and other – options for increased oversight.</p><p>I believe, however, that the use of force must be seen as part of a larger discussion about a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy. Because for all the focus on the use of force, force alone cannot make us safe. We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root; and in the absence of a strategy that reduces the well-spring of extremism, a perpetual war – through drones or Special Forces or troop deployments – will prove self-defeating, and alter our country in troubling ways.</p><p>So the next element of our strategy involves addressing the underlying grievances and conflicts that feed extremism, from North Africa to South Asia. As we've learned this past decade, this is a vast and complex undertaking. We must be humble in our expectation that we can quickly resolve deep rooted problems like poverty and sectarian hatred. Moreover, no two countries are alike, and some will undergo chaotic change before things get better. But our security and values demand that we make the effort.</p><p>This means patiently supporting transitions to democracy in places like Egypt, Tunisia and Libya – because the peaceful realization of individual aspirations will serve as a rebuke to violent extremists. We must strengthen the opposition in Syria, while isolating extremist elements – because the end of a tyrant must not give way to the tyranny of terrorism. We are working to promote peace between Israelis and Palestinians – because it is right, and because such a peace could help reshape attitudes in the region. And we must help countries modernize economies, upgrade education, and encourage entrepreneurship – because American leadership has always been elevated by our ability to connect with peoples' hopes, and not simply their fears.</p><p>Success on these fronts requires sustained engagement, but it will also require resources. I know that foreign aid is one of the least popular expenditures – even though it amounts to less than one percent of the federal budget. But foreign assistance cannot be viewed as charity. It is fundamental to our national security, and any sensible long-term strategy to battle extremism. Moreover, foreign assistance is a tiny fraction of what we spend fighting wars that our assistance might ultimately prevent. For what we spent in a month in Iraq at the height of the war, we could be training security forces in Libya, maintaining peace agreements between Israel and its neighbors, feeding the hungry in Yemen, building schools in Pakistan, and creating reservoirs of goodwill that marginalize extremists.</p><p>America cannot carry out this work if we do not have diplomats serving in dangerous places. Over the past decade, we have strengthened security at our Embassies, and I am implementing every recommendation of the Accountability Review Board which found unacceptable failures in Benghazi. I have called on Congress to fully fund these efforts to bolster security, harden facilities, improve intelligence, and facilitate a quicker response time from our military if a crisis emerges.</p><p>But even after we take these steps, some irreducible risks to our diplomats will remain. This is the price of being the world's most powerful nation, particularly as a wave of change washes over the Arab World. And in balancing the trade-offs between security and active diplomacy, I firmly believe that any retreat from challenging regions will only increase the dangers we face in the long run. </p><p>Targeted action against terrorists. Effective partnerships. Diplomatic engagement and assistance. Through such a comprehensive strategy we can significantly reduce the chances of large scale attacks on the homeland and mitigate threats to Americans overseas. As we guard against dangers from abroad, however, we cannot neglect the daunting challenge of terrorism from within our borders.</p><p>As I said earlier, this threat is not new. But technology and the Internet increase its frequency and lethality. Today, a person can consume hateful propaganda, commit themselves to a violent agenda, and learn how to kill without leaving their home. To address this threat, two years ago my Administration did a comprehensive review, and engaged with law enforcement. The best way to prevent violent extremism is to work with the Muslim American community – which has consistently rejected terrorism – to identify signs of radicalization, and partner with law enforcement when an individual is drifting towards violence. And these partnerships can only work when we recognize that Muslims are a fundamental part of the American family. Indeed, the success of American Muslims, and our determination to guard against any encroachments on their civil liberties, is the ultimate rebuke to those who say we are at war with Islam.</p><p>Indeed, thwarting homegrown plots presents particular challenges in part because of our proud commitment to civil liberties for all who call America home. That's why, in the years to come, we will have to keep working hard to strike the appropriate balance between our need for security and preserving those freedoms that make us who we are. That means reviewing the authorities of law enforcement, so we can intercept new types of communication, and build in privacy protections to prevent abuse. That means that – even after Boston – we do not deport someone or throw someone in prison in the absence of evidence. That means putting careful constraints on the tools the government uses to protect sensitive information, such as the State Secrets doctrine. And that means finally having a strong Privacy and Civil Liberties Board to review those issues where our counter-terrorism efforts and our values may come into tension.</p><p>The Justice Department's investigation of national security leaks offers a recent example of the challenges involved in striking the right balance between our security and our open society. As Commander-in Chief, I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field. To do so, we must enforce consequences for those who break the law and breach their commitment to protect classified information. But a free press is also essential for our democracy. I am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable.</p><p>Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those who break the law. That is why I have called on Congress to pass a media shield law to guard against government over-reach. I have raised these issues with the Attorney General, who shares my concern. So he has agreed to review existing Department of Justice guidelines governing investigations that involve reporters, and will convene a group of media organizations to hear their concerns as part of that review. And I have directed the Attorney General to report back to me by July 12th.</p><p>All these issues remind us that the choices we make about war can impact – in sometimes unintended ways – the openness and freedom on which our way of life depends. And that is why I intend to engage Congress about the existing Authorization to Use Military Force, or AUMF, to determine how we can continue to fight terrorists without keeping America on a perpetual war-time footing.</p><p>The AUMF is now nearly twelve years old. The Afghan War is coming to an end. Core al Qaeda is a shell of its former self. Groups like AQAP must be dealt with, but in the years to come, not every collection of thugs that labels themselves al Qaeda will pose a credible threat to the United States. Unless we discipline our thinking and our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we don't need to fight, or continue to grant Presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states. So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMF's mandate. And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further. Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue. But this war, like all wars, must end. That's what history advises. That's what our democracy demands.</p><p>And that brings me to my final topic: the detention of terrorist suspects.</p><p>To repeat, as a matter of policy, the preference of the United States is to capture terrorist suspects. When we do detain a suspect, we interrogate them. And if the suspect can be prosecuted, we decide whether to try him in a civilian court or a Military Commission. During the past decade, the vast majority of those detained by our military were captured on the battlefield. In Iraq, we turned over thousands of prisoners as we ended the war. In Afghanistan, we have transitioned detention facilities to the Afghans, as part of the process of restoring Afghan sovereignty. So we bring law of war detention to an end, and we are committed to prosecuting terrorists whenever we can.</p><p>The glaring exception to this time-tested approach is the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. The original premise for opening GTMO – that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention – was found unconstitutional five years ago. In the meantime, GTMO has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law. Our allies won't cooperate with us if they think a terrorist will end up at GTMO. During a time of budget cuts, we spend $150 million each year to imprison 166 people –almost $1 million per prisoner. And the Department of Defense estimates that we must spend another $200 million to keep GTMO open at a time when we are cutting investments in education and research here at home.</p><p>As President, I have tried to close GTMO. I transferred 67 detainees to other countries before Congress imposed restrictions to effectively prevent us from either transferring detainees to other countries, or imprisoning them in the United States. These restrictions make no sense. After all, under President Bush, some 530 detainees were transferred from GTMO with Congress's support. When I ran for President the first time, John McCain supported closing GTMO. No person has ever escaped from one of our super-max or military prisons in the United States. Our courts have convicted hundreds of people for terrorism-related offenses, including some who are more dangerous than most GTMO detainees. Given my Administration's relentless pursuit of al Qaeda's leadership, there is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should never have been opened.</p><p>Today, I once again call on Congress to lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO. I have asked the Department of Defense to designate a site in the United States where we can hold military commissions. I am appointing a new, senior envoy at the State Department and Defense Department whose sole responsibility will be to achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries. I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, so we can review them on a case by case basis. To the greatest extent possible, we will transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries. Where appropriate, we will bring terrorists to justice in our courts and military justice system. And we will insist that judicial review be available for every detainee.</p><p>Even after we take these steps, one issue will remain: how to deal with those GTMO detainees who we know have participated in dangerous plots or attacks, but who cannot be prosecuted – for example because the evidence against them has been compromised or is inadmissible in a court of law. But once we commit to a process of closing GTMO, I am confident that this legacy problem can be resolved, consistent with our commitment to the rule of law. </p><p>I know the politics are hard. But history will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism, and those of us who fail to end it. Imagine a future – ten years from now, or twenty years from now – when the United States of America is still holding people who have been charged with no crime on a piece of land that is not a part of our country. Look at the current situation, where we are force-feeding detainees who are holding a hunger strike. Is that who we are? Is that something that our Founders foresaw? Is that the America we want to leave to our children?</p><p>Our sense of justice is stronger than that. We have prosecuted scores of terrorists in our courts. That includes Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up an airplane over Detroit; and Faisal Shahzad, who put a car bomb in Times Square. It is in a court of law that we will try Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of bombing the Boston Marathon. Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, is as we speak serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison here, in the United States. In sentencing Reid, Judge William Young told him, \"the way we treat you…is the measure of our own liberties.\" He went on to point to the American flag that flew in the courtroom – \"That flag,\" he said, \"will fly there long after this is all forgotten. That flag still stands for freedom.\"</p><p>America, we have faced down dangers far greater than al Qaeda. By staying true to the values of our founding, and by using our constitutional compass, we have overcome slavery and Civil War; fascism and communism. In just these last few years as President, I have watched the American people bounce back from painful recession, mass shootings, and natural disasters like the recent tornados that devastated Oklahoma. These events were heartbreaking; they shook our communities to the core. But because of the resilience of the American people, these events could not come close to breaking us.</p><p>I think of Lauren Manning, the 9/11 survivor who had severe burns over 80 percent of her body, who said, \"That's my reality. I put a Band-Aid on it, literally, and I move on.\"</p><p>I think of the New Yorkers who filled Times Square the day after an attempted car bomb as if nothing had happened.</p><p>I think of the proud Pakistani parents who, after their daughter was invited to the White House, wrote to us, \"we have raised an American Muslim daughter to dream big and never give up because it does pay off.\"<br /> <br />I think of the wounded warriors rebuilding their lives, and helping other vets to find jobs.<br /> <br />I think of the runner planning to do the 2014 Boston Marathon, who said, \"Next year, you are going to have more people than ever. Determination is not something to be messed with.\"</p><p>That's who the American people are. Determined, and not to be messed with.</p><p>Now, we need a strategy – and a politics –that reflects this resilient spirit. Our victory against terrorism won't be measured in a surrender ceremony on a battleship, or a statue being pulled to the ground. Victory will be measured in parents taking their kids to school; immigrants coming to our shores; fans taking in a ballgame; a veteran starting a business; a bustling city street. The quiet determination; that strength of character and bond of fellowship; that refutation of fear – that is both our sword and our shield. And long after the current messengers of hate have faded from the world's memory, alongside the brutal despots, deranged madmen, and ruthless demagogues who litter history – the flag of the United States will still wave from small-town cemeteries, to national monuments, to distant outposts abroad.  And that flag will still stand for freedom.</p><p>Thank you. God Bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/2/1362242666650/President-Barack-Obama-ha-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/23/obama-drones-guantanamo-speech-text","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/may/23/obama-drones-guantanamo-speech-text","sectionName":"US news"},{"webTitle":"Competition, not just collaboration, can push forward sustainability","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-23T15:43:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/competition-collaboration-push-forward-sustainability","fields":{"body":"<p>As Michael Porter, Peter Drucker and all the modern gurus of business literature agree, competition is the lifeblood of enterprise and business.  It is through clear competitive positioning, distinctiveness and astute management that the private sector creates economic value and growth.</p><h2>Competition driving sustainability</h2><p>This fundamental driver, the search for competitive advantage, produces fresh ideas and actions. It is through such innovation that the great breakthroughs in applied engineering and technology have been made. Think of Henry Ford, who sponsored the development of the assembly line in motor car production. Or, more recently, Steve Jobs's return to Apple in 1996, resulting in development of the iPhone and iPad, and moving the company from near-bankruptcy to become the one of the world's largest companies.</p><p>National competitive juices also drive some aspects of public policy.  For example, the race  between the US and USSR in the 1950s to put a man in space was eventually won by Russia when Yuri Gagarin circled the earth in 1961.</p><p>There is no shortage of examples of innovation driven by competitive juices leading to sustainable solutions. In product development, the early examples of Hindustan Unilever's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/dec/14/mini-pack-revolution-agricultural-development\" title=\"\">individually packaged soaps</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2007/mar/20/kenya.mobilephones\" title=\"\">Vodafone's M-Pesa</a> product to allow mobile phone banking in Kenya, sit with today's efforts by Standard Chartered to creating sustainable growth through access to finance, with products targeting SME and <a href=\"http://sustainability.standardchartered.com/contributing-to-the-real-economy/access-to-financial-services/microfinance.html\" title=\"\">micro-finance for the unbanked</a>.</p><p>In their supply chains several companies are working on innovative solutions to sustainable agriculture. Examples include Diageo and SAB Miller on <a href=\"http://www.sabmiller.com/index.asp?pageid=2358\" title=\"\">barley production</a> in Africa,  Nestlé on <a href=\"http://www.nestle.pk/aboutus/milkcollection\" title=\"\">milk supplies in Pakistan</a> or Cadbury's (now Kraft's) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/jan/28/cadburyschweppesbusiness\" title=\"\">Cocoa Partnership</a> to preserve vital supply chains in Ghana.</p><p>In the distribution chain Coca-Cola's <a href=\"http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/community/micro-distribution-centres.html\" title=\"\">micro-distribution centres</a> in Africa have developed new ways to employ local entrepreneurs to get their products \"the last mile\" to small urban and rural  outlets. Companies are also using innovative marketing to include their customers in their sustainability journeys. These include M&amp;S's <a href=\"http://plana.marksandspencer.com/\" title=\"\">Plan A </a>and Patagonia's <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/eu/enGB/common-threads\" title=\"\">Common Threads Partnership</a>.</p><p>While companies may be willing to share their initiatives outside the competitive context, for example, with NGOs and companies outside their sector, in almost every case, these models have been developed to improve the competitive positioning of each company, improve their brand value and increase quality and quantity of sales.</p><h2>Cross-sector collaborations</h2><p>On the other hand, we know that as the cost and complexity of scientific developments have increased, the necessity and  advantages of a collaborative approach have come to the fore, especially in experimental and research science.  The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/interactive/2008/jun/30/cernproject?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Large Hadron Collider</a> project involved more than 10,000 scientists and engineers from more than 100 countries working together towards a shared goal. Or the <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html\" title=\"\">International Space Station</a> project, where space agencies, scientists and astronauts from the US, Russia, Japan, Europe and Canada are uniting to work on what has been described as the most significant collaboration in modern history.</p><p>A third dimension on this debate, and one about which the <a href=\"http://www.iblf.org/about-IBLF.aspx\" title=\"\">International Business Leaders Forum</a> and its partnering initiative (TPI) knows a lot. It is the need for the various sectors of society to partner effectively to address the  challenges of achieving sustainable development.</p><p>No single sector has all of the answers. There is a pressing need for effective partnership between the private sector, with its access to financial, innovative and delivery resources; the government sector with the legitimacy and authority it brings; and civil society with local knowledge, trust credentials and local delivery capability. To get these disparate players to work effectively together in productive collaboration is no simple task.</p><h2>High stakes, high rewards</h2><p>So how are the great challenges to achieving a sustainable planet to be overcome? Through the drive, energy and consequent innovation of raw competition, through the efficient collaboration of the scientific and academic world, or through cross-sector partnerships with the principles of equity, transparency and mutual reward?</p><p>Inevitably, the answer probably involves a combination of all three. But don't be surprised if the private sector continually seeks to \"norm\" back to selfish competitive advantage in such interaction.  It's in its  blood. But at best it is the driving force for the kind of breakthrough innovation that we desperately need to get out of this unsustainable mess.</p><p>The trick is to preserve the best of the competitive energy and harness it to collaborative processes  to achieve scale and global impact beyond the reach even of the largest private sector enterprises.  To do this without killing the golden goose of competition and consequent innovation is the trick we need to play.</p><p>The stakes in this game are very high but so are the rewards: a sustainable planet where 9 billion people can live comfortably together. That surely is worth playing for?</p><p><em>Graham Baxter is </em><a href=\"http://www.iblf.org/en/about-IBLF/who-we-are/ourpeople/Graham_Baxter.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>senior adviser at IBLF</em></a></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Rwanda's president is famously direct with his critics. His contempt for governments he's crossed swords with, led by the French, is only marginally less vitriolic than his view of human-rights groups daring to lecture him, the rebel leader whose army put a stop to the 1994 genocide of 800,0000 Tutsis. But now even friends are regarded with suspicion to the point of hostility. Take London and Washington accusing Rwanda of perpetuating the interminable and bloody conflict across the border in Congo and flagging up concerns that Kagame is constructing a de-facto one-party state.</p><p>They are hypocrites, blind to their own histories, says Rwanda's president. \"Who are these gods who police others for their rights?\" he says in an interview with the <em>Observer</em> at the presidential office in Kigali. \"One of the things I live for is to challenge that. I grew up in a refugee camp. Thirty years. This so-called human-rights world didn't ask me what was happening for me to be there 30 years.\"</p><p>Nearly two decades after the leader of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) emerged from the hills to overthrow the extremist Hutu regime trying to exterminate the Tutsi population, Kagame is still a combative and divisive figure. To some he is the Lincoln of Africa for rising above his country's old divisions – and his own suffering after narrowly escaping as a child across the border to Uganda during an earlier bout of Tutsi killing – to preach forgiveness, reconciliation and hard work as he forges a new Rwanda out of the ashes of genocide.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430623441'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/5/17/1368788155752/Paul-Kagame-with-his-troo-008.jpg' alt='Paul Kagame with his troops in Rwanda' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The warrior: Paul Kagame with RPF troops in 1993, during the civil war that preceded the genocide. Photograph: Joel Stettenheim/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>To others, Kagame has exploited his country's tragic history, and the west's guilt over its inaction during the slaughter, to construct a new Tutsi-dominated authoritarian regime using the legacy of genocide to suppress opposition and cover up for the crimes of his own side. In doing so, critics warn, he is laying the groundwork for another bout of bloodletting down the road.</p><p>For years, the heroic view of Kagame prevailed, not least in Britain and the US which, between them, provided about half the money to fund the Rwandan government's budget. But, in recent months, there's been a very public shift. Once-unquestioning support from Washington, where Bill Clinton called Kagame \"one of the greatest leaders of our time\", has given way to cuts in military aid and warnings  from the US war crimes chief that Rwanda's leadership could find itself under investigation from the international criminal court over its backing for rebels in eastern Congo.</p><p>Britain, too, has stepped back from support so unequivocal that Clare Short, then Labour's international development secretary, called Kagame \"a sweetie\" and Tony Blair established a foundation to help the man he calls a \"visionary leader\" to govern. Britain's Conservative party has been no less enthusiastic. It set up a social-action project in Rwanda to bring hundreds of volunteers over recent years, including Tory MPs, to assist with construction of schools and community centres. Now the relationship is cooler as Congo's own tragedy, and Rwanda's part in it, can no longer be ignored.</p><p>A trail of imprisoned opponents, exiled former allies and assassinations pinned on Kagame by critics has also eaten away at his claims to be an enlightened, modernising leader who embraces new technology and is an enthusiastic blogger and tweeter. Among those locked up was Kagame's predecessor as president, Pasteur Bizimungu, while former allies from the RPF's days as a rebel army have fled abroad. They include Kagame's former chief aide, Theogene Rudasingwa, who formed a new political party with other exiles including former army chief of staff, General Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, who was wounded in an apparent assassination attempt in South Africa.</p><p>Another former ally, ex-interior minister Seth Sendashonga, who posed a serious political challenge after breaking with Kagame, was assassinated in Kenya 15 years ago. Rwanda's president has repeatedly denied any hand in the murder and several other apparently politically motivated killings since. But as a pattern of jailings, disappearances and deaths has developed there's no shortage of people ready to believe the worst.</p><p>Kagame increasingly takes a \"with us or against us\" view of even sympathetic criticism. The sharpness of his reaction suggests he was caught unawares by those he regarded as loyal friends deciding to keep a distance. He denies this. \"Nothing would catch me off guard because  I understand the world I live in. I understand it very well. And the world I live in is not necessarily a fair or just world. I have dealt with these injustices for the bigger part of my life,\" he says.</p><p>Part of what infuriates Kagame is what he sees as the age-old duplicity of neo-colonial powers. On the one hand politicians in western capitals are critical over democratic shortcomings in Rwanda. On the other, their diplomatic missions in Kigali praise Kagame for his single-minded, some say authoritarian, leadership in reconstructing his country and are wary of the day he leaves power.</p><p>Certainly, Rwanda is a better place than could have been imagined in the aftermath of the genocide. When Kagame's RPF rebels overthrew the Hutu extremist regime and seized power in 1994 they inherited a country dotted with mass graves and stripped of people. A sizeable proportion of the Hutu population fled across the borders to Zaire and Tanzania driven by fear, and a defeated Hutu leadership determined that Kagame should take over a \"country without a people\".</p><p>The Hutu army and its allied extremist militia, the interahamwe, were watered and fed in United Nations refugee camps even as they kept up the ethnic killings through cross-border raids. Kagame had few resources to draw on internally with many traditional institutions, such as the Catholic church, compromised by their part in the killings, including the involvement of priests and nuns in murder. Kagame's challenge was to reconstruct a country in which Tutsis could live without fear and the Hutu majority would accept him as its legitimate president.</p><p>A decade ago, one RPF regional military governor, Deo Nkusi, put it to me this way: \"Changing people here is like bending steel. The people were bent into one shape over 40 years and they have to be bent back. If we do it too fast we will just break them. We have to exert pressure gradually.\"</p><p>Kagame was austere and demanding. He lambasted Rwandans as lazy and urged discipline. That appeared to reflect a view that the moral degeneracy underpinning the genocide was in part a product of a population insufficiently dedicated to hard work. The president urged Rwandans to confront the past and then put it behind them. Faced with 150,000 alleged killers packed into jails, his government spurned colonial-era courts in favour of a traditional form of justice that provided a&nbsp;forum for confessions and pleas for forgiveness by the killers, and laid the ground for a degree of reconciliation.</p><p>But Kagame takes nothing for granted. He says the path to a new Rwanda is through economic and social development that produces politics without hate. \"The political, the economic, the social are tied together like the strands of a rope. The social and economic, if they are firm, tend to strengthen the other. In a state of poverty, illiteracy, people just remain exposed to all kinds of manipulation. That's what we have lived. It's easier to tell a poor person: you know what, you are poor, you're hungry because the other one has taken away your rights.\"</p><p>More than a million Rwandans have been lifted out of poverty since 2006. Access to healthcare and education is expanding. A construction boom has transformed the Kigali skyline. Kagame is also counting on time to solidify the gains. Two-thirds of Rwandans are under the age of 25 and open to a new way of thinking shaped by schools and learning the lessons of the past. But Kagame says he recognises that ridding Rwanda of the virus of hate and anger is not so simple.</p><p>\"The reality of it is that things don't just disappear,\" he says. He points to the children that grew up without families. \"It means they think about what created this situation where they have no families. So it's not just that they're growing up in a new situation and they have no bearing to the tragic past. Depending on how the situation continues to be managed, then the healing process – or the process of overcoming our past – becomes easier or more difficult.\" It is this achievement that has won Kagame previously unflinching support in many western capitals, even if it may be another generation before Rwandans can feel confident that, like Germany, they really have purged their past from their social fabric.</p><p>So it is  all the more baffling and frustrating to Paul Kagame that he finds himself being called to account for a situation he says is not of Rwanda's making and is really the responsibility of the very people pointing  the finger at him.</p><p>Rwanda's involvement in Congo has been undeniable since its 1996 invasion to clear the UN refugee camps used by Hutu extremists. The invasion evolved into a perpetual de-facto occupation in alliance with Congolese groups and the plunder of the region's considerable mineral resources by Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Security was an issue, but there was also money to be made.</p><p>Understanding for Rwanda's position eroded as eastern Congo fell under the control of warlords, and the people endured mass rape, massacres and starvation. Then, last year, a report by UN-appointed experts gave what it said was detailed evidence of the Rwandan military arming a mostly Tutsi rebel group in eastern Congo, M23, then led by a wanted war criminal, Bosco Ntaganda (who has since surrendered to the ICC).</p><p>Rwanda worked hard to discredit the report, but it triggered surprising reaction from those who had previously covered for Kagame. Washington said it found the UN research credible. The British also felt they could no longer turn a blind eye.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430623442'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/5/16/1368697568517/kigali-rwanda-008.jpg' alt='kigali, rwanda' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Facing the future: the changing skyline of the capital city, Kigali, now experiencing a period of economic growth.  Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>Kagame outright denies continuing Rwandan involvement in Congo and spends close to half an hour in a detailed explanation of why sending Rwandan troops there was  a good thing, how the UN report was the stitching together of rumour, speculation and lies, and why it is decades of Belgian, French and American involvement in that blighted country that is the real cause of its problems. \"I'm telling people look at themselves in the mirror. They are the ones responsible for problems  in Congo, not me,\" he says.</p><p>\"All the responsibilities that lie with the rest of the world, historically and in the present, have come to this: it is Rwanda responsible for all the problems. The Congolese themselves? No, not responsible for anything. Even the wasting of resources between Congo and the international community is something that has to be masked and packaged until Rwanda is made the problem.</p><p>\"You have a [UN peacekeeping] mission in Congo spending $1.5bn every year for the past 12 years. Nobody ever asks: what do we get out of this? From the best arithmetic, I would say: why don't you give half of this to the Congolese to build schools, to build roads, to give them water and pay these soldiers who rape people every day? I'd even pay them not to rape.\"</p><p>Kagame goes on the attack over claims by the US and UK at diplomatic meetings to have additional evidence of Rwandan assistance to M23. \"Up to this moment they've never given anybody a bit of what they're talking about – evidence,\" he says. The US froze military aid. Britain  suspended some financial support and then put in place new controls. Kagame regards Rwanda as the victim of a diplomatic lynch mob and accuses the British government of laying the groundwork by sending the BBC and Channel 4 News to file reports critical of Rwanda. \"It's just a circus. You start wondering about the people you're dealing with,\" he says.</p><p>The situation came to a head at a meeting between Kagame and ambassadors from the major foreign donors, including the UK and the US. I tell him I heard that diplomats had rarely seen him so furious. \"Yes. Probably  I was not angry enough. You can't have these people…\" He trails off. \"When you tell them the truth they think you are angry.\"</p><p>Part of what he says disturbs him is foreign governments cutting aid to the projects they have declared a success. What, he wonders, does that have to do with Congo? \"How does affecting aid help deal with those things they are complaining about? It's simple logic. It doesn't make sense,\" he says.</p><p>But then he decides it does make sense because the aid freeze was not about Congo at all. \"One thing that will never be said openly, but is a fact, aid is also a tool of control. It's not completely altruistic,\" he says. \"If a country's giving us aid it doesn't give them the right to control us. I mean it. I can say thank you, you are really helpful. But you don't own me.\"</p><p>Kagame's anger rises again at what he says is western donors' insistence on talking about an issue he regards as having nothing to do with aid. \"They say: these Rwandans think they are free, but actually they are not free. Sometimes it becomes a laughable matter, honestly.\" As with almost everything else in Rwanda, issues of freedom are bound up with the legacy of genocide. Kagame's critics say he is using laws intended to prevent the propagation of the kind of hate speech that contributed to the killings to suppress criticism of, and opposition to, the government. For some, the cause célèbre concerns Victoire Ingabire, leader of the Unified Democratic Forces, a coalition mostly of exiles, who attempted to challenge Kagame in the 2010 presidential election. She was arrested before the vote and subsequently sentenced to eight years in prison for inciting revolt, genocide ideology and forming  an armed group.</p><p>Her supporters dismiss the charges as trumped up and hail her as a Rwandan version of Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader. Foreign human rights groups have raised concerns about freedom of speech and the conduct of the trial after the principal  witnesses against Ingabire were held incommunicado and possibly tortured into providing testimony.</p><p>But Ingabire's case also reflects the complexities of talking about the past in a country living with the legacy of genocide. On returning from 15 years' living in the Netherlands, Ingabire gave a speech at Kigali's genocide memorial, where thousands of victims are buried, equating the deaths of Hutus in the civil war with the murder of 800,000 Tutsis during the extermination campaign: \"If we look at this memorial, it only refers to the people who died during the genocide against the Tutsis. There is another untold story with regard to the crimes against humanity committed against the Hutus. The Hutus who lost their loved ones are also suffering; they think about the loved ones who perished and are wondering, 'When will our dead ones also be remembered?'\"</p><p>Tutsi survivors were outraged not only by the implication in her statements of a \"double genocide\", which they saw as intended to diminish the organised killings, but the choice of location at which to make the comments.</p><p>Ingabire's history casts doubt on her claim to have merely raised a legitimate issue for discussion. She is president of the Republican Rally for Democracy in Rwanda, a group  born in the Hutu refugee camps in the mid-1990s with the backing of the politicians  and army officers who carried out the genocide and who have spent the years since attempting to rewrite history.</p><p>Kagame points to the bans on Holocaust denial in France and Germany as evidence that foreign criticism over Ingabire's case  is western hypocrisy. \"The same people  who have those laws (banning Holocaust denial) are saying we shouldn't have them. We're not blind to this,\" he says.</p><p>However, Ingabire's case does point up the limits on discussing what many Rwandans think are legitimate issues. Gonzaga Muganwa, a journalist and presenter of a&nbsp;radio phone-in, watched Ingabire's speech at the memorial. \"We were so shocked. Nobody has heard such words spoken on Rwandan soil since the genocide,\" he says. \"I myself wrote a&nbsp;piece saying Ingabire should be prosecuted. It's like saying Churchill bombing Dresden was the same as the Holocaust. The Tutsi genocide was an attempt to exterminate them.\" But Muganwa does have problems with restrictions on freedom of speech. He shakes his head over the case of two journalists jailed for genocide denial, divisionism and insulting Kagame. Rwanda's supreme court overturned the genocide-related convictions, but upheld those for defaming the president and public disorder. \"Defaming the president should not be a criminal offence,\" says Muganwa.</p><p>He also confirms what other Rwandan journalists say: that they self-censor. Muganwa decided to look at the facts behind an issue widely if quietly discussed – a belief that a&nbsp;younger generation of Rwandans appointed to senior administrative positions in the government are mostly Tutsis who grew up in exile in neighbouring English-speaking Uganda, the same as many in the RPF leadership. It's a sensitive issue not only because it feeds into old Hutu extremist accusations of \"Tutsi domination\" but because of unhappiness at Tutsi exiles prospering while the genocide survivors still struggle in poverty.</p><p>\"When I did my research I found that most of those people tended to speak English and some had family connections,\" says Muganwa. \"I stopped because I know I would have been accused of creating divisions. I&nbsp;would have been open to prosecution. It's a&nbsp;no-go area. People discuss it in bars all the time, but you can't print it.\"</p><p>Muganwa goes on to raise the case of Frank Habineza and his Democratic Green Party of Rwanda. \"I ask myself why the government refuses to register the Green party,\" he says.</p><p>As a former member of the RPF who broke with Kagame, no one could accuse Habineza of promoting genocide ideology. In 2010  he attempted to register the Greens for the presidential election, but fled the country after his party's vice president was found with his head cut off. Now he's back fighting what he believes is a deliberate government strategy to prevent him organising.</p><p>\"It has not been easy. This government is lacking in recognition of political rights,\" he says. \"You will not find anything divisive in what we've done, what we've said. The only thing we want is democracy, that people are consulted. We have a tendency here where the authorities just make a decision and hand it down to the people. Kagame is more interested in maintaining power and he will do anything to stay in power no matter what type of problems he leaves us with.\"</p><p>Kagame's response is to suggest that the concerns are all foreign inspired. \"We really need to decide for ourselves, not what people on the outside decide for us,\" he says. \"In terms of our internal political context, we manage it as our affairs. And the outsiders keep bringing in all kinds of poisons; we deal with that as well. But we have to deal with our lives as we deal with them, and keep managing those that come from outside as best we can to deal with it. And even tell them what they don't like to hear – that they bring prejudice and double standards in our own situation.\"</p><p>this raises the question of 2017. Rwanda's constitution requires Kagame to step down in four years, but already there are rumblings about changing it to allow him to stay on as president. Some of this is generated by the sycophancy expected of underlings wishing to remain in their leader's good graces, but there are other, unusual, forces at work as well.</p><p>A fair number of genocide survivors fear the day Kagame relinquishes power, believing his strong hand is all that keeps another bout of ethnic bloodletting at bay. There are also Hutus wary of political change because they see Rwanda's president as keeping a&nbsp;lid on violent Tutsi retaliation for the genocide. Others, including Kagame's own justice minister, believe it is essential for Kagame to step down in 2017 in order to maintain the primacy of the rule of law.</p><p>Kagame has been equivocal in the past, but greets the news of his justice minister's views with belligerence. \"Why don't you tell him to step down himself? All those years he's been there, he's not the only one who can be the justice minister,\" he says. \"In the end we should come to a view that serves us all. But in the first place I wonder why it becomes the subject of heated debate.\"</p><p>One of the reasons is that Rwandans are not alone in wondering if the final decision will really be the product of political consensus or, like so much else, ultimately decided by Kagame himself. Foreign governments have one eye on what they now regard as the salutary experience of dealing with Yoweri Museveni, president of neighbouring Uganda.</p><p>Two decades ago Museveni was hailed as one of a \"new breed\" of African leaders who broke with the plundering \"presidents for life\" and promised an era of good governance and freedoms. Museveni delivered to some extent, but there's no more talk of the new breed as Uganda's president heads toward his 30th year in power with little sign of political opponents being allowed to challenge him. When I tell Kagame there is a suspicion in some foreign capitals that he is treading in the footsteps of Museveni – a man regarded by some in the west as having betrayed his commitment  to democracy – Rwanda's president returns  to his favoured theme.</p><p>\"Who are they, first of all, to feel betrayed? They are not gods. They don't create people. They don't own people. This whole thing of saying betrayed – betrayed by what?\" he says.</p><p>Kagame wonders whether anybody ever accuses the Liberal Democratic party of Japan, which has ruled almost continuously since 1955, of clinging on to power. \"I'm sure if the RPF went on for 40 years it would be a&nbsp;crime, but for the Liberal party in Japan it's not a crime. This is what disturbs me. Sometimes you feel like doing things just to challenge that – that somebody is entitled to do something, but says when you do it you are wrong. I find it bizarre,\" he says. \"If it happens elsewhere and people think it's OK, why do people say it's not OK when it happens in Rwanda? I&nbsp;just don't accept this sort of thing. We have many struggles to keep fighting. Some of the things are like racism: 'These are Africans, we must herd them like cows.' No! Just refuse it.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/5/16/1368697261630/Bill-Clinton-in-Rwanda-wi-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/19/kagame-africa-rwanda","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/may/19/kagame-africa-rwanda","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Guardian News &amp; Media press release: Observer Ethical Awards announce shortlist for 2013","webPublicationDate":"2013-05-16T08:49:00Z","sectionId":"gnm-press-office","id":"gnm-press-office/observer-ethical-awards-announce-shortlist-for-2013","fields":{"body":"<p>Today we announce the people, places and businesses that have won over a stellar list of judges to become finalists in the eighth Observer Ethical Awards, in association with Ecover.

Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and even Google Docs have been used in unprecedented ways this time around – both for coordination, and for disseminating news\". By 11 February 2011, Hosni Mubarak had resigned and observers began to speak of a \"<a href=\"http://www.policymic.com/articles/10642/twitter-revolution-how-the-arab-spring-was-helped-by-social-media\" title=\"\">Twitter revolution</a>.\"</p><p>While many disagree about the exact role social media played in what has become known as 'the Arab Spring', there is no denying that the internet has changed the way networks form and how those networks then challenge established structures.</p><p>In a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_cellphones_twitter_facebook_can_make_history.html\" title=\"\">Ted talk on 'How social media can make history'</a>, New York University academic, Clay Shirky argues that \"the history of the modern world could be rendered as the history of ways of arguing, where changes in media change what sort of arguments are possible – with deep social and political implications\". His <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/speakers/clay_shirky.html\" title=\"\">biography on the site</a> describes his work as follows: \"Clay Shirky's work focuses on the rising usefulness of networks ... New technologies are enabling new kinds of cooperative structures to flourish as a way of getting things done in business, science, the arts and elsewhere as an alternative to centralised and institutional structures\".</p><p>So how does that play out in development? How can social media change how development research is shared and used?  How too can social media change the way activists and NGOs campaign?
