The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has been gradually letting out of the doghouse dozens of violent \"video nasties\" that were considered too ghastly for the delicate sensibilities of the public decades ago, and now seem acceptable. As Sue Clark of the BBFC explained this week, \"Times shift, attitudes change, and what was then problematic is not problematic now. In today's current climate we do not consider these films to be a concern.\"</p><p>Does that mean that Britons have hardened, grown blithe about butchery? Is this cause for alarm? Numerous MPs seem to think so. Backed by Keith Vaz, head of the Commons home affairs committee, and with cross-party support from other MPs, the Conservative MP for Canterbury Julian Brazier is introducing a private member's bill to make it easier to challenge the BBFC's permissiveness and get icky films re-banned. Ergo, in one of the rare instances where a British authority has actually loosened its grip on the micromanaging of the nation's personal lives, parliament's immediate response is to tighten the screws right back down. What a shock.</p><p>Another route beckons. Considering that tastes are fickle, and subject to the change that the BBFC acknowledges; considering that social consensus on what constitutes \"unacceptable\" violence or sexual explicitness is a myth - what is grotesque to one person may be simply comical to another; considering that we can all exercise private censorship by controlling what we do and do not watch; and considering that no horror film, no matter how grisly, can out-gross the evening news - is it not time to ban the banners? Surely true embrace of modernity would eliminate the BBFC altogether, and thus give Britons over the age of 18 credit for being grown-ups.</p><p>By conceit, British tastes have changed - coarsened, so goes the pro-censorship argument, perhaps as a very result of being overexposed to slice-and-dice. Yet a handful of bureaucrats cannot possibly stand in for the multitudes, the 60 million people who span the gamut from Sikh grandmothers to hip media studies students who grew up playing Dark Messiah: Might and Magic on their computers.</p><p>Disclaimer: I may have grown up watching the All-Night Horror Spectaculars that ran on North Carolina's Channel 5 on Friday nights, but these comprised Boris Karloff fare - tame stuff, and blood was hard to distinguish from Indian ink in the old black-and-whites. Since then, I've not kept up with horror films per se, though violence is hardly exclusive to the genre. So I've seen my share of gore - in Seven or Braveheart. On the yuck scale, I'd place myself in the middle. I can stick a variety of special effects (severed heads sailing through the air - yawn), and I'm bored by ketchup. On the other hand, I can't bear to watch dental torture, and I'm quixotically phobic about needles.</p><p>For our purposes here, my greatest claim to authority is having now survived six films back to back, all recently unbanned by Britain's benevolent overseers; the exercise was something like those Friday-night marathons when I was 10. And let me tell you, these films are crap. They are not just horror films; they are horrible films. But if I am the guinea pig, the question is: have I now been irretrievably coarsened?</p><p>In the wake of Holocaust memorial day, the newly declassified film that has raised the most hackles is the 1970s' SS Experiment Love Camp, a low-budget excuse to parade a dozen naked women before the camera. At a camp for Mengele-style medical experimentation, lithe young ladies are scalded, frozen, electrocuted and incinerated. They're made to have sex with the male officers (and, of course, the head nurse is a lesbian), and naturally come to like it. The Good Nazi falls in love with one of the prisoners, but it's just his luck that his commandant, maimed by another prisoner who bit his testicles off, has the Good Nazi's transplanted to himself. The transplant surgery scene is disagreeable, but no more so than an episode of ER.</p><p>The research was, uh, weak. Real starving inmates didn't shave their pubic hair or wear much makeup. The dinner scenes with pleasant jam sandwiches and hard-cooked eggs don't square with what I've read about the Holocaust.</p><p>Granted, a T&amp;A flick set in a Nazi concentration camp is conceptually tasteless, and offensive - to Gypsies and homosexuals and to Jews most of all. But Love Camp isn't pornographic - and sexually pornographic films with a Holocaust backdrop do exist. It even crams in the odd line of moralising: \"All these people being sacrificed!\" cries the Good Nazi. \"It seems so inhuman!\"</p><p>Interestingly, the film is expressly set in a camp for political prisoners. Aside from Dr Abraham, the surgeon forced to collaborate, none of the inmates is portrayed as Jewish. Invective from guards runs to \"Filthy pig whore!\"; Jewishness is never alluded to. Taking a film such as this seriously is a mistake. If this cheesy offering trivialises the Holocaust, one could make the case that ultimately any mere film is trivial in comparison to the real thing. Should the test be truly doing justice to the magnitude of this historical atrocity, then we would have to ban not only SS Experiment Love Camp but also Schindler's List.</p><p>I Spit on Your Grave takes the Oscar for Lamest Picture Ever Banned. A young woman takes a cabin in the country to work on her first novel. Sunning herself in the obligatory bikini, she is kidnapped by yokels and gang-raped; there's much snuffling and grunting with bums in the air, but the sex isn't explicit. Thereafter, she avenges herself on the rapists, and it suits the film-makers that she seduces each one (more sex) before murdering him. One she hangs by the neck; another she parts from the bit boys love best, albeit in the bath, and all we see is the water turning orange. (Yes, orange. Proper ketchup must have been in short supply.) The next gets an axe in the back, and there's one close-up of the blade sinking into what looks like an underbaked loaf of bread. The last two she runs over with a motorboat, but again there are no stumps floating in the lake; the water simply turns the same dubious shade of orange.</p><p>Naturally, the film's quasi-feminist message of female empowerment is merely an excuse for prurience; the poor girl can't ever whack anybody without her top off. Nevertheless, this dorky, pale and excruciatingly slow film is no more violent than a hangnail. The mystery is not why it has finally been given a certificate, but why it was ever censored in the first place. What a fitting institutional punishment for their past alarmism, then, that the current members of the BBFC were forced to watch it, presumably in order to reverse its ban of this sad excuse for cinema.</p><p>Likewise no longer of \"concern\" is Driller Killer. An artist gets an unusually high phone bill, and you know how that can set you off. After seeing an advert for Porto-Pak power tools on TV, the painter starts goring vagrants with an electric drill (thank heavens for rechargeable batteries). There's a fair amount of burbling red stuff, although attacks to the torso are all through clothing. Variations prove limited - a little crucifixion scene involving a drunk, another scene where the drill goes through the safety glass of a bus shelter (a very hardy drill, this) into a waiting passenger's back, but the only truly horrifying parts of the film are its ceaseless pans of a really bad painting.</p><p>And check this out for brutality: the painter's agent finally sees said painting and explodes: \"You're becoming simply a technician! No passion! This is a work of pure, unadulterated ego! Worthless!\" Well, nobody wants an agent who's not supportive. So the unappreciative rep gets it straight through the heart - though we never see the drill bit strike home. So: violent, no; but annoying, yes, since the film's constant hoooo-er! hoooo-er! soundtrack of a revving drill perfectly replicates late-night DIY next door.</p><p>It was a challenge to discern what exactly in Faces of Death 2 was ever supposed to have queasied the British stomach. Perhaps the fear ran that anyone who ever watched the whole thing from start to finish would shoot themselves, in which case that concern remains valid today. This droning, incoherent documentary about death - just death, of any description, including of mice - strings together a hotchpotch montage of funeral rites from around the world; an explanation of the different ways that people can die (burning, freezing and boxing); news reports (a rebel attack in El Salvador, cluster-bomb victims in Lebanon, nuclear testing in the 1950s); segments on animal testing and drink driving; one cops-and-robbers shoot-out; a really long elegy about pollution that impressively manages to seem irrelevant even to this line-up; a whaling expedition; pictures of tropical diseases; and the autopsy of a man who had colon cancer.</p><p>I finally figured out why it was banned to begin with. It was that footage from Lebanon. The cluster-bomb victims. They had lost not only limbs but chunks of shoulder, half a head ... The only thing that made the clip bearable was its dated video technology, so the colour was bleached, the focus poor.</p><p>Which brings us to a problem. The average Dispatches documentary is more violent than any of the films I have just watched, and the programme that the BBFC really needs to ban first and foremost is the evening news. The packages out of Kenya this past week were far gorier than Driller Killer, with their close-ups of oozing, amazingly life-like machete wounds, bulging contusions, and corpses in the road. Is that coarsening? I should say.</p><p>Predating A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Last House on the Left is an early Wes Craven film, and the fact that is was ever banned is interesting. The film uses the same revenge model as I Spit on Your Grave: two girls off to a rock concert are kidnapped by escaped convicts, raped and killed - one stabbed, the other shot. When the convicts impose on the hospitality of one of the dead teens' parents, Mum and Dad avenge their daughter's murder. Why is its previous banning interesting? Craven showed some talent even this early in his career, and The Last House on the Left includes a few segments of genuinely well-crafted horror. One scene is outstanding: a dream sequence in which the father, dressed as a dentist, leans over a baddie whose mouth is open. Dad places a chisel right at the point the convict's two front teeth meet the gum, and his wife brings a hammer down on the chisel.</p><p>Why is this good horror? Because the dream cuts off; you never see the teeth chiselled off at the gum. The violence only happens in your head. A gifted horror director knows well that he can never film worse than you can imagine. Accordingly, Last House goes easy on the ketchup, and even in the final scene, where Dad whacks the ringleader with a chainsaw, the carnage happens offcamera. The violence that the censors wished to ban was in their minds.</p><p>Cannibal Holocaust is, admittedly, creepy. Four documentary film-makers go on an expedition to South America to investigate short, badly dressed \"tree people\" with a hygiene problem. The journalists don't ingratiate themselves, and end up coming for dinner as the main course. Numerous scenes involve dismembered human corpses being pulled apart, gnawed and eviscerated. But what is odd about these scenes is that they are only revolting because the animals being slaughtered are human beings. That is, when a tree person raises a heart and liver victoriously in the air, the organs resemble the very same innards that we can buy in the supermarket - without the clingfilm. I am not a vegetarian. But since it makes the connection between living creature and shepherd's pie, Cannibal Holocaust is squirm-inducing about eating meat of any kind. On occasion I idle past the lamb section at Tesco and imagine what a gruesome scene this would seem - what a horror film it would make - if I were a sheep.</p><p>Hilariously, the anthropologist in Cannibal Holocaust who brings the film material of this ill-fated expedition back to \"civilisation\" actually makes the case for the BBFC. Television producers in New York are determined to air the cannibalism footage: \"Today people want sensationalism. The more you rape their senses, the more they want!\" But once the producers view the full footage, the top exec exclaims: \"John - I want this material burned! All of it!\" The public cannot have its unseemly appetites fed. Cannibal Holocaust gleefully makes the case for banning itself, yet coyly deploys its censorship to its advantage. Just as many of these films use having been banned as a commercial come-on, the case of Cannibal Holocaust boasts that it has been \"banned in 50 countries\". By designating films taboo, the BBFC does their PR work for them.</p><p>What exactly is the BBFC protecting the nation from? After all, anyone who picks up The Gestapo's Last Orgy - still banned - is not expecting a sequel to The Lion King. Britons might be trusted to know their own tastes. Folks who don't care to watch short people eat human livers don't have to. But are those that do unwittingly numbed into brutes?</p><p>The BBFC is surely right, of course, that broadly western audiences have become more inured to violent special effects. With squeamish exceptions, we no longer hide behind the sofa every time a character gets knifed. But I would argue that we have grown blase about violence in the movies, which is a far cry from having grown blase about violence in real life. We are more accustomed now to clever and increasingly vivid representations of all the slings and arrows that flesh is heir to. But that's because we know it's fake. We have internalised the realisation that it is fake. We have learned to distance ourselves from skilful artifice.</p><p>Yet the very same people who sit calmly snacking on popcorn through decapitations in feature films are still going to be sickened if they watch Kenneth Bigley decapitated on a real-life video from Iraq. They are still going to be anguished by car accidents they pass on the motorway. If someone kills themself by plunging 20 storeys to land in a splat at their feet, they are not going to chortle and ask for another sip of soda. They are still going to be stricken if a family member swoons out of the kitchen having just sliced off half a finger.</p><p>What the BBFC wishes to protect is not our concern for others, but our artistic naivety. They are not safeguarding our humanity, but our susceptibility to illusion.</p><p><strong>&middot; </strong>Lionel Shriver's latest novel is The Post-Birthday World (HarperCollins 2007).</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> This article was amended on Monday February 4 2008.

But for the last few years, authoritarian government, deriding institutions such as a free media, an independent judiciary and trade unions, has made a comeback. From Russia to Venezuela, Kenya to Iran, such notions have been tarred with the brush of being Western, colonial and an obstacle to strong executive government so vital for economic development.</p><p>If the response to the invasion of Iraq has given those sceptical of democracy ample ammunition, they have another tonic in the emergence of China, a model of what apparently can be achieved in a democracy-free environment. The Communist party loses no opportunity to remind us of its virtues. It was no surprise that when Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki clung to power, it prompted mass rioting and more than 500 deaths. China's People's Daily declared the whole affair was proof that Western 'democracy' should not and could not be transplanted into non-Western societies.</p><p>China's official state newspaper argued that Africa had once possessed Chinese-style 'consultative democracy' (i.e. one party or tribal rule that 'consults' its peoples while retaining a monopoly of power), and it was the imperialists who had swept it to one side. Africa should revert to its precolonial traditions and not trouble with such trifles as holding governments to account via elections, freedom of expression and encouraging a plurality of private and public power as a counterbalance to the state. Such ideas had no place in Africa, Asia and China, Messrs Putin, Ch&aacute;vez, Ahmadinejad and Kibaki would doubtless agree.</p><p>Re-establishing the case for democracy after the Blair/Bush excesses is one of the most important jobs of our time and it makes relationships with China particularly delicate. It is not just that tough international censure of odious regimes and flagrant abuse of human rights is severely cramped by China's attitude, it undermines the fragile but imperative 'soft' infrastructure of democratic institutions both nationally and internationally that are vital to wealth generation and international good governance. For example, any workable global system to tackle climate change needs an accompanying framework of independent policing, accountability, penalties and redress - core democratic principles. But if a critical mass of countries sees such processes as a Trojan horse for Western democracy, such a system is stillborn.</p><p>Yet these word have not passed Gordon Brown's lips during his China visit, nor any of the accompanying nabobs of British business. They are bewitched by the China dream - the emergence of a market of 1.3 billion new consumers. Unlike French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who dared to discuss such issues when in Beijing, or Chancellor Angela Merkel, who welcomed Tibet's Dalai Lama in Germany and incurred China's wrath, Mr Brown reserves his campaigns for democracy to small fry such as Zimbabwe's Mr Mugabe.</p><p>He is right to preach the benefits of trade, but that does not mean we should strike a one-sided bargain with China. Brown wants Britain to become the number one investment destination of China's $200bn sovereign wealth fund, so opening up the prospect of British companies becoming nationalised by the Chinese. This would require us to accept Chinese assurances that the sovereign wealth fund and its actions will be transparent. This is a constitutional and political impossibility; the Chinese state is constructed upon non-transparency and non-accountability.</p><p>Equally, we have made no challenge to China's manipulation of its exchange rate, routine theft of intellectual property, hacking into UK government computer systems or the spectacular breaching of targets for greenhouse gas emissions because of energy inefficiency. We have not challenged its imprisonment of trade unionists and journalists, its censorship of the internet or sought better protections that its products will not poison us. When it comes to principles, we have run up the white flag to double trade in three years, a doubling that, because we have so little China wants to buy, implies an even larger British trade deficit.</p><p>Nobody is arguing that China's regime would change overnight if Brown expressed concerns over its authoritarianism, but Sarkozy, Merkel and even Bush managed to and still won big trade deals. China needs access to Western markets, technology and processes and understands power realities; the right approach is to combine Brown's carrot of openness with some stick in the form of conditions. Not to do so is to repudiate what little leverage we have and to make the same dubious bet as the Communist party, that China's continued economic growth is possible without democracy, impartial law, accountability and transparency. It is a bet already showing signs of failing. Worse, it is the diplomacy of the hypocrite: one rule for China, another for the rest.</p><p>The other giant awakening in Asia is India. Not only is it exceptionally well-disposed towards Britain and the British, it possesses the legal framework that is the indispensable foundation of a liberal capitalist democracy - it is the world's largest democracy - and which makes it a much more congenial ally. India certainly has its problems - it lacks some of China's infrastructure of modern transport and communications, and caste and superstition still haunt it - but it is the better long-term bet in Asia, especially for Britain.</p><p>Our best Asia policy would be to say so, making a closer friend of one of Asia's two giants and serving notice on the other that while we are ready to be friends, we cannot turn a blind eye to repression and authoritarianism, both because it is wrong and because in the long run, it is economically self-defeating. Mr Brown's trip is an opportunity missed.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Will Hutton's The Writing on the Wall is now available in paperback at &pound;9.99</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2007/02/16/greatwall3.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/20/foreignpolicy.china","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/20/foreignpolicy.china","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Trouble back home","webPublicationDate":"2008-01-07T12:00:00Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2008/jan/07/troublebackhome","fields":{"body":"<p>Kenyans all over the world are <a href=\"http://www.eastandard.net/news/?id=1143979871\">shocked</a> at the incredible turn of events in our country. From overseas, we followed the events in real time from the three major television networks in Kenya, through <a href=\"http://www.africast.tv/\">Africast</a> and <a href=\"http://youtube.com/profile?user=NTVKenya\">YouTube</a> or via live blogging on sites such as <a href=\"http://www.kenyanpundit.com/\">Kenyan Pundit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kenyaimagine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=971&amp;Itemid=141\">Kenya Imagine</a>.</p><p>One week ago, we watched as the people of Kenya formed snaking lines towards ballot boxes then went home peacefully to await the results. It would only be the third time in the history of the country that there was a chance of presidential power changing hands. But when the time came to tally up the results, the numbers weren't adding up. In just four days Kenya went from being praised for conducting one of the most peaceful and orderly elections in Africa to a riotous citizenry across the country. A constitutional crisis had begun, marked by unprecedented violence on a national scale.</p><p>For Kenyans living in the diaspora, distress at the sabotage of fair elections caused a grief cycle of disbelief, anger and tension. From December 27 to January 1, many Kenyans abroad kept vigil, staying up all night to monitor the results. The elections happened to fall on a weekend and on a holiday which, for all Kenyans, meant it was extremely depressing to say \"Happy New Year\". President <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mwai_Kibaki\">Mwai Kibaki</a>, however, still found it in his heart to do so.</p><p>A dam of pent-up anger has burst to reveal the continual struggle to stand tall as a democracy but be knocked down again. Without excusing the violence, what you see is the outrage of a people denied their rights, because for once, they were promised a better future, from <a href=\"http://www.kibaki.co.ke/inner.asp?cat=mypromkenpple&amp;subcat=mypromise\">both</a> <a href=\"http://www.raila07.com/vision.html\">sides</a>, and got more of the same.</p><p>As the crisis brings <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7168551.stm\">ubiquitous headlines</a> of \"ethnic tensions\", there are also other concerns. With the Kenyan economy at a standstill, people not only in Kenya but the entire region are quickly running out of food, fuel and cash.</p><p>Another big problem is phone credit. Africa has seen a huge jump in mobile phones, which are fairly cheap and accessible and this is true for Kenya, where almost everyone has one. No doubt usage spiked because of the excitement of elections, but since most did not anticipate being barricaded in their homes for several days, phone credit ran out. Usually, one can ask a friend with credit to \"<a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/2005/default2.asp?active_page_id=383\">sambaza</a>\" or send them some airtime, however chances are they have run out too and so have all the shops. The solution would seem to have family and friends abroad help people with credit, but the technology does not allow for this kind of international transaction outside East Africa. The only silver lining is being able to receive incoming calls for free. This, coupled with the ban on live broadcasts essentially means that for now many Kenyans can only receive calls internationally. A strange state of affairs indeed.</p><p>Those international callers are the Kenyan diaspora, who must be on the phone incessantly, since Safaricom, a major mobile service provider, sent a mass text to all its users from the \"Government of Kenya\" warning them that the \"sending of hate messages inciting is an offence that could result in prosecution. Stop sending of information\". It is not clear what messages of hate were reportedly being sent. Nevertheless it must have been frightening for people to go from having a lively free press, to being in a media blackout and then having their only mode of communication being threatened.</p><p>The situation is dire - that's why global efforts to protest against Kibaki and the stalemate as well as bring awareness are under way. Last week there were demonstrations in <a href=\"http://www.kimmediagroup.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=309&amp;Itemid=668\">Atlanta</a>, <a href=\"http://cbs11tv.com/politics/Kenya.post.election.2.622057.html\">Dallas</a>, <a href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=5865437\">Houston</a>, <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200801030466.html\">Washington</a> DC and <a href=\"http://mshale.com/article.cfm?articleID=1647\">Saint Paul</a>, Minnesota, plus important marches in <a href=\"http://justice4kenya.com/link6.html\">London</a> at the Kenya High Commission and <a href=\"http://breakingnewskenya.wordpress.com/2008/01/03/kenyans-in-sa-plan-protest/\">Johannesburg</a>, South Africa. There are also some in the works for Canada, the Netherlands, and Australia.</p><p>But by far, the most coalition-building is occurring online. Kenyan blogs, forums, newsgroups and websites - not to mention Facebook and Myspace - have all gone into high gear spreading awareness and conducting calling/emailing campaigns. Kenyan Pundit blogger, and Harvard Law graduate Ory Okolloh, based in South Africa, noted that her site was overloaded with traffic and comments because so many people were looking for updates and answers. There are several petitions for Kibaki to <a href=\"http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/kibaki-must-step-down/signatures.html\">step down</a>. One of them, has more than 5,000 signatures from mostly Kenyans in at least 40 countries. This is in addition to the thousands of <a href=\"http://newsforums.bbc.co.uk/nol/thread.jspa?forumID=3991&amp;edition=2&amp;ttl=20080104031112\">comments</a> on major news websites in support of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raila_Odinga\">Raila Odinga</a> and calling for peace to take effect. The irony is that despite all the media attention on ethnic divisions, Kenyans, it seems, are more united.</p><p>Kenyans abroad shuttle back and forth to take care of ageing parents, see to children left behind or just visit with old friends at <a href=\"http://www.nairobijavahouse.com/\">Java House</a> or Carnivore. It feels like a grave injustice to see the country in such a state. It's a blunder of monumental proportions for the politicians who gambled with the future of Kenya. The road to not only restoring infrastructure and the economy, but the spirit of the law, is uncertain. Now, Kenyans all over the world are wondering when they will be able to say \"Kenya Yetu\", \"Our Kenya.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/07/troublebackhome","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/07/troublebackhome","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"50 people who could save the planet","webPublicationDate":"2008-01-05T12:55:45Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2008/jan/05/activists.ethicalliving","fields":{"body":"<p>Last year ended with the incongruous image of 10,000 politicians, businessmen, activists and scientists from 190 countries emitting vast quantities of greenhouse gases as they flew home from Bali clutching the bare bones of a global agreement on climate change. The agreement was to keep on talking to try to reach a deal by 2010. It was a diplomatic triumph, achieved after rows and high dramas, but it leaves all nations a mighty hill to climb. There is no agreement on what emission cuts need to be made by when or by whom, and the US is still deeply reluctant to do anything. It is a roadmap with no signposts.</p><p>Some were optimistic that a start had been made; some said that the earth's ecological situation was in a far more perilous state than had been thought. The iconic images of 2007 - polar bears stranded, glaciers melting in the Himalayas, forests coming down all over Africa and devastating floods and droughts from Bangladesh to Ghana - may be as nothing to what will happen if people do not take immediate action.</p><p>But who are the people who can bring about change, the pioneers coming up with radical solutions? We can modify our lifestyles, but that will never be enough. Who are the politicians most able to force society and industry to do things differently? Where are the green shoots that will get us out of the global ecological mess?</p><p>To come up with a list of the 50 people most able to prevent the continuing destruction of the planet, we consulted key people in the global environment debate. Our panel included scientists - former World Bank chief scientist and now the British government's scientific adviser on climate change, Bob Watson, Indian physicist and ecologist Vandana Shiva, Kenyan biologist and Nobel prize-winner Wangari Maathai; activists - Guardian columnist George Monbiot and head of Greenpeace International Gerd Leipold; politicians - Green party co-leader and MEP Caroline Lucas, and London mayor Ken Livingstone; sustainable development commissioner for the UK government Jonathon Porritt and novelist Philip Pullman.</p><p>Then the Guardian's science, environment and economics correspondents met to add their own nominations and establish a final 50. Great names were argued over, and unknown ones surfaced. Should Al Gore be on the list? He may have put climate change on the rich countries' agenda, but some felt his solution of trading emissions is not enough and no more than what all major businesses and western governments are now saying. But in the end he squeaked through.</p><p>There was also debate over Leonardo DiCaprio. It would be easy to sniff at someone who seemed to have merely pledged to forgo private jets and made a couple of films about the environment, but we felt the Hollywood superstar who has grabbed the green agenda had to be included because of the worldwide influence he is expected to have. Thanks to his massive celebrity status DiCaprio could be a crucial figure in persuading and leading the next generation.</p><p>Some people made it to the final 50 not just because of their work but because - like the man who has found a simple way to save energy in a refrigerator, or the boy who collects impressive amounts of money for the protection of tigers - they represented a significant grassroots technological or social movement. And some got on the list because they were considered the driving forces behind the decision-makers. One church leader, for example, made it largely because the world's religions have huge investments and are shifting the political landscape in the US and Europe.</p><p>The final list includes an Indian peasant farmer, the world's leading geneticist, German and Chinese politicians, a novelist, a film director, a civil engineer, a seed collector and a scientist who has persuaded an African president to make a tenth of his country a national park. There are 19 nationalities represented. Nearly one in five of those listed comes from the US, and one in three is from a developing country, suggesting that grassroots resourcefulness will be as important as money and technology in the future. Nearly one in three of the people chosen has a scientific background, even if not all practice what they studied. It's not a definitive list and there are no rankings, but these 50 names give a sense of the vast well of people who represent the stirrings of a remarkable scientific and social revolution, and give us hope as we enter 2008.<br/><strong>John Vidal</strong></p><p><strong>Terry Tamminen<br/> Climate policy adviser</strong></p><p>Born in Australia, Terry Tamminen, 57, has been a sheep farmer, a sea captain, a property dealer and, until last year, environmental adviser to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Largely because of Tamminen's influence, Arnie greened up, passed a raft of groundbreaking environmental laws, put pressure on polluting industries and is now politically popular. The world's seventh largest economy now has targets and timetables to shame nearly every country in the world - a 25% cut in emissions by 2020 - and is hailed as a beacon of eco responsibility. Tamminen has moved on to run the state's climate plan and is working with other US states and cities to create a de facto national climate change policy, and in so doing forcing President Bush's hand. Tamminen argues that the 5% of the world population who live in the US are responsible not for 25% of the world's climate emissions, as the textbooks say, but for at least 50% of them if you include the energy needed to power the Chinese factories that are churning out plastic toys and other mass consumer goods for the voracious US market.</p><p><strong>Capt Paul Watson<br/>Marine activist</strong></p><p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-332257012'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/01/04/paulwatsonNicBothmaEPA.jpg' alt='Capt Paul Watson' width='220' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>Paul Watson, 57, is the man Japanese whalers, Canadian seal hunters and illegal fishermen everywhere fear the most. The ultimate direct action man, he co-founded Greenpeace in the 70s and now has two boats that patrol the world 's oceans and confront anyone he has evidence of acting criminally. He is regularly denounced by governments as being an eco terrorist and a pirate after ramming and scuttling whalers, but Watson knows the law of the sea and has never been prosecuted. Now he is opening up a new role for environment groups. Last year the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society became an official law enforcement agency in Ecuador. Sea Shepherd partners the Ecuador police and can go on official patrols and make arrests in the Galapagos national maritime park. In one month last year he intercepted more than 19,000 shark fins and 92,000 sea cucumbers, and confiscated more than 35 miles of illegal longline. The idea of environmental activists becoming a new green police force may develop in years to come.</p><p> <strong>Vicki Buck<br/> Entrepreneur</strong></p><p> As the world scrambles to find a fuel supply that doesn't exacerbate global warming, New Zealander Vicki Buck, 51, has emerged as the acceptable face of biofuels. She's one-third of Aquaflow, a small company that was one of the first to crack the technology needed to harvest wild algae from sewage ponds, then extract fuel from it suitable for cars and aircraft. Companies from Boeing to Virgin are now beating a path to her Christchurch door. They're excited by the fact that it's theoretically possible to produce 10,000 gallons of algae oil per acre, compared with 680 gallons per acre for palm oil. Moreover, Buck has form: she was mayor of Christchurch, set up top eco-website <a href=\"http://www.celsias.com/\">celsias.com</a>, is a director of NZ Windfarms, and is now working on a start-up to reduce one major cause of climate change: the methane gas emitted from billions of animals which make up 49% of NZ's greenhouse gases - chiefly by changing their diet. </p><p><strong>Elon Musk<br/> Entrepreneur</strong></p><p> Elon Musk, 36, struck gold with PayPal (a system for paying bills online) during the 90s dot com boom and the South African wunderkind is now the major investor and chair of the board at Tesla Motors, a Silicon Valley electric car startup. The company plans to shake up the moribund US auto industry and dramatically curb CO2 emissions, ripping out the internal combustion engine and the petrol tank, and replacing both with a motor that boasts few moving parts and the sort of lithium batteries found in laptops. A limited-edition Tesla Roadster, a sports car that reaches 60 mph in less than four seconds, and can do 245 miles per charge, is due this year. Hollywood eco-stars such as George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio have bagged the first of a 600-car production run being built by Lotus in the UK. Next up, says Tesla, is a mass-market family sedan that could be fuelled by solar panels on the garage roof.</p><p><strong>Angela Merkel<br/>German chancellor</strong></p><p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-332257013'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/01/04/merkelMarcusBrandtAFP.jpg' alt='Angela Merkel' width='220' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>Angela Merkel, 53, has inherited Tony Blair's mantle as the politician forcing climate change the hardest on to the world stage, and she is a formidable advocate. The only major player left who helped hammer out the original global warming agreement at Kyoto in 1997, she is one of the very few with a grasp of what it means if humanity fails.</p><p>But it's what Germany does at home that gives Merkel authority. A quantum chemistry researcher brought up by a Lutheran pastor in communist East Germany, she was made German environment minister in 1994. The country now leads the world in turning away from coal and oil, and setting the highest targets for renewables and emission cuts.</p><p>She's not so popular with Greens, who accuse her of being a lackey to nuclear power and a friend of Bush, but they accept that she gets things done. Ten years ago, she shocked people when she said Germany should aim to raise the proportion of its electricity generated from renewable energy to 50% by 2050. It's now 12% - compare Britain's 3% - and is on track to be 20% in 12 years' time. She asked Germans to believe her when she said renewables would provide more jobs. There are now nearly 250,000 people working in the sector. And at the UN meeting at Bali last month, she told the EU it had to stick together and be ambitious. It led the fight against President Bush.</p><p>The speed at which Germany under Merkel is pursuing climate change policies is embarrassing the UK and other countries, which talk up the need for action, but deliver little. The UK aims to cut emissions by 60% by 2050 and argues that it needs nuclear power to do so. Germany, meanwhile, wants 40% cuts within 13 years without resort to nuclear power - something far harder.</p><p>\"The faster industrialised countries cut their emissions, the more willing other countries will be to do their bit,\" Merkel says. \"An intelligent and fair regulation of CO2 reductions is in everyone's best interests.\"</p><p>It's heady stuff for the world's energy watchers. German energy efficiency is to be improved by 3% a year for 20 years. The country expects to use 10% less electricity within a decade; all power stations are to be modernised; there's &pound;30bn for more renewables; railways will be further subsidised to lure people out of their cars and away from aeroplanes; plans for more wind turbines, photovoltaic electricity and biofuels will all be fast-forwarded; there is &pound;1,500m to reduce CO2 in existing buildings; and the solar market is growing by 40% a year. Few doubt that Germany is on track to achieve one of the greatest transformations in any country's use of power.</p><p>Merkel is matter of fact about the costs. One leading thinktank recently calculated that climate change would cost Germany nearly &pound;100bn a year by the middle of the century, so stumping up &pound;4bn over the next few years to avoid that is cheap, she reckons.</p><p>\"The costs of reducing emissions should be seem as a sound investment,\" Merkel says. \"Unabated climate change will slash prosperity by between 5% and 25%. Rigorous climate protection will cost only 1% of this prosperity and makes economic sense.\"</p><p>She is lucky in that Germany has a secret weapon in the battle against global warming: called the Renewable Energy Sources Act, it sets minimum prices for generating electricity. Anyone generating electricity from renewables now gets a guaranteed payment of up to three to four times the market rate, guaranteed for 20 years. This has not just kickstarted the whole German renewable industry beyond its wildest imaginings, it also reduces the payback time on such technologies and offers a high return on investment. The idea has since been adopted in many other countries, and was picked up by the Conservatives in Britain in mid-December.</p><p>Germany is far from green. It has immense ecological problems and is still the world's sixth greatest polluter, but for now it has gone renewable-mad with farmers, householders and businesses competing with each other to profit the most. If under Merkel Germany doesn't meet UN and EU targets, then it's nowhere will. </p><p> <strong>Caroline Lucas<br/> Politician</strong></p><p> Caroline Lucas, 47, is Green MEP for SE England and is likely to be elected the Greens' first sole leader next year when members have a referendum (hitherto the party has had a joint leadership). She was nominated here by Jonathon Porritt: \"She is the most inspiring politician the Green party has had since its inception - honest, articulate, passionate.\" In the meantime, she is intensely disliked by EU commissioners and much of big industry after drafting laws to force airlines to pay the true environmental and social costs of flying, forcing a legal investigation into nuclear power, taking on chemical companies and harassing the commission at every opportunity on trade, GM crops, globalisation and animal diseases. </p><p><strong>Bob Hertzberg<br/> Financier</strong></p><p> Bob Hertzberg, 53, founder of venture capital firm Renewable Capital, is one of a new breed of financier piling unprecedented amounts of money into renewable technologies. He ran for mayor of Los Angeles in 2005, finishing in third place. Renewable Capital has holdings in electric car companies, solar electric firms and windfarms. He is also backing a company in Cardiff that produces solar cells that do not need direct sunlight to generate electricity. In a process similar to photosynthesis, it uses nano-sized titanium crystals to turn light into electricity. </p><p><strong>Carlo Petrini<br/> Food activist</strong></p><p> Carlo Petrini, 58, is the only anti-McDonald's activist who has been welcomed to the offices of David Cameron, David Miliband, Prince Charles, Al Gore and Barack Obama. The founder of the international Slow Food movement, nominated here by Vandana Shiva, is idolised by rich and leisured foodies for promoting high-quality, small-scale farming and organising a relaxed life around long lunches. But Petrini, an Italian leftie of the old school, has a far more serious purpose than saving the pilchard or Parma ham. The Slow Food movement has now expanded across 100 countries and is throwing poisoned darts at the whole fast food culture and the multinational food producers that between them have wrecked so much of the environment.    </p><p><strong>Tewolde Egziabher<br/>Scientist</strong></p><p>Tewolde Egziabher, 67, a slight, Gandhian figure, is a UK-trained biologist who runs Ethiopia's environment protection agency and has proved himself an extraordinarily effective negotiator. At 2am at the 2002 Earth Summit , he made one of the most impassioned speeches heard at a global meeting. It had looked certain that the world's politicians would back a US proposal giving the World Trade Organisation the power to override international environment treaties, but he shamed the ministers into voting it down. No one could remember a personal intervention having such an impact, and his battles on behalf of developing countries to protect them from patents, unfettered free trade and GM crops are legendary. He was nominated by Vandana Shiva.</p><p><strong>Amory Lovins<br/>Physicist</strong></p><p>Think of a world where cars burn no oil and emit drinking water - or nothing at all. Where central power stations are redundant and buildings and parked vehicles produce enough energy to drive factories. Where no house is built that cannot generate electricity for others. Where carbon emissions have long been declining, and industries no longer waste almost all their material. This is not a pipe dream, but an increasingly likely scenario, here within a generation or two; that is the prediction of Amory Lovins, 60, an experimental physicist turned energy reduction pioneer who has had as profound an influence on the way people use energy as any man alive.</p><p>From a base in the Rockies, Lovins and his team of engineers and analysts show governments and large car, aviation and energy companies, as well as the likes of Walmart and Monsanto, how to profit from using less energy by applying knowledge of composite materials, engineering, design and energy storage. He says: \"Optimism beats fear or despair any time. There are excellent reasons to be encouraged. The global consciousness is higher at all levels. Revolutionary changes are taking place.\"</p><p>The car industry is speeding towards solutions Lovins proposed nearly 20 years ago, when he developed the idea of a \"hyper car\" - a carbon fibre hybrid petrol- and electricity-run machine that weighs next to nothing, has far fewer parts than conventional cars, does 150-200mpg and emits practically nothing. Last November, Toyota unveiled just that: a four-door carbon fibre model the same size as its green Prius but about a quarter of the weight of some Minis. It emits only one third of the Prius's greenhouse gases and does more than 100mpg. Now most car makers, with one eye on $100 dollar a barrel oil prices and an understanding that there is a vast market for green, are playing catch-up with Lovins' ideas.</p><p>While at Oxford in the 70s, Lovins helped set up Friends of the Earth in Britain and stopped Rio Tinto digging up Snowdonia. By the age of 28, he had worked out that the US could phase out fossil fuels not at a cost, but at a profit. \"We stand here confronted by insurmountable opportunities,\" he wrote. Now the revolution he helped shape is coming, and Lovins says the US can eliminate all oil use by 2050, \"and know unprecedented prosperity\".</p><p>\"We're finding in the auto sector speed of change at a fundamental level,\" he says. \"Change is coming out of fear and the car makers are gazing into the abyss. It is widely understood that incremental change is a high-risk strategy. Those who take the opportunity to change will do very well. We can save half the oil we use and the rest we can save with advanced biofuels.\"</p><p>He dismisses nuclear power as the fantasy of control and command states stuck in the 50s. \"New nuclear plants are so costly that spending the same on micropower can save two to 10 times more CO2, and sooner. In 2005, renewables produced one sixth of the world's total electricity and a third of new electricity. This revolution already happened - sorry if you missed it!\"</p><p>Lovins works by seeking efficiency at every point. Take the most energy-efficient existing hybrid car, he says. Drive it carefully and you can double efficiency. Make it ultra-light, and you can redouble it. Run it on an advanced biofuel, and you can quadruple its oil efficiency again. If you then give it batteries that can be recharged by connecting a plug to an electric power source and have a good economic model to pay for the batteries, then you at least double efficiency again. Put all this together, and you can be down to about 3% of the oil per mile you started with. And Lovins says he has never known any company invest in energy and not make a profit.</p><p>He's working with the Pentagon, which spends nearly a third of its vast budget on moving troops and equipment around. If it invested in really energy-efficient goals, in the same way as, say, it invested in the internet, GPS and chips, Lovins says it would shift the entire global energy landscape. The knock-on effect would transform civilian car, truck and plane industries, too. The cost? It's a $180bn investment, he reckons - or roughly what the UK spends on its health service in a year. </p><p>     <strong>Madhav Subrmanian<br/> Schoolboy</strong></p><p>Madhav Subrmanian is the next generation's face of conservation, a 12-year-old Indian boy who goes round Mumbai collecting money for tiger conservation. With his friends Kirat Singh, Sahir Doshi and Suraj Bishnoi, he set up Kids For Tigers which works in hundreds of schools. He writes poems, sings on the streets, sells merchandise and has collected Rs500,000 (£6,500) in two years. Conservation awareness is growing in middle-class India, largely through young activists like him.   </p><p><strong>Marina Silva<br/> Politician</strong></p><p> Marina Silva, 49, is Brazil's environment minister. The daughter of a Brazilian rubber tapper, she spent her childhood collecting rubber from the Amazon forest and demonstrating against the destruction wrought by illegal loggers. In one of the great political journeys, she rose from being illiterate at 16 to become Brazil's youngest senator, and is now the woman most able to prevent the Amazon's wholesale ruin. Under her watch, deforestation has reduced by nearly 75% and millions of square miles of reserves have been given to traditional communities. Last year 1,500 companies were raided and one million cubic metres of illegally felled timber were confiscated. But the future, says Silva, is peril ous. The only way that long-term loss will be averted is with foreign help. \"We don't want charity, it's a question of ethics of solidarity,\" she says. </p><p><strong>Robin Murray<br/> Industrial economist</strong></p><p> Central government and local authorities in the UK turn to Robin Murray, 67, when they need to reduce waste. The author of three influential books, he came up with the phrase \"zero waste\" - the idea that people can mimic biology and produce, consume and recycle everything without throwing anything away. Instead of seeing waste as a problem, he argues that it can become a resource for someone else, and instead of thinking about recycling, he says it is more sensible to think about design so that products do not need to be recycled - instead they could be used repeatedly or composted. It may need an industrial revolution and a total makeover of the global economy to achieve Murray's truly wasteless society, but zero waste is now the goal of hundreds of local authorities and is spreading around the world, back ed by designers, planners and companies from San Francisco to Wellington in New Zealand.   </p><p><strong>Laurie David<br/> Activist</strong></p><p> Laurie David, 49, is a powerhouse with some heavy-hitting connections even by Hollywood standards. Whether spreading the word about global warming on Oprah, writing a children's bestseller on the subject, producing Al Gore's breakthrough film, An Inconvenient Truth, or making the HBO documentary Too Hot Not To Handle, which shows what lies in store for the US if it does not reverse its policies on climate change, David has become a showbiz standard-bearer. She has reached across the US political chasm by co-founding the Stop Global Warming Virtual March with Robert Kennedy Jr and Senator John McCain, though her critics say her lifestyle leaves a hefty carbon footprint.   </p><p><strong>Patriarch Bartholomew<br/> Leader of the Orthodox Church</strong></p><p> Patriarch Bartholomew I, Archbishop of Constantinople and New Rome, is the spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians around the world. He's also extremely green, each year taking church leaders of all denominations to areas of the world beset with environmental problems - including the Amazon, the Arctic and the Danube. After announcing, on an island in the Aegean, that attacks on the environment should be considered sins , he called pollution of the world's waters \"a new Apocalypse\" and led global calls for \"creation care\". Way ahead of his time, he has made the environment an increasingly powerful strand of Christian thinking in Britain - and latterly the US, where traditionally right wing churches have followed his lead and now openly counter President Bush's stance. Bartholomew, 67, is now heavily influencing the Pope and has shared a green stage with him several times in Rome. It all suggests institutional Christianity is greening up fast after centuries of ambivalence and outright hostility.</p><p><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio<br/>Actor</strong></p><p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-332257014'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/01/04/LeoChrisPolkAP.jpg' alt='Leonardo DiCaprio' width='220' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>Icebergs are becoming a recurring theme in the life of 33-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio. First, his acting career went stellar after playing the lead in Titanic. Now it is dramatic footage of icebergs and polar bears, both threatened by climate change, that is a striking feature of his documentary The 11th Hour (released in the UK next month), a powerful call to arms for our species to protect the environment a great deal better.</p><p>Combining the diametrically opposed worlds of the A-list Hollywood star and the impassioned environmentalist is a fraught, sometimes contradictory process, but DiCaprio has pulled it off, becoming one of the world's most high-profile campaigners.</p><p>His primary aim, he says, is to raise awareness, not to preach: \"It's not about imposing a certain belief system or a way of life on people in any economic background. It's about just being aware of this issue - that's the most important thing - and really trying to say, 'Next time I vote, next time I buy something, I'm just going to be aware of what's really going on.' \"</p><p>The first campaigning steps were taken a decade ago after he found himself the target of angry environmentalists. During the filming of The Beach, the bestselling novel about backpackers seeking a shangri-la off the Thai coast, the production team was accused of damaging a pristine beach in a national marine park - in an attempt to make it look even more \"perfect\" for the cameras, some palm trees were temporarily planted and sand dunes moved. Despite the authorities giving the film-makers permission, their actions made headlines around the world.</p><p>Evidently stung by the criticism, in 1998 DiCaprio established the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, which has since collaborated with the likes of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Oceana, the Natural Resources Defence Council and the Dian Fossey Foundation to raise awareness, particularly among children, of environmental issues.</p><p>In 2000, he was the US chair of Earth Day, the annual celebration of the environment. \"Enough is enough,\" he told the crowd in Washington DC. \"We must set an example now and move environmentalism from being the philosophy of a passionate minority... to a way of life that automatically integrates ecology into governmental policy and normal living standards. We are entering an environmental age whether we like it or not.\" But it was his Earth Day interview with President Clinton on ABC News that caused the biggest ripples: ABC journalists were said to be furious that a young, heart-throb actor had been allowed to do such an important interview. The final edit of the interview itself was fairly soft in tone, but it did include questions that now seem ahead of their time - namely, about the science of climate change, the lobbying power of Big Oil, ways to decrease the use of SUVs and how vulnerable New Orleans was to sea-level rises. There was even a lengthy exchange about hybrid cars, long before they became the car du jour of Hollywood stars.</p><p>As DiCaprio's acting career matured, he continued his parallel life as an environmental activist, speaking at colleges and campaigning on behalf of John Kerry in the 2004 presidential campaign. And for his new documentary, he has mustered the likes of Stephen Hawking, Bill McKibben, David Suzuki, Mikhail Gorbachev and Wangari Maathai (below) to take part. He limits his own appearance in the film - essentially a series of talking heads set against library footage - to that of host and narrator. Since its release in the US last year, it has been dubbed the unofficial sequel to Al Gore's The Inconvenient Truth.</p><p>\"It was a learning process,\" says DiCaprio, \"and I wanted to play the role of investigator - from watching documentaries at a young age, from seeing films on rainforests in Brazil and really appreciating the beauty of our planet, and then learning more and more about human impact and wanting to do something about it.\"</p><p>His next eco-project is already in production - he's a producer for a Discovery Channel show called Eco-Town, which records how a Kansas town devastated by a tornado in 2006 attempts to rebuild itself as a \"model of green living\".</p><p><strong>Andrew Kimbrell<br/> Lawyer</strong></p><p> Andrew Kimbrell, 51, was a concert pianist and music teacher in New York before he joined an emerging breed of activist lawyers forcing governments to take the environment much more seriously. Last year in the US Supreme Court, he defeated the Bush administration's policy of refusing to regulate global warming. It was a defining moment in the American debate and forced Bush to regulate carbon dioxide pollution from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. Kimbrell is now working with others to devise a new concept of 'natural law' based on the idea that humans are just one part of a wider community of beings and that the welfare of each member of that community depends on the welfare of the earth as a whole. It sounds heretical now, but is traditional in many societies and one to watch in the west.   </p><p><strong>René Ngongo<br/> Biologist</strong></p><p> Congo DRC is home to the world's second greatest stands of tropical forest after the Amazon, mainly because no timber company could work there during the decades of civil war and insurgency. Now that the war is over, European, Asian and US logging companies are piling in, with the help of the World Bank and international donors, to strip Congo of its most valuable wood. Potentially, it's an ecological and social disaster: more than 20 million people, not least the Pygmies, depend on the forest for their living. Ngongo, 36, is a biology academic from Goma, who has travelled the country investigating the corrupt timber industry and taken his findings to London, Washington and Brussels. He's the new face of environmentalism in the south and was nominated by the head of Greenpeace International, Gerd Leipold, as the kind of activist who will make waves in the next 20 years.   </p><p><strong>Zhengrong Shi<br/> Scientist</strong></p><p> Dr Zhen grong Shi, 44, is living proof of the cliché that every crisis presents an opportunity. China's search for alternative energy has made the solar cell scientist and businessman one of the country's richest men. The value of his company, Suntech Power, one of the world's 10 biggest manufacturers of solar panels, has risen above the $6bn mark since it became the first Chinese firm to list on the New York stock exchange. Dr Shi is a farmer's son from Jiangsu province, and was put up for adoption because his family were too poor to raise him. He set up Suntech in 2001 , and the company expects to grow far bigger, possibly helping China overtake Japan as the world's leading supplier of the technology. Shanghai plans to subsidise 100,000 solar panels for the city and the state is preparing to build the world's biggest solar generating facility in the Gobi desert.   </p><p><strong>Joss Garman<br/> Activist</strong></p><p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-332257015'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/01/04/jossgarmanGrahamTurner.jpg' alt='Joss Garman' width='220' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>Joss Garman, 22 and just out of university, has been a British environmental activist for eight years. Dubbed the \"new Swampy\", he has been arrested more than 20 times and helped set up Plane Stupid, a direct action group which in its short-haul life has infuriated airline companies and airports, disrupted the transport select committee and shut down easyJet's London offices. BAA tried to stop Garman and others organising the climate change camp at Heathrow last summer, but the camp went ahead and Garman demonstrated elsewhere. He was nominated by George Monbiot and Philip Pullman as one of the activists of the future. \"He's now a campaigner at Greenpeace, though he's only about 12,\" Monbiot says.</p><p><strong>Craig Venter<br/>Geneticist</strong></p><p>Craig Venter is often referred to as a \"maverick\" scientist, with the implication that he is a rogue, a bad boy of biology. Yet it is the strict dictionary definition of the word that suits him best: a person of independent or unorthodox views. And when it comes to addressing the world's environmental problems, that may be just what we need.</p><p>As the head of various firms and institutes, some public and some private, Venter has ambitious plans for the planet. By harnessing the power of microbes that his scientists have discovered deep in the sea and under the ground, he thinks we could revolutionise fuel production and bring down emissions. Venter has put his army of bugs to work on everything from renewable supplies of energy-rich gases such as methane, to advanced biofuels that don't threaten food production and could be used to fuel aeroplanes.</p><p>One has the ability to turn the carbon dioxide into methane; it could be put to work converting CO2 captured from coal power plants and stored underground. \"You could pump the CO2 down, convert it into methane and burn it all over again,\" he says. Another turns coal into natural gas, speeding up what is essentially a natural process and reducing both the energy needed to extract the fossil fuel and the amount of pollution caused when it is burned.</p><p>\"Theoretically, there's no limit to what we're doing,\" Venter says. \"Most people working on these problems talk about linear progress. I like to think in terms of exponential patterns of change.\"</p><p>He talks of hundreds of thousands of biological refineries spread across nations, each churning out green replacements for fossil fuels. \"It's the sheer volume we're talking about with oil, gas and coal that makes the problem so large. But what I've made work really well is massively parallel processes [a system of linked computers tackling problems on a super scale]. Now I would like to apply that to fuel production.\"</p><p>A former high-school drop-out, surf bum and Vietnam veteran, Venter earned his reputation for working outside the boundaries of conventional science with his efforts earlier this decade to decode the entire human genetic code, the genome. At the time, scientists believed that deciphering this alphabet soup of genes would unleash a revolution in medicine. Venter agreed, and saw commercial as well as medical gain.</p><p>He envisaged a giant DNA database that drugs companies would pay to search through, and led a company aiming to do just that. His vision clashed with a publicly funded scientific initiative to sequence the genome and make the information available for free, led by numerous Nobel prize-winners. The acrimonious race that ensued was eventually declared a draw, though Venter's notoriety was complete when he subsequently revealed that most of the DNA his team had decoded was, in fact, his own.</p><p>Venter is not giving up his human genomics work, but says that he is now drawn to environmental problems by their urgency - and by the rapidity with which he thinks he can find solutions. Rather than the two decades or so it can take to bring a drug to market, he envisages his modified micro-organisms producing commercial fuels within just a few years.</p><p>Recently, Venter has spent much of his time cruising the world's oceans, sifting them for useful microbes, and was distressed by what he found. \"Not a day went by when we didn't see huge amounts of plastic trash in the water. We're treating the planet as our toilet and we think when we flush the chain the problems disappear, but they don't. We have to find ways to change.\"</p><p>One of Venter's more controversial suggestions for tackling environmental problems involves a synthetic lifeform. Not content with setting existing microbes to work, he wants to create an artificial bacterium, with genes, traits and abilities introduced from beyond nature's catalogue. He hopes to announce its creation next year, a step forward that will place him firmly back in the spotlight. \"We need advances in every field,\" he says. \"We're not going to come up with a miracle solution - we'll need thousands or tens of thousands of solutions.\" </p><p><strong>Henry Saragih<br/> Union leader and farmer</strong></p><p> Henry Saragih is a small farmer who has hardly seen his wife and children in 15 years since taking on the Indonesian government and the palm oil barons of Sumatra and Kalimantan. Companies with links to government are devastating vast areas of Indonesia and southeast Asia to grow palm oil to supply Europe's cars and kitchens with biofuel and cooking oils, and Saragih is one of the few people standing in their path. Not only does he lead a union of several million agitated Indonesian peasants, but he also heads Via Campesina, the global movement of increasingly militant peasant farmers which campaigns for land reform in 80 countries. Saragih and his colleagues are lobbying the UN and the World Trade Organisation. How this struggle plays out in the next 20 years will determine whether there is any rainforest left intact south-east Asia in 50 years' time, and possibly the political future of many developing countries.   </p><p><strong>Eric Rey<br/> Bioscientist</strong></p><p> Eric Rey is not a natural ally of the broad green movement, at least in Europe. He leads a biotechnology company, Arcadia, that develops GM crops. One of his biggest customers is Monsanto. Yet Arcadia's GM technology could help the fight against climate change. Its plants are engineered to require less nitrogen fertiliser, so lowering emissions of nitrous oxide - a greenhouse gas some 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. World agriculture accounts for 17% of industrial greenhouse gas emissions, more than the transport sector. Arcadia's first commercial crop could be rice. Swapping global rice supply to the GM version, the company says, would save the equivalent of 50 million tons of carbon dioxide each year.  </p><p><strong>Bjørn Lomborg<br/> Statistician</strong></p><p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-332257016'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/01/04/bjornlomborgmartingodwin.jpg' alt='Bjorn Lomborg' width='220' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>Bjørn Lomborg, 42, has become an essential check and balance to runaway environmental excitement. In 2004, the Dane made his name as a green contrarian with his bestselling book The Skeptical Environmentalist, and outraged scientists and green groups around the world by arguing that many claims about global warming, overpopulation, energy resources, deforestation, species loss and water shortages are not supported by analysis. He was accused of scientific dishonesty, but cleared his name. He doesn't dispute the science of climate change, but questions the priority it is given. He may look increasingly out of step, but Lomborg is one of the few academics prepared to challenge the consensus with credible data.   </p><p><strong>Gavin Schmidt<br/> Climatologist</strong></p><p> Gavin Schmidt, 38 and British, is a climate modeller at the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. He founded <a href=\"http://realclimate.org/\">RealClimate.org</a> with colleagues in 2004. Offering \"climate science from climate scientists\", the site has quickly become a must-read for interested amateurs, and a perfect foil to both the climate sceptic misinformation that saturates sections of the web and the overexcitement of the claims of some environmentalists. Unapologetically combative, technical and high-brow, the site and its contributors - essentially blogging in their spare time - nail the myth that scientists struggle to communicate their work. Whenever a major flaw is pointed out in the global consensus on climate change, or new evidence is discovered to blame it on the sun, it is always worth checking RealClimate. The site has a policy of not getting dragged into the political or economic aspects of science, but it's fairly easy to guess which side it's on.</p><p><strong>Rajendra Singh<br/>Water conservationist</strong></p><p>In 1984 Dr Rajendra Singh, now 49, was working in the semi-desert Indian state of Rajastan. He planned to set up health clinics in the rural villages, but was shocked when he went to a place called Gopalpura. \"This area was devastated and people were fleeing, leaving their children, women and older people behind,\" Singh says. \"It was then an old man told me that they needed neither medicines nor food. He said all they needed was water.</p><p>\"It moved me so much and I started finding out ways to help. But the region was arid, all the rivers were dry and the land was parched. The only source of water was rainwater, but that was scarce and there was not nearly enough for all the needs of the region.\"</p><p>A mix of modern technology and villagers simply neglecting traditional ways of conserving water had led to an ecological disaster. Singh found that the villages no longer used small earth dams - or johads - to collect surface water but instead now relied on \"modern\" tube wells. As they bored their wells deeper and deeper into the ground and sucked out ever more underground water, so the water table had dropped alarmingly and ever deeper wells were required.</p><p>Lower water levels meant that the wells were not full, the forests and trees were dying off, and erosion was worsening. It was a vicious circle. With less irrigation water, farming declined and men migrated to cities for work. Women and children then had to spend up to 10 hours a day fetching firewood and water, and the shrinking labour force sapped people's will to maintain the old johads. The whole region faced disaster.</p><p>Singh and his colleagues began digging out an old johad pond in Gopalpura. Seven months later, it was, almost miraculously, nearly five feet full of water. And once the rains eventually came, not only did it fill to the brim, but a nearby long-dry well began flowing again. The following year, the village joined in to rebuild a second dam, and by 1996 Gopalpurans had recreated nine johads that between them held millions of litres of water. Meanwhile, the groundwater level had risen to 6.7m, up from an average of 14m below the ground. The village wells were full again.</p><p>\"It was only due to political reasons that the [johad] system fell apart,\" Singh says. \"We worked for four years in Gopalpura and slowly a huge area turned green. People came back, they started farming again and the visual impact was so impressive that people from adjoining areas started calling us for help.\"</p><p>Singh is now known as the Rain Man of Rajastan, having brought water back to more than 1,000 villages and got water to flow again in all five major rivers in Rajastan. He has so far helped to build more than 8,600 johads and other structures to collect water for the dry seasons. The forest cover has increased by a third because the water table has risen, and antelope and leopard have returned to the region. It has also been one of the cheapest regenerations of a region ever known - in Rajastan, villages have been brought back to life sometimes for just a few hundred pounds, far less than the cost of the single borehole that almost destroyed them.</p><p>\"See the earth like a bank,\" Singh says. \"If you make regular deposits of water, you'll always have some to withdraw. If you are just taking, you will have nothing in your account.\"</p><p>Erratic rains and longer droughts are becoming more frequent around the world with changing weather patterns and climate change, and the lessons taught by Singh in Rajastan are now being applied all over India and Africa. In the next 30 years, water \"harvesting\" is expected to become an essential way to save water everywhere from England to Uganda and Arizona. In south-east England, there is barely enough rainfall now, let alone for the expected population within 20 years. Procedures likely to be introduced will include gadgets that ensure you can't leave a running tap, baths that hold less water, gutters that collect water, systems for using waste water for gardens. \"It's the same principle everywhere, but we all have to learn it,\" Singh says. </p><p><strong>Ken Livingstone<br/> London mayor</strong></p><p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-332257017'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2007/12/13/Ken440.jpg' alt='Ken Livingstone' width='220' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Ken Livingstone.

The capital has seen a huge increase in cycling, and from this month most of the city's public buildings will be \"retrofitted\" to save energy. It's beginning to work, he says: four years ago, more than one in three Londoners used their cars every day; now few er than one in five do. But he can do little about airports. Almost one-third of London emissions come from City airport and Heathrow, and there are plans for both to nearly double in size.

In the tropics especially, high-rises are traditionally the most unecological of all buildings, often wasting up to 30% more energy than lower structures built with the same materials. Yeang uses walls of plants, photo voltaics, scallop-shaped sunshades, advanced ventilation and whatever he can to collect water and breezes. The idea is to make buildings run as complete ecosystems with little external energy supply. He's not there yet, but the possibility of the green skyscraper is developing fast as ecological imperatives filter into the consciousness of the startlingly backward world of international architecture.   </p><p><strong>Massoumeh Ebtekar<br/> Politician</strong></p><p> Appointed Iran's first woman vice-president by President Khatami in 1997, Massoumeh Ebtekar, 47, later became an inspired environment minister. She made a name for herself in 1979 as the 19-year-old revolutionary student who became chief interpreter in the 444-day US embassy siege in Tehran. She left government office in 2005, is now a Tehran city councillor and heads the Centre for Peace and the Environment. Anything green has taken a back seat since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took power, and Iran's cities are choked with incredible pollution - but because of Ebtekar there are now thousands of environment groups led by women seeking change. 'We need to put spiritual and ethical values into the political arena... You don't see the power of love, you don't see the power of the spirit, and as long as that goes on, the environment is going to be degraded and women are going to be in very difficult circumstances,\" she says.   </p><p><strong>Rebecca Hosking<br/> Camera operator</strong></p><p> Rebecca Hosking, 33, is the young BBC camerawoman who went to an atoll in Hawaii, found wildlife dead or dying after ingesting bits of plastic, and returned to the small town of Modbury in Devon with a fine film, and a desire to try to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/nov/23/plasticbags.recycling\">ban plastic bags</a>. In May 2007, the town became the first in Europe to go plasticfree and since then at least 80 other places have decided to follow suit. London Councils, the umbrella group for 33 local authorities, aims to reduce the 4bn plastic bags sent to landfill from the capital each year and has proposed a law that would force shoppers to use their own bags or buy reusable ones at the tills. Hosking has clearly tapped into a new public mood and has found that there is no need to wait for governments to effect change.

It is she who has coaxed the Mexican army, Japanese geishas, French celebrities, 10,000 Malaysian schools, the president of Turkmenistan and children in Rotherham to roll up their sleeves, dig a hole and plant a tree.</p><p>It was an off-the-cuff remark of hers in 2006 that led to this far-flung initiative. She was in the US accepting an award when a businessman told her that his company was planning to plant a million trees. Jokingly, Maathai, who has spent most of a lifetime planting saplings, responded, \"That's great. But what we really need is to plant one billion trees.\" The UN - and the Green Belt Movement Maathai founded among African women - picked up the challenge.</p><p>In just over a year, in one of the largest mobilisations of people for a cause since the Asian tsunami, 1.5bn trees have been planted in nearly 50 countries, and a further billion more are pledged. Countries have fallen over themselves to plant the most and be linked with Maathai: Indonesia planted 79m in a day; Turkey says it has planted 500m, Mexico 250m, and India says that it will replant six million hectares of degraded forest.</p><p>Many of these saplings may not survive more than a few weeks, and the numbers are not to be trusted, but the billion tree campaign shows that Maathai - a professor of biology and mother of three children - has gone from being almost unknown in 2003 to a global treasure in just a few years. There is now barely a president or prime minister in Europe, Asia or Africa who has not invited Maathai to endorse their plans or tried to sign her up as a goodwill ambassador to show off their newfound enthusiasm for the environment. She has addressed the UN general assembly, carried the flag at the Olympic games, and received sackfuls of citations and awards. Maathai has succeeded in putting deforestation high on the agenda in developing countries, just as Al Gore made people in rich countries aware of climate change.</p><p>She has made tree planting an act of transformation in which everyone can engage. \"The planting of trees is the planting of ideas,\" Maathai says. \"By starting with the simple step of digging a hole and planting a tree, we plant hope for ourselves and for future generations.</p><p>\"The first steps were really to talk to women,\" she explains, \"and to convince them that we could do something about their environment. They didn't have firewood, they didn't have clean drinking water and they didn't have adequate food. A tree brings transformation.\"</p><p>Maathai has also made it a political act. Like many others in developing countries, she has been beaten up, arrested and imprisoned for speaking out against environmental destruction, government oppression and abuse of human rights. \"When we were beaten up, it was because we were telling the government not to interfere with the forests,\" she says. \"We were confronted by armed police and guards who physically removed us from the forests as we sought to protect these green spaces from commercial exploitation.\"</p><p>While Maathai is feted abroad as the first African woman Nobel laureate, she has always had a rocky time at home with party politics. She tried to stand for president in 1997, but her party withdrew her candidacy. She was finally elected an MP in 2002 with a 98% vote, but just before Christmas she failed to win even a nomination from the ruling party for the end-of-year election.</p><p>Maathai's strength now lies in what she stands for. \"If I have learned one thing,\" she says, \"it is that humans are only part of this ecosystem - when we destroy the ecosystem, we destroy ourselves, for on its survival depends our own.\" </p><p><strong>Peter Garrett<br/> Politician</strong></p><p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-332257019'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/01/04/petergarrettFirdiaLisnawatiAP.jpg' alt='Peter Garrett' width='220' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>Peter Garrett, 54, is the former punk lead singer of the disbanded Australian rock group Midnight Oil, who continued his weird journey from radical muso to establishment politician when he was appointed Australia's environment minister in November.

Urban squalor is one of the biggest problems of the age, and by 2030 the number of slum dwellers is projected to reach two billion - a recipe for poverty, disease and political instability. Arputham has pioneered a way to help the poor negotiate with city authorities to secure land ownership - the greatest barrier to improving slums.

As a result, in less than 10 years, Germany is heading towards selfsufficiency in energy. His greatest success has been a \"feed in tariff law\". This forces power companies to buy electricity generated by the public at more than triple market prices; 300,000 homeowners, farmers and small businesses have leapt in and started selling. Nearly 3% of Germany's electricity now comes from the sun. Spain, Portugal, Greece, France and Italy are all now introducing their version of Scheer's law and pressure is building in Britain and other countries.   </p><p><strong>Mohammed Valli Moosa<br/> Civil servant</strong></p><p> Mohammed Valli Moosa, 50, was South Africa's environment minister from 1999 to 2004.

Known as pebble bed modular reactors, these are smaller, cheaper and reportedly safer than other designs and Valli Moosa says they could be the base of the 21st eco-economy - ideally for desalination plants and creating the raw material for the heralded but slow to appear hydrogen economy.

There he developed the idea that not only did everyone on earth have an equal right to emit CO2, but that all countries should agree to an annual per capita ration or quota of greenhouse gases.</p><p>That was the easy bit. But then the musician, who had played with the LPO and had written for the Royal Ballet, went further. Meyer proposed that each country move progressively to the same allocation per inhabitant by an agreed date. This meant that rich countries would have steadily to cut back their emissions, while poor ones would be allowed steadily to grow theirs, with everyone eventually meeting in the middle at a point where science said the global maximum level of emissions should be set. He called it \"contraction and convergence\" (C&amp;C).</p><p>Meyer is nothing if not determined. Since 1990, earning next to nothing and sometimes practically begging for money so he could lobby international meetings, he has pressed C&amp;C at every level of global government. Early opposition came from British civil servants, who said it was akin to communism, and major environmental groups, which were ideologically opposed to any kind of trading emissions. For many years the US government had no interest in any such deal.</p><p>But the climate stakes have risen with every new scientific report, and the politicians and environment groups have moved on. As the urgency for a global agreement has grown, so C&amp;C has emerged as one of the favourites to break the international impasse.</p><p>\"Its advantage is that it is far simpler and fairer than the Kyoto agreement, which applied only to a few rich countries,\" Meyer says. It also allows science to set the optimum level of emissions; it gets round long-standing US objections that poor countries should be part of a global agreement; and it is inherently pro-business, because it encourages rich and poor countries to trade emissions between themselves.</p><p>The long years of single-minded lobbying mean that Meyer's idea now has some powerful backers, including, in Britain, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution; 180 MPs have supported it in an early day motion, and the government, equivocal so far, is moving towards a version of it. It has become official policy in India, China and most African countries. Germany and India are expected to run with it in UN meetings. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has backed C&amp;C publicly.</p><p>Other proposals are emerging and it will take two more years to thrash out a system that will please everyone. But few have the elegance of C&amp;C. \"It's the least unfair of all the proposals that have been put forward,\" Meyer says. \"It secures survival by correcting both fatal poverty and fatal climate change in the same arrangement.\"</p><p>Writing music and calculating emissions have a lot in common, he says. \"Look at a sheet of music and you would not know what it was. But when you hear it played, then it's beautiful. Equally, when you read the calculations on countries' gases, they mean nothing. But when you work out how you can reduce them, it's clear that it's the best thing for humanity.\"</p><p>Meyer still plays the violin every day, but seldom with an orchestra. \"I just did not realise that it would take quite so long to change the world,\" he says. </p><p><strong>Monica Howe<br/> Bike activist</strong></p><p> Monica Howe, 31, is the sharp end of the grassroots debate in Los Angeles, the global car culture's smog- choked, road-raged, increasingly grid locked spiritual home. Her Bicycling Coalition group is remapping the megalopolis's mean and potholed streets by forging bike routes, organising cycle rallies, helping fledgling cyclists overcome traffic fears, and challenging the mindset at City Hall, where cyclists tend to be greeted with disbelief. Howe says membership is rising, and cyclists are pedalling into the cityscape as public attitudes, swayed by concerns about air quality, traffic congestion and global warming, begin to shift.

As a boy he worked on his family's farm, as a young congressman in the 70s he held the first hearings on greenhouse gases, and shortly before becoming Bill Clinton's vice-president in 1992, he wrote a bestselling clarion call - Earth In The Balance. And despite or because of the hanging chads debacle in 2000, he is still beating the drum. It was his Oscar-winning slideshow-cum-documentary An Inconvenient Truth, that helped gain him a half-share in the 2007 Nobel peace prize, and he can be heard tirelessly lecturing around the world (at a reported $100,000 a throw). His latest book, The Assault On Reason, takes swipes at the media, cowardly politicians and the Bush administration. But his speech last month at Bali, where he managed to criticise the US without saying it should commit to anything, shows that, at 59, he remains a politician at heart.   </p><p><strong>Chris Tuppen<br/> Businessman</strong><br/> Chris Tuppen, BT's head of sustainable development, wrote the company's first environmental report in 1992. Since then his lead has been followed by thousands of other companies, yet BT has managed to stay one step ahead. It was a pioneer in buying electricity from renewable sources and has cut down on travel. Last year the company announced it would build its own windfarms to help meet its mammoth demand for electricity, and published a set of ambitious targets which include reductions in the carbon footprints of its employees. Chief is a pledge to slash its greenhouse gas emissions within a decade to 80% below what they were in 1996. BT is an example of how being green pays: the company says its efforts have saved more than £119m in power bills since 1991.   </p><p><strong>Dieter Salomon<br/> Mayor of Freiburg</strong></p><p> Freiburg in southern Germany is the most ecologically-aware town in Europe and possibly the rich world. The city of 250,000 people dubs itself a \"solar region\" and gathers nearly as much power from the sun as is collected in all of Britain. It's stacked with research establishments and its solar firms employ thousands of people. It is also the playground of architect Rolf Disch, who builds houses that need to be heated for only a week each year and whose cost is paid for by the electricity generated by the panels on their roofs. Salomon, 47, says that by 2010, at least 10% of all the energy consumed in Freiburg will come from renewables. To attain this, a huge area of the city centre has been turned into a pedestrian zone and there are 500km of bike paths. More than a third of all journeys are made by bike, and there are fewer than 200 parking places for cars in the centre compar ed with 5,000 for bikes. The snag? The quality of life is so good in Freiburg that too many people want to live there and it's hard for anyone to buy a house.</p><p><strong>Bija Devi<br/>Farm manager</strong></p><p>Bija Devi saves seeds for future generations. She already has in her \"bank\" 1,342 types of cereals, pulses, fruits and vegetables, though she has no idea of their scientific names. She has worked as a farmer since the age of seven, never went to school and has never heard the words \"wheat\" or \"turnip\". Yet she now heads a worldwide movement of women trying to rescue and conserve crops and plants that are being pushed to extinction in the rush to modernise farming. And in so doing she is helping rejuvenate Indian culture.</p><p>Apart from collecting and storing seeds from all over the country, Devi is teaching farmers, distributing seeds and experimenting with them. It's called the Navdanya (Nine Seeds) movement because it was inspired by a southern Indian custom of planting nine seeds in a pot on the first day of the year. Women would take the pots to the river nine days later to compare and exchange seeds so that each family could plant the best seeds, thus optimising food supplies.</p><p>Today, Devi has farmers queueing up for seeds at her project's base, a 40-acre farm in the foothills of the Himalayas in Dehradun. When she started 14 years ago, with ecologist Vandana Shiva, she had to plead with the farmers to accept that ecological security was of fundamental importance, and that there were advantages to sowing older, indigenous seeds rather than the newer, high-yielding \"hybrid\" or GM seeds. These give larger crops but require considerable input of pesticides and fertilisers, and more water.</p><p>Women are responsible for sowing, harvesting and storing food, while it is up to the men to prepare the soil. \"There was no tangible benefit for them in using our seeds,\" Devi says. \"But over time they realised how the soil was retaining its fertility, how the crop was free from diseases and pests. Now they come to us on their own.\"</p><p>She now has 380 varieties of rice seeds alone. There are something like 200,000 people benefiting from 34 similar community seed banks set up in 13 states across the country. The banks are seen as an insurance against changing conditions, such as climate, new pests or consumer demand. People who receive the seeds pay nothing for them, and in return pledge to continue to save and share them. \"Indiscriminate use of chemicals has harmed the soil to an enormous extent,\" Devi says, \"but we can still restore fertility and conserve water if we act now.\"</p><p>The work is backed by Dr Debal Deb, an ecologist who has established the only gene bank of indigenous rice in India. The Green Revolution was environmentally disastrous in India, he says: \"In the 80s, the drastic erosion of the genetic diversity of rice and other crops was irreversible. Thousands of rice varieties no longer exist in the farms where they evolved over centuries. They are extinct for good and not even accessed in the national and international gene banks.\" This, he says, translates into a threat to the country's food security.</p><p>Collecting seeds from a large and diverse country such as India is no easy task. \"I depend on the traditional knowledge of the farmers and go to different corners in the region in search of new varieties,\" Devi says. \"The farmers explain the qualities of a particular strain and how to cultivate them. We then collect the seed, cultivate it on an experimental basis and note down the results. If it is satisfactory, we distribute it among the other farmers. We also need to sow the seeds regularly to continue with the strain. Today, traditional knowledge is almost lost in the euphoria over new varieties.\"</p><p><strong>Pan Yue<br/>Environmental adviser</strong></p><p>Arguably, the best news of 2007 was a promise by China, the world's biggest polluter, to blaze a greener path of development rather than follow in our filthy footsteps. One of the worst was the attempted sidelining of the man who has done more than anyone to secure that promise. Pan Yue, 47, deputy director of the state environmental protection administration, has become a hero for his willingness to stand up to corporations and local governments that jeopardise public health in the rush for economic growth. In so doing, he has won the ear of the PM and president, whose political mantra of \"scientific development\" emphasises the need for sustainable, not just rapid, growth, and has helped set ambitious energy efficiency and pollution controls targets.</p><p>All this has made him some powerful enemies, particularly in energy, steel and construction, who seemed to have won a victory over Pan late last year at the 17th Communist Party Congress where more business-oriented cadres were promoted, but Pan was left a deputy director and must now fight for his political life.</p><p>Even so, Pan's warnings that the economic miracle will end soon because the environment can no longer keep pace have goaded China's leadership into action. He has also warned that 26% of the water in the seven biggest river systems is so polluted that it has \"lost the capacity for basic ecological function\".</p><p>The International Energy Agency estimates that China will overtake the US as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases by the end of next year - some say it's already done so. In November, China belatedly released a five-year plan for environmental protection, for the first time mentioning the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but it gave no targets or deadlines for doing so. \"Currently the conflicts between China's economic and social development and its limited environmental resources are getting more and more serious each day,\" the paper said.</p><p>Pan Yue is on the frontline of that conflict. Given its global importance, the world - as well as China - needs him to succeed. </p><p><strong>Ma Jun <br/>Writer and activist</strong></p><p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-332257021'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/01/04/majun.jpg' alt='Ma Jun's book China's Water Crisis' width='220' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure>Ma Jun, 39, became an environmentalist in 1997 after hearing Chinese engineers boast that the Yellow River was a model of water management, even though he knew it was so over-dammed and exploited that it failed to reach the sea on more than 200 days each year. Now he is one of a growing number of people challenging the Chinese culture of official secrecy and saving face. His website names and shames companies and local governments that violate environmental standards, and the former journalist has called to account corporate executives and Communist party cadres with pollution maps. Ma Jun set up the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, which cooperates with the central government in a non-confrontational - but highly pragmatic - campaign strategy. Despite the tight controls imposed on independent organisations by the Communist party, there are now 3,000 registered green NGOs, up from fewer than 50 five years ago.   </p><p><strong>Michael Fay<br/> Conservationist</strong></p><p> In 1999 Michael Fay, an American, set off on a 15-month 2,000-mile expedition to cross the forests of Gabon. He returned with an extraordinary set of pictures and visited President Bongo of Gabon in his New York hotel room. \"I showed him pictures of surfing hippos, gorillas in clearings, elephants in the forest and gorillas and chimpanzees caressing their young. The president was transported into the computer. He was there. You could see right away that he was completely blown away by what he saw. He kept asking his foreign minister, 'How come I don't know about these things? We must act quickly.' He said, 'We're going to do something dramatic.' \" Bongo set up 13 new national parks, covering more than 10,000 sq miles, thus immediately protecting 10% of the country. Fay, 51, continues to press for conservation in central Africa.   </p><p><strong>Guy Lamstaes<br/> Inventor</strong></p><p> Guy Lamstaes and colleagues have invented a way to make fridges far more energy-efficient. Barely a few inches across and made of wax, his device had little impact until last year, when it was reinvented as a simple way to reduce household and industrial emissions. Now called the eCube, the box has taken sectors of British industry by storm, and is now doing the same in the US. It won't save the planet, but it offers a perfect example of the simple steps that can make a difference. The cube mimics food and fits around a fridge's sensor, which usually measures the temperature of the circulating air. Because air heats up more quickly than yoghurt, milk or whatever else is stored inside, this makes the fridge work harder than necessary. With the cube fitted, the fridge responds only to the food temperature, which means it turns on and off less often as the door is open and closed.   </p><p><strong>Jia Zhangke<br/> Actor/director</strong></p><p> Jia Zhangke, 37, is among the most prominent artists raising awareness about the environment. His film Still Life, which won the 2006 Golden Lion award at Venice, is a tale of social upheaval and ecological destruction set against the backdrop of the Three Gorges Dam in China - one of the world's biggest hydroelectric projects which has forced millions of people to move. It tells the story of a man and a woman who are searching for their spouses in a town that has been flooded by the rising waters of the mighty reservoir behind the barrier. The film was passed by the Chinese censors despite its portrayal of official corruption, land seizures and thuggish violence. This is the best-known cinematic critique of the ecological destruction in China, but many other artists and film-makers are now addressing the problems of the country's breakneck race for economic growth.   </p><p><strong>Bunker Roy<br/> Educationalist</strong></p><p> Bunker Roy, 62, set up the Barefoot College in India, the only school in the world known to be open only to people without any formal education. Roy's idea is that India and Africa are full of people with skills, traditional knowledge and practical resourcefulness who are not recognised as engineers, architects or water experts but who can bring more to communities than governments or big businesses. The college trains the poor to combine local knowledge with new green technologies : 15,000 people have learned to become \"barefoot\" water and solar engineers, architects and teachers. It has helped hundreds of communities across India - and now in seven other countries - install water supplies and solar voltaic lighting systems, develop bicycles that can cross rivers and design buildings that collect every drop of water.   </p><p><strong>Olav Kårstad<br/> Chemical Engineer</strong></p><p> Olav Kårstad, 59, is the world's leading collector and storer of carbon dioxide. He works for Norwegian oil company Statoil which, rather than pay a carbon tax on the 1m tonnes of CO2 it produces a year, has learned to compress it into liquid form, transport it by pipeline out to sea and then inject it into deep, porous rocks, instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The plan now is to collect the exhaust gases of power stations. This could save 90% of CO2 emissions, but the snag is that it costs hundreds of millions of pounds for every station and it uses as much as 35% more energy to collect the gas, transport it and bury it. But many oil and power companies, as well as the UK, US and Australian governments, are now plunging billions of dollars into the technology which they hope will provide them with a carbon \"get out of jail\" card within 10 years.   </p><p><strong>Cormac McCarthy<br/> Writer</strong></p><p> The Road, by the 74-year-old American writer Cormac McCarthy, imagines a father and his son trudging south through a landscape where nature and civilisation are in their death throes. It's oppressive, horrifying and poetic, and is widely seen as both a parable and the logical extension of the earth's physical degeneration. His predictions may be scientifically fanciful, but the book, published last year, may have far more influence in the next 30 years than any number of statistics and fro nt line reports. It was nominated by George Monbiot, who says, \"It could be the most important environmental book ever. It is a thought experiment that imagines a world without a biosphere, and shows that everything we value depends on the ecosystem.\"</p><p><strong>Peter Head<br/>Civil engineer</strong></p><p>Peter Head, 60, is an unlikely man to be leading a cultural revolution. The soft-spoken Englishman, a director of Arup and one of the world's leading bridge builders, is now the master planner of the world's first true eco city.</p><p>His brief from the Shanghai city authorities may have been simple, but in building and design terms it was the equivalent of a moonshot: to build on an island at the mouth of the Yangtze a city for 500,000 people that can lead the world's fastest growing economy out of the industrial age into the ecological one. Dongtan will cost $50bn or more, and be a prototype for 400 or more similar Chinese cities over the next 30 years.</p><p>Nothing like this has been tried before, Head says. \"It's a complete paradigm shift. It is to be three, four or five times an ecological improvement on anything that exists. China is trying to use ecological efficiency to detach resource use from economic growth, the traditional development path. It's a different way of thinking. They believe a new economic model will come out of it.\"</p><p>Dongtan will be all but self-sufficient, powered by wind, wood and sun. Its cars will be electric or hydrogen-fuelled, and its buildings will be mini power stations. There will be no landfill sites and 80% of waste will be recycled. Enough local food will be grown to supply much of the city's needs. Turf-covered rooftops will collect, filter and store water, and solar panels will heat it; wind turbines will provide nearly 20% of its energy needs.</p><p>\"China came to us with the idea. I was shocked by the scale of their ambition but they're deadly serious. Every province in China is building a demonstration eco city like this.\"</p><p>Other countries are catching up, too, and Head sees a 21st-century revolution gathering pace: \"We will look back on Dongtan and say it was a pretty crude effort, but it will be seen as a first step. It's significant but it's nothing like the answer. What will develop over the coming years is an 'ecological systems approach' to cities, one that uses nature to get us out of the mess we're in.\"</p><p>&#149; Words by John Vidal, David Adam, Peter Huck, Jonathan Watts, Leo Hickman, Philip Oltermann, Ian Sample and Aditya Ghosh</p><p><strong>&#183;</strong> The following clarification was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday January 26 2008.

A booming economy, a mobile phone for every man, woman and child, a robust and lively press. It is a tragedy for the country and the whole of Africa that a few days <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/kenya/story/0,,2233659,00.html\">after Kenya's elections</a>, curfews are being imposed, gangs of young men are fighting on the streets, security police and storming through slums looking for agitators and disfigured corpses are being discovered around the country. As ever, there is a sense that all this bloodshed could have been averted if only politicians had stepped down when their time has passed.</p><p>Mwai Kibaki <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/kenya/story/0,,2233630,00.html\">should have been</a> president of Kenya 15 years ago. In his prime, as vice president in Moi's government and later as leader of a new opposition party, he was seen as a real intellectual heavyweight - one of the few Kenyan politicians who understood finance and economics.</p><p>A rough rule of thumb in Africa is that if you are already in power, you can expect to win the next election, and Moi managed to keep his former colleague and rival out of power until he was constitutionally obliged to step down in 2002. By this time, Kibaki was old, unwell and depended too heavily on his cabal of ministers and advisers to prop him up.</p><p>Nonetheless, Kenya had high hopes when Kibaki finally moved into the presidential office in December 2002. Kenyan politics is still defined by tribe, and although Kibaki belonged to the dominant Kikuyu tribe, he had formed an alliance with <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7068055.stm\">Raila Odinga</a>, who delivered the votes of the rival Luo and promised a new era of post-tribal politics in Kenya.</p><p>A few years down the line, Kibaki's government was a partial success. The economy was growing at 5% a year, telecoms and technology has transformed the lives of both elites and the poor. But corruption, the disease that has blighted Kenyan politics, crept back in as ministers began siphoning off public funds and awarding contracts to suspect companies, confident that their president was too weak or ineffectual to stop them. And with corruption came the desire to stay in power, to protect the ill-gotten wealth and avoid prosecution. Old tribal rivalries began to creep in, too. Masai leaders urged their community to take land back from Kikuyu settlers, and Raila Odinga found himself marginalised within the government.</p><p>In 2005, the government held a referendum to strengthen the role of president. Enraged, Raila Odinga left the cabinet and set up a rival coalition to campaign for a no vote and won. In the euphoria of the victory, he set up a rival party, the <a href=\"http://www.odmk.org/\">Orange Democratic Movement</a>, to compete in last week's elections.</p><p>He is now right to be furious at the way the election <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0,,2233591,00.html\">has been run</a>. When he campaigned in the impoverished Muslim coastal areas, pro-government forces accused him of pandering to Islamists. The electoral roll is a sham - in Kibaki's own constituency 140,000 votes were cast even though only 70,000 people are registered to vote.</p><p>On Sunday, Kibaki declared a victory and swore in his government with indecent haste, ignoring EU observers' unhappiness about the way the elections were held and votes were counted. The cabal of ministers around him would have known full well that Kibaki's actions would bring people out onto the streets, and that clashes between rival political groups would turn violent. The irresponsibility and cynicism of Kenya's leaders over the last year is a betrayal of the people who voted them in five years ago with glad hearts.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/31/apeoplebetrayed","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/31/apeoplebetrayed","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Lost data and late gifts","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-24T10:51:13Z","sectionId":"news","id":"news/2007/dec/24/wrap.rostaylor","fields":{"body":"The Wrap will be taking a break until January 2.

But more on that - and the Queen's YouTube channel - later. Christmas Eve it may be, but the papers are not short of news stories.<P>The discovery that yet another slew of data has gone missing leaves the Mail asking, again, whether the government can be trusted to administer a national identity register - or indeed the planned NHS database. This time, nine health trusts have lost discs and memory sticks containing \"sensitive information\".<P>Meanwhile, the Times' splash says the NHS in England has wasted &#163;2bn over the past five years in its efforts to cut waiting times in accident and emergency wards. In order to meet the four-hour waiting time target, patients are admitted to hospital \"just in case\". \"Many are later discharged the same day, suggesting they had no real need to be admitted,\" the paper says. Each admission can cost up to &#163;1,000.<P>The paper says that in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the target does not exist, far fewer people are admitted and discharged on the same day - and in Wales, where the target has recently been introduced, the numbers who spend just a few hours as in-patients are beginning to rise. \"It is a sick system which encourages hospitals to admit in haste with the expense borne at leisure,\" the Times says.<P>The Telegraph's splash claims the government is diverting cash for deprived schools to Labour-held constituencies at the expense of the rest.<P>Elsewhere, the Guardian reports that the government has all but abandoned the \"Respect agenda\" championed by Tony Blair. Louise Casey, who headed it, has been moved to a job looking at community policing. The paper says Gordon Brown's allies believe the agenda \"produced a distorted and negative image of British youth\".

Narendra Modi's victory was \"a stunning defeat for the country's governing Congress party and signaled that Modi and his charismatic, often pugnacious, brand of Hindu supremacist politics will be a force to be reckoned with in the future.\"<P>Election number three took place in Thailand. The People Power party, which backed the ousted PM Thaksin Shinawatra, won the parliamentary elections yesterday. Thaksin cannot return as PM because he is no longer an MP.

Many parcels were addressed to \"a soldier serving in Afghanistan\". So generous were the general public that the 7,200 men and women will receive two parcels each.<P>Back to the Times' worries about faith in an age of atheism - worries that persist despite the surge in church attendance among Polish Catholics living in Britain. (The Church of England denied yesterday that more people would attend RC mass than Anglican services this Christmas.)<P>\"The new militant atheism is wrong,\" the Times declares. \"It is totalitarian in its prescription for human happiness. It would deny as unscientific the spiritual dimension that is as truly Darwinian in its evolution and persistence as patterns of behaviour or genetics.

He has died after a short illness at the age of 88.<P>Donald began his career in geophysics when the subject was still only a minor component of earth science courses in British universities. In 1955 he started what became an internationally renowned MSc course at Birmingham University to meet the growing demand for trained manpower resulting from the advances in our understanding of how the Earth works and the development of the methodology for the exploration for raw materials. His own work included an investigation of the deep structure and tectonic history of two complex contrasting geological regions, the Scotia Arc in the south Atlantic and the Rift Valley in Kenya.<P>Donald was born in Manchester into a family with a love of chamber music and literature, both of which delighted him. He was educated at William Hulme grammar school, read geology at Manchester University, was a conscientious objector during the second world war, and interrupted university studies to work at the North Mosley mine in Lancashire. In 1950, during this experiment, the experience helped to test the ideas of physics Nobel laureate Patrick Blackett on the origin of the Earth's magnetic field, which required measurements at a mine.<P>Donald's geophysical interests started after he graduated in 1949 with first-class honours. At the end of an assistant lectureship at Manchester, he was appointed to start geophysics in the geology department at Birmingham University in 1950 - against the advice of his professor, Sir William Pugh. Donald was promoted to professor of geophysics at Birmingham in 1963, one of the first such appointments in a UK geology department. He continued his work on earth magnetism with his lifelong friend, collaborator and brother-in-law, the Cambridge physicist Roy King, whom he recruited for fieldwork in Sweden and who later became a reader in geophysics at Birmingham. This was also the opportunity to begin the department's long interest in the deep structure of north Wales, combining gravity and magnetic surveys with seismic investigations both on- and offshore with Derek Blundell.<P>Donald had always wanted to do geophysical work in the south Atlantic and was quick to become involved when the director of the Falklands Islands dependencies survey, the late Sir Vivian Fuchs, set up the Antarctic geology group at Birmingham in the 1950s. Work continued for 25 years, assisted and eventually led by Peter Barker, who moved with the Antarctic group to the British Antarctic survey in Cambridge. The achievements of the project over an area of more than 1m square miles underlain by complex geology at a time of rapidly developing ideas and technology were substantial.<P>The plate tectonic hypothesis gave a new significance to another major earth structure which had fascinated geologists and geophysicists since the end of the 19th century - east Africa's Great Rift Valley, now mooted as the site of incipient continental break-up. A start had been made in 1965 to determine the deep structure of the Rift by one of Donald's former students (and co-writer of this piece) Aftab Khan, newly appointed to start geophysics at Leicester University. From 1967 onwards, our joint work in often remote and inaccessible areas of east Africa revealed that the rift axis is underlain at shallow depth in the mantle by low seismic velocities attributable to high temperatures from thermal upwelling, actively extending the system in a similar manner to the mid-ocean ridges.<P>Donald was a wonderful raconteur and wit, loved by colleagues, friends and students. A dedicated teacher, he lacked vanity and was always prepared to \"muck in\". Geophysical field camps in Wales, Sweden, east Africa and elsewhere were run as family affairs, extended to include colleagues and students inspired by his enthusiasm for science and his enormous sense of fun.<P>His contributions to research and education in geophysics were recognised by awards from the Geological Society of London and the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers. He is survived by his wife Jean, whom he married in 1946, their daughter Bronwen and son Geoffrey.<P><b>&#183; </b>Donald Harrison Griffiths, geophysicist, born September 20 1919; died October 8 2007"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/dec/14/guardianobituaries.obituaries","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/news/2007/dec/14/guardianobituaries.obituaries","sectionName":"Science"},{"webTitle":"Every reason for optimism","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-05T10:21:34Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2007/dec/05/bali.climatechange","fields":{"body":"<p>As ministers from more than 180 countries meet in Bali this week for perhaps the most crucial round of climate change talks, the discussions are pivoting on impacts, adaptation and the urgent need for a post-2012 regime to reduce emissions. The role of forests and carbon markets and the need to finance a transfer of clean and green technology from the north to the south are also high on the agenda.</p><p>If governments rise to their responsibilities, vulnerable communities from Bangladesh to Barbados will have cause to celebrate. It will also mean a transition to a low-carbon society, new industries and a different way of doing business on this planet, and that means jobs.</p><p>The employment potential of combating climate change and of climate-proofing economies is only now coming to the fore. These are jobs not for just the middle classes, but also in a range of work from construction and agriculture to engineering and transport.</p><p>A study by the US-based Management Information Services estimated that in 2005 the environmental industry in the US generated more than 5.3m jobs, over $340bn (&pound;165bn) in sales and $47bn in tax revenue, and employed 10 times more workers than the pharmaceutical industry. In June this year, Eaga, which improves the energy efficiency of UK homes, floated on the London stock exchange. It employs 4,000 people in one of the UK's former coal-mining regions. </p><p>A new report by the UN Environment Programme's (Unep) sustainable energy finance initiative estimates that investment in renewables has reached $100bn, and now represents 18% of new investments in the power sector. </p><p>Hansen, a wind power gearbox maker owned by the Indian company Suzlon, has just built a factory in Tianjin, China, which will employ 600 people, and is building another in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, which will employ 800. New Delhi is introducing new eco-friendly compressed natural gas buses, which will create 18,000 jobs. </p><p>Direct employment in tourism in Kenya - mainly based on wildlife, national parks and landscapes - is about 200,000. The wider impact on the economy and employment is estimated to be far greater. </p><p>About 80% of young people questioned for a new survey in the US were interested in jobs that had a positive impact on the environment, and more than 90% said they would choose to work for environmentally friendly and socially responsible firms. A survey of workers in Brazil, China, Germany, India, the UK and the US found that employees who perceived their companies as socially responsible were happier and more likely to stay. </p><p>Roland Berger, a consultancy in Munich, estimates that in Germany in 2020 more people will be employed in environmental technology industries than in the car industry. Working Capital, a financial report from Unep, says the market providing finance for clean and renewable energy could reach $1.9 trillion by 2020. </p><p>A report by one of the world's largest law firm concludes that, in key cases, the investment community has the legal responsibility to incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment decisions, and a Unep meeting this year in Brazil concluded that both institutional investors and \"high net-worth individuals\" were progressively realising the importance of ESG-inclusion in long-term investment. </p><p>Kyoto's clean development mechanism could send $100bn from north to south for investment in carbon offsetting projects, such as renewable energy schemes and tree planting. An alliance of tropical forest countries is pressing for standing forests to be included in the carbon markets, which could generate jobs in conservation and tourism, and several countries, including Costa Rica, Norway and New Zealand, have pledged carbon neutrality, which will create more jobs. </p><p>In the wider landscape, more creative market mechanisms are emerging, such as payment for ecosystem services: power companies with hydroelectric stations are paying farmers and communities to maintain forests and soil upstream in Costa Rica and Kenya, for example. With debt-for-nature swaps, countries have some debts cancelled, and some of the savings are invested in conservation and the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems.</p><p>More than 20 states and some 300 cities in the US have adopted renewable energy standards and/or emission reduction targets in line with the Kyoto protocol. </p><p>Last week, the National Development and Reform Commission and the commerce ministry in China announced bans and restrictions on foreign investment in mining and some energy sectors. </p><p>In a recent report, US economist Roger Bezdek concluded that, with the right government incentives and investment in research and development, renewable energy and energy-efficiency industries could create 40m jobs in the US by 2030. </p><p>Clearly, we stand on the edge of something quite exciting and transformational.

For a man who had been bitten by a boa constrictor only a week before - in the Amazon, not Wiltshire - he certainly seemed at ease with himself and the world. In fact, he exuded an inner calm, something that our noisy group could hardly claim. </p><p>\"That,\" said Max gently, \"was like a herd of buffaloes approaching.\" He looked up at the trees. \"Notice how the birds have all stopped singing?\"</p><p>We stood in silence and slowly the birdsong resumed. </p><p>\"I want you all to go into the woods,\" Max went on. \"Find a tree away from the others and sit down. You can scratch and fidget for 30 seconds, then you stop. Sit absolutely still. Empty your mind. Zone-in. Meditate. I'll call you in after 20 minutes.\"</p><p>I took a grassy track that led away to the right, angling through tall oaks and then stands of smaller trees. After about 100 yards I cut to the right and sat down. Within two minutes I'd stopped scratching. My breathing slowed. </p><p>A squirrel ran up to me. I came back into focus. My hearing had become super-sensitive. I could hear the wasps in the tree-tops, even a falling leaf as it tickled its way through the foliage to land on my knee. A pheasant stepped past me. I could have easily reached out and grabbed it, but I was stone-like, utterly still. I felt I would never move, that I could stay like this forever. I was becoming a part of the woods.</p><p>Born in Zambia, Ian \"Max\" Maxwell worked in Kenya on poacher-defences, then later with the American special forces, the Shadow Wolves, a team entirely manned by Native Americans. On the Mexican border, they track drug smugglers and illegal immigrants. \"They taught me to track fast,\" he says of that period in his life. \"And treat the people we caught with compassion.\"</p><p>Now living in Cornwall, he's become the man police turn to when there's a tricky murder enquiry in the woods, or a fugitive out there. He also runs Shadowhawk, a Devon-based company that teaches tracking to anyone who is interested. And that doesn't just mean men who prefer to wear camouflage. The chief instructors include Rhoda Watkins, who combines yoga and tracking. There are also courses for children.</p><p>\"Tracking brings any environment alive,\" Max says, \"whether it's desert, jungle or a British back garden. Anyone can benefit from that. The zone-in is certainly a very moving experience.\"</p><p>My own moment of ecstatic woodland appreciation had lasted well, but then Max's distant voice ended it: \"Come on in!\" We moved back quietly, without quick movements, and Max nodded. \"That's better - now you're ready to track.\"</p><p>We divided into two groups and set off. I was with Max's colleague, Nick Mayell, who took us down to a stream and then along the bank. After a few yards he stopped and pointed out a shallow depression on a mud bank. \"Mink. Smaller print than an otter and the feet aren't webbed.\" He glanced around and spotted something else. \"A roe deer has crossed here.\" A small hoof print just over an inch across. We moved on another yard. \"Badger - oh, and a rat.\" This innocuous patch of woodland was suddenly rather interesting. These marks were the start of trails, each one a story we might follow.</p><p>After our three-hour session was over, I asked him whether tracking was as good an experience in tame old England as it is in Africa? \"Absolutely,\" he said. \"Try the zone-in every day. Find a spot in a wood where you can be alone. Do the meditation, start tracking - it can change your life.\"</p><p>Well, I have to admit, it was the first time I had sat still in a British wood for more than five minutes, and it had been a wonderful experience.

Instead, what he's likely to face is some intense presidential lobbying that will range from the privately furious to the deeply anxious. What threatens to ambush Brown at the ceremonials is a trade deal with the European Union that has come seriously unstuck. In the next few days the pressure will be on Peter Mandelson, the European trade commissioner, to convince trade ministers he can extricate the EU from a very tight corner and what could be a public relations disaster.<P>At stake are the millions of jobs and thousands of companies in 76 of the poorest countries in the world that depend on exports to the EU. Kenya's horticultural industry, for instance, which lands beans on your plate and carnations on your dinner table. It's a sector worth $700m in foreign exchange to Kenya, but come January, Kenya could face a 10% to 20% hike in tariffs on all its exports to the EU, and that could be sufficient to bankrupt some of its most successful export companies, carefully nurtured through aid programmes - including those of the UK. It could be a story replicated across the globe from Lesotho to Namibia, from Papua New Guinea to the Pacific island of Vanuatu, from the Caribbean to Mozambique. The commission would stand accused of slamming the first tariff increase in more than 40 years on some of the least developed countries in the world.<P>This would hardly make for flattering headlines. The EU likes to claim credentials for promoting development, and it would wake up to a nasty new year hangover as the villain of the piece. The tempo of negotiations to avoid this is becoming increasingly fraught as EU trade negotiators bully and cajole their counterparts in developing countries. The EU insists it has just six weeks to stitch together hugely complex trade deals; developing countries are furious that they are being rushed into agreements that will have far-reaching consequences for their economies.<P>So how did this pickle come about? How does trade policy end up being made on the hoof like this? Cast your mind back to 2005, and the talk during that year was that trade was as crucial as aid and debt relief to the long-term development of poor countries. The UK's Department for International Development made \"fighting poverty through trade\" part of its mission statement. But trade proved the failure of 2005, the Doha round of the World Trade Organisation talks ended in stalemate. The fallout of that failure to reform key rules of the WTO is now being felt, as the EU presses on to implement what many argue shouldn't still be in the WTO rulebook.<P>The basis of the present mess is that 76 former colonies of European countries have for more than 40 years benefited from a system of preferential, lower tariffs on their exports to the EU: it was a small gesture of colonial guilt. By the mid-1990s, other developing countries which didn't have access to the system challenged it, and the WTO ruled it as discriminatory. The hunt was launched to replace it with a system that still benefited these former colonies but wasn't going to land the EU in breach of WTO rules. The WTO gave the EU until December 2007 to sort it out. Without a deal, these countries would be subject to tariffs on their exports.<P>Fair enough, but the sting was that the new system - Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) - had to meet the WTO requirement for reciprocity: what had started out as the EU doing some poor countries a favour became a trade deal in which the EU was given duty-free access to the markets of developing countries. In return for its generosity, the EU would get a handsome dose of trade liberalisation.<P>Needless to say this agenda, which has been energetically pursued by the EU's small army of trade negotiators, has made plenty of developing countries very jumpy - and has made campaigning groups extremely suspicious. They fear that this is an instance of how the old trade liberalisation agenda that achieved notoriety in Seattle in 1999 is reappearing through the back door; the US and the EU are skirting the much higher profile negotiations in the WTO to use bilateral negotiations that barely surface on the media radar in order to achieve the same objectives - market access for their companies<P>For the developing countries herded into six regional negotiating blocs, the EPAs have become a nightmare. They have a Damoclean sword hanging over their heads in the form of the December deadline, with all the economic disruption and chaos that would entail, but they also have deep anxieties about what they're being rushed into agreeing.<P>There are three big concerns on EPAs. First, every developed country has used tariff protection in its history to develop industry, but EPAs restrict that capability and could unleash a surge in European imports that could wipe out fledgling industries such as Kenya's dairy sector, as well as undercut prices of agricultural products. Second, governments themselves stand to lose a major chunk of their revenue that comes from tariffs; for instance, Zambia would lose $15.8m - the equivalent of its annual HIV/Aids budget. EU assurances that there would be aid to compensate only underline how this would increase dependency on aid. Third, the most complex and most important issue of all is how EPAs will affect regional trade. If you can get cheap widgets from the EU, why bother importing from your neighbour in Africa or the Pacific? UN studies have indicated that EPAs could lead to contraction in exactly those low and medium technology industries that are the basis for successful industrialisation.<P>The stakes are too big to rush into this, insist a growing chorus of voices in the developing world that are demanding to know why exactly this is the one WTO deadline the EU is insisting must be met. There are plenty of ways to postpone the deadline, but having snarled up the negotiations in unnecessary complications, the commission is now using the deadline as \"a battering ram\", as one of those involved put it. There are plenty of rumours of heavy lobbying of individual governments - \"We just talked to them as a friend of what was in their best interests,\" said one official of recent discussions with Ghana, hotly denying any suggestion that this amounted to lobbying. And there have been squeals of outrage from the Pacific, where a commission email seemed to tie future promises of aid explicitly to getting an EPA signed.<P>It sounds grim. One of the biggest economic trading blocs in the world, on which the fortunes of many of these 76 countries are entirely dependent through both aid and trade, and here it is behaving like a bully-boy in the playground. But its bad behaviour is all behind closed doors; the arm-twisting is behind the bike shed, to play out the metaphor. International trade is such a complex subject and public attention so fleeting and rare that the EU is gambling on getting away with it. <P><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@guardian.co.uk\">m.bunting@guardian.co.uk</a>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/19/comment.uganda","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/19/comment.uganda","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Ghana to UK: the new trail of misery","webPublicationDate":"2007-11-11T18:44:48Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2007/nov/11/drugsandalcohol.internationalcrime","fields":{"body":"<b>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday November 18 2007</b><br><br>In the article below we quoted Stephen Jakobi as a spokesman for Fair Trials Abroad, but he retired as director in June last year.

Behind him, on the palm-tree fringed beach of Prampram village, dozens of colourfully painted longboats make land; the bulky wooden vessels heaved and roped out of the roaring West Atlantic by slender teenage boys.<P>'There are many other couriers here in Ghana; some have made a dozen journeys to London and Amsterdam. You can see the benefit it has brought to their families, even here in our village. Their mothers have stopped working; some have motorbikes and have bought fishing boats. Some have also died. A schoolfriend of mine swallowed over 50 condoms and died within an hour. He dipped the condoms in honey and they ruptured. He was foolish; the condoms were local, not imported.' Kawko gestures to where his youngest son is playing in the sea with a yellow plastic oil drum. 'I wouldn't want this life for him.'<P>Over the past few years a concerted shift in trafficking routes has transformed West African countries like Ghana, Senegal and Guinea Bissau into volatile hubs for cocaine smuggled from South America to a booming European market. Using sophisticated transportation networks and the latest communication technology to elude woefully inept coastguards, Colombian traffickers are establishing transit areas along the Gulf of Guinea that can only worsen lawlessness in countries already overwhelmed by crime, poverty and instability.<P>For locals the route opens up a risky but tempting way out of poverty. A single flight to Amsterdam from Ghana, via Morocco, earlier this year carried 32 West Africans, all of whom had swallowed cocaine packets or concealed them in their luggage. Impatient with the increasing arrest rates of mules, the South American cartels have recruited London-based Nigerians and Ghanaians to scour Britain's capital for gullible teenage drug couriers.<P>Last week two teenagers were seized at Accra airport, en route for London Gatwick. The 16- and 19-year-olds, both Lithuanian boys living in south London, were arrested under the British-led Operation Westbridge, a joint project by HM Revenue & Customs iand the Ghanaian authorities to catch drug smugglers using Accra as a gateway to the UK. The pair were allegedly caught with nearly four kilos of cocaine ingested in around 16 condoms.<P>It came after July's seizure of 16-year-old London schoolgirls Yasemin Vatansever and Yutunde Diya, who were stopped leaving the country allegedly carrying &pound;300,000 of cocaine hidden in laptop bags. A narcotics officer who interrogated the girls claimed the teenagers knew exactly what they were coming to do in Ghana. They were, he claimed, 'classic mules' recruited in London to come to Ghana and pick up the bags for a fee of &pound;3,000. Up to 60 mules a week are estimated to arrive in Britain from the region.<P>The rain falls heavily on the bumpy road to Kumasi, churning it to red slushy mud. Here, 50km from the Ghanaian capital, Accra, is Nswana Prison. For its two recent occupants, Vatansever and Diya, the international fight against South American drug cartels is of little concern. The girls, who had told their parents they were going on a school trip to France before flying to Ghana, fit the classic drug mule profile - young, poor and gullible. They have spent most of their time in isolation. In the past fortnight Vatansever is believed to have contracted malaria.<P>Conditions inside the high-walled compound are grim. Each day the inmates are employed in hard labour, building an irrigation plant. The cramped cells often fit as many as a dozen prisoners, who share toilet facilities. Disease and violence are rampant. For the past few days, officials have been temporarily holding the teenagers at Ghana's Narcotics Control Board, on the top floor of the innocuous office block. After reaching the floor where the girls were held, The Observer was turned back by a machine-gun toting guard. The girls, he said, were well. We heard them shouting from their makeshift cells.<P>The trial of the British schoolgirls will resume in Ghana this week and both are expected to be sentenced to up to five years in prison. They are being tried under Ghana's Juvenile Justice Act, meaning that their trial must be completed within six months and they can only be held on remand for three months.<P>The girls 'vigorously deny' the charges, according to Fair Trials Abroad, which helped to find lawyers for the pair and has been liaising with the families and the Foreign Office.<P>Fair Trials Abroad lawyer Stephen Jakobi, says the case bears striking similarities to that of two Birmingham teenagers who were jailed in Thailand after being found with &pound;4m worth of heroin. Karyn Smith, 18, and 17-year-old Patricia Cahill spent three years in the infamous 'Bangkok Hilton' prison before being pardoned in 1993. They claimed they were forced to confess by Thai police, who planted drugs on them to claim reward money.<P>Jakobi said: 'You've got two very young girls going through an airport where they were bound to get caught. There are lots of parallels, and it seems to me extremely probable that these girls were being used as decoys. As there were British officers involved in their arrest it would have made sense to allow them through to Britain and arrest them there, not leave them in Ghana.'<P>Almost all of the Ghana-based mules used by drugs gangs are poor and willing to risk not only their liberty but their lives for less than &pound;500. The mules are all paid an initial fee, sometimes as low as &pound;50, with the rest payable upon a successful handover. If they are arrested, they will not get paid and the debts they left behind will be passed on to family members.<P>According to Tony Walker, Revenue & Customs head of operations, the region is of increasing concern to the British authorities. 'The air courier route from West Africa, either directly to the UK or in transit through other EU airports, is a specific threat,' he said. 'The use of such young people in smuggling drugs demonstrates the ruthless nature of those criminal gangs involved in the illegal narcotics trade and the misery they cause.'<P>As well as providing a number of British undercover operatives on the ground Operation Westbridge has supplied technical and operational expertise to the Ghanaians. Since November 2006, Westbridge has made 122 interceptions, seizing 356kg of cocaine, 2,275kg of cannabis and 1.3kg of heroin. It follows the success of Operation Airbridge, a joint UK-Jamaican initiative to catch drugs couriers with internal concealments before they board planes from Jamaica.<P>But there are fears that without the full-time aid of a British task force, local authorities will be unable to cope: 'The British have only left a small team behind,' one Ghanaian Customs Office said: 'We have some equipment on loan but our surveillance experience is minimal. We don't have sniffer dogs, we don't have enough scanners; it is all about profiling and gathering intelligence and we need the British to attain that, not just temporary assistance.'.'<P>Harvested in the foothills of the Andes in Colombia, Peru or Ecuador by cartels, the leaves of the coca plant are processed in laboratories using kerosene, methyl alcohol and sulphuric acid. The resulting powder is dried, cut into blocks and transferred to ports in Colombia and Venezuela, routinely these days, for shipment to West Africa. The cocaine is then cut into smaller amounts and sent on to Europe.<P>The US is the world's top market for cocaine, but use there is declining. In Europe, demand is rising. A kilo of cocaine brings about &pound;25,000 in Europe, compared with about half that in the US. London has become the centre of Europe's market. Not surprisingly the smuggling routes are as complex as they are diverse.<P>In April this year eight European nations, led by Britain, launched a military-law enforcement task force targeting cocaine traffic from Africa. The Maritime Analysis Operations Centre, based in Lisbon, teams police, navy and customs resources from across Europe, a model similar to Florida's Drug Enforcement Agency.<P>Because of historic ties to Latin America, the Iberian Peninsula remains a key gateway, with around 30 per cent of Britain's cocaine coming in through Spanish corridors. The drugs are stockpiled in West Africa and then moved to clandestine landing zones on the coasts of Spain and Portugal, or commercial ports such as Barcelona and Antwerp before reaching London in fishing vessels and commercial ship containers.<P>In September, the US DEA tipped off the Spanish coastguard to a ship from Venezuela hauling 15 tonnes of cocaine. The ship off-loaded four tonnes to a smaller vessel in the Atlantic. Spanish authorities intercepted the smaller load near Ibiza, where the cocaine had been transferred to fast boats operated by Bulgarians and Croatians. The Spaniards then caught up with the mother ship heading for Ghana.<P>Of particular concern to the DEA are Ghana and Guinea-Bissau. In Ghana, top officials were accused last year of protecting a Venezuelan drug lord. Ghanaian police recorded the continent's biggest cocaine bust last year, arresting Ghanaian and Nigerian suspects in a Mercedes van containing two tons of the drug concealed in boxes of fish.<P>Fronted by Colombian cartels, local gangsters in the region have even set up elaborate front companies which allegedly buy high-level protection for the business interests of their new South American partners. Most aren't difficult to spot. In Accra, Ghana's capital, BMWs, Mercedes and newly imported canary yellow Humvees stand out from the beaten and battered local taxis.<P>As an example of how high up the lure of drugs money reaches you only need look at the recent case of the Ghanaian MP Eric Amoateng. While serving in parliament, Amoateng sent 70kg of heroin, hidden in boxes of pottery, to the US and was arrested in January 2006 when he arrived at New York's JFK airport to collect it.<P>Narcotics seizures in West Africa jumped eightfold in 2006, according to the latest Europol statistics. But it said in a report last year that 'only a very small proportion of the cocaine passing through the continent is actually being seized'. Experts worry that traffickers could eventually smuggle in precursor chemicals and set up labs, enabling them to ship coca base across the Atlantic instead of the more expensive finished product.<P>At a recent major seminar on narcotics, attended by some of the world's leading law enforcement experts, the connection between West Africa and the scourge of drugs in Europe was spelled out.<P>One of the speakers, Karen Tandy, head of the DEA, said: 'Latin American gangs are setting up shop in Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau in the West and Kenya in the East. Africa has emerged as a real hotspot in just the past couple of years. Africa will become, in terms of a drugs hot-bed, one of our worst nightmares if we do not get ahead of that curve now.'"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/11/drugsandalcohol.internationalcrime","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2007/nov/11/drugsandalcohol.internationalcrime","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Review: The Decline and Fall of the British Empire by Piers Brendon","webPublicationDate":"2007-10-20T23:12:44Z","sectionId":"books","id":"books/2007/oct/21/historybooks.features","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>The Decline and Fall of the British Empire </strong></p><p>by Piers Brendon </p><p>Cape &#163;25, pp794</p><p>The British empire is a five-act drama whose complex denouement remains an inescapable feature of 21st-century life. Iraq, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Burma and Pakistan: each of these crises has its roots in the pax Britannica, a compelling mixture of tragedy and farce. But first, as a curtain-raiser, in the West, there was the great American experiment. Depending on your point of view, this matured or turned sour in the closing decades of the 18th century in a second act of British irresolution and incompetence. But it was a revolution. When the King's forces marched to the surrender ceremony at Yorktown in 1781, the regimental pipers played 'The World Turned Upside Down'.</p><p>After that, and more spectacular than any achievement in the New World, there was the empire of the East, from Cairo to Hong Kong, a sprawling, informal hegemony that encompassed about 11 million square miles and a quarter of mankind. This third act, what most people mean when they talk about the 'British empire', reached its gorgeous climax in the jubilee of 1897 when no fewer than 11 colonial Prime Ministers and any number of maharajahs preceded the Queen Empress to a thanksgiving service in St Paul's where, it was said, only the Almighty was superior. In a darker fourth act, this empire of 'British imperialism' lingered, still majestic, into the interwar years of 1919-39.</p><p>Finally, there is the 'self-liquidating concern', the late 20th-century empire in swift and, for its people, bewildering collapse, from Indian independence (1947) to the Hong Kong handover of 1997. Like Rome, this empire is now morphing from politics to culture. Thanks to technology and economics, it has done this on a scale unprecedented in human history. You could say that globalisation equals the English language plus Microsoft.</p><p>Piers Brendon's prodigious volume is a brilliant account of acts two, three and four in this swelling drama of imperial themes from Yorktown to Goose Green. Despite his title, he knows he is not Edward Gibbon and is the first to concede that Decline and Fall casts a long shadow. While he has resisted 'setting up as a rival' to the choleric county colonel and his rolling Augustan narrative of Roman decline, the awesome scale of a subject that includes Africa, the Far East and the Antipodes compels the faithful narrator into an enthralling mini-series of colonial adventure from Plessey to Omdurman, via the Zulu wars (Rorke's Drift) and Baden-Powell's defence of Mafeking.</p><p>Brendon's empire, about which he has mixed feelings, is a liberal enterprise dedicated, however hypocritically, to the principle of liberty. Although its antecedents trace back to the 16th century and beyond, this empire was inspired by the loss of the American colonies and the ancient rivalry with France. It was made possible by the supremacy of the Royal Navy, by Britain's industrial revolution, and by the relative weakness of rival European powers in the 19th century.</p><p>What a strange business it was. In an imperial protectorate like Egypt, which was ruled by Lord Cromer, the modernising momentum of empire transformed a rat- and cockroach-infested infrastructure into a kind of tourist theme park. Edwardian Cairo came to resemble an English town that preserved its character, it was said, 'much as the proprietor of a country place keeps a game preserve or a deer park for his own amusement'. Cromer, who was no fool, observed that the lazy Anglo-Saxon empire-builder was always in pursuit of two, mutually destructive, imperial ideals: the ideal of good government and British supremacy versus the ideal of self-government and Britain's abdication as a world power. In the end, through force of progress, the latter prevailed.</p><p>All that was to come. The triumphant Victorian, or second, British empire was also an astonishing pageant populated by larger-than-life players for whom the world was a barrel of oysters. Who could resist these imperialists? Whatever his inner reservations, Brendon is happily seduced by his subject. His book is stuffed with a myriad spectacular examples of human vanity, folly, depravity and greed - and is all the better for it.</p><p>Brendon has done impressive field research, especially in his scintillating chapters on the scramble for Africa. The Africa of the great imperialists like Rhodes, who modelled himself on the Romans, and was considered to be a kind of Caesar, has a cast of eccentrics and egomaniacs who seem, at times, beyond fiction. What moviemaker could dream up such an unscrupulous bully as journalist HM Stanley, worshipping Queen Victoria, the Great White Mother?</p><p>Or explorer Richard Burton, a man who saw trousers as a demoralising infringement of liberty and whose translation of The Arabian Nights included an essay on the Sotadic zone, where sensuality ran free and sodomy was 'popular and endemic'? Then there's Disraeli, the old wizard, silkily persuading his queen to admit the cannibals of Fiji to the empire on the grounds that they were 'all Methodists'. The Boer War was the apogee of this bizarre pageant: 'Bobs' Roberts toasting Kipling, General Buller's oxcarts of kitchen accessories and travelling iron bathroom; Kitchener sending telegrams from a stock of forms kept in his helmet; the War Office ordering the defence of landlocked Mafeking in the belief that 'it was the nearest port to Pretoria'.</p><p>The late Victorian novelists got the measure of this madness, from Conrad in Heart of Darkness to Rider Haggard in King Solomon's Mines and Henry James who, rather surprisingly, wrote in 1877 that 'the \"decline\" of England seems to me a tremendous and even, almost, an inspiring spectacle, and if the British empire is once more to shrink up into that plethoric little island, the process will be the greatest drama in history'.</p><p>And so it proved. The Great War, provoked by imperial rivalries, saw the end of many empires but, although it nearly bankrupted Britain, it also inspired a late, interwar swan song. Until 1939, despite predictions of decline, the British empire was still a colossus. Even Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf had to concede that Britain was still 'the greatest power on earth'.</p><p>If the First World War reduced the empire to a near-bankrupt charade, the Second World War, more genuinely global, finished it off completely. One of the many impressive things about this book is the way in which Brendon, having revelled in its bizarre and sometimes glorious excesses, does not flinch from the empire's less glamorous, and occasionally sordid, endgame in India, Kenya, Rhodesia and Suez.</p><p>He persuasively demonstrates that so much of the contemporary Middle East crisis can be laid at the door of the Foreign Office. For, as the imperial armies withdrew from India, Burma, Ceylon and Malaya, Britain tried to enhance its ascendancy in the Middle East. Eden declared the defence of the eastern Mediterranean 'a matter of life and death to the British empire', and this was a cross-party programme. Ernest Bevin was said to have dropped nothing from Eden's policy, except the aitches.</p><p>If Piers Brendon has a weakness, it lies in his insufficient attention to the role of America in Britain's decline. Dean Acheson's famous claim that 'Great Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role' is both a statement of fact and also a boastful assertion of late 20th-century American supremacy, however brief. Ironically, 1963, the year of Acheson's comment, was the year of the Beatles' first American tour and the beginnings of a new kind of Englishness, a global phenomenon but one unintelligible without an understanding of the empire. By 2007, Britain's role in the world seems to have become more loosely cultural than political.

Its headquarters are in Nairobi, Kenya and 97% of its staff are African.</p><p>Although its original and still core remit is improving health, Amref put together a development plan for Katine that is intended to deliver major improvements in every area — education, water and sanitation, farming and livelihoods and the governance of the community as well as the prevention and treatment of disease. Health-related issues underlie many of Katine's problems anyway. Unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation cause life-threatening diarrhoea in children and worsen endemic diseases such as malaria and HIV/Aids. Schools have few toilets and little education in hygiene and the avoidance of disease. Girls drop out of school, get pregnant young and stand a high chance of dying in childbirth. Inadequate nutrition caused by poverty renders people more vulnerable to sickness. </p><p>When the Guardian decided to look for a partner to help bring a community out of poverty and deprivation, Amref's proposals for Katine — an area of north-eastern Uganda which has had very little outside help — won it the paper's backing against competition from a number of aid agencies better known in the UK. </p><p>Joshua Kyallo, Uganda country director, based in Kampala, said they were excited by the scope of the project. \"We have a lot of models for health and school-based activities, for instance, but this is the first time we will be doing a project that is bringing all these different activities together,\" he said. \"It is breaking completely new ground. The project is going to be a model that Amref can use elsewhere.\"<br/> <br/>Importantly, Amref works primarily through the structures that exist within the community, such as parent-teacher associations in schools, local committees and elected councillors at all levels. The first stage of the project was to find out from local people what their needs and priorities were. \"Sustainable development is in the hands of communities,\" he said. Unless everyone is engaged and enthusiastic, the achievements of the three-year project will not last. </p><p>The Amref plan covers five areas — health, education, water and sanitation, livelihoods and governance. Katine village, an area of 1500 people, will be the main focus for the Guardian's interactive coverage but all 25,000 who live in Katine sub-county will benefit. Farm-Africa, a sister organisation of Amref with great experience in agricultural development, will run the livelihoods element. </p><h2>Read more about Amref's assessments and plans</h2><p>Katine Community Partnerships Project's Community Needs Assessment Overview: <a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2007/10/17/Amref_assessment.doc\">Word file</a></p><p>Katine Community Partnerships Project's Conceptual Framework report, September 25 2007: <a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2007/10/18/Amref_Katineplans.pdf\">PDF file</a></p><p>Amref UK homepage: <a href=\"http://uk.amref.org\">amref.org</a></p><h2>Health</h2><p>&#183; Train 66 volunteer village health teams who will be able to offer advice and help on family planning, sanitation, hygiene, HIV/Aids and offer immediate early treatment for malaria and diarrhoea and monitor those on TB drugs. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-331022240'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/10/17/katine.immunisation220.260.jpg' alt='Katine health centre: UNEPI immunisation program for babies ' width='220' height='260' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>UNEPI immunisation program at Katine health centre.

Russia, France and the Arabic world, through al-Jazeera, now have their own take on the world. If you add news and social networking websites then there is no shortage of global information out there.</p><p>But there is one yawning gap in this scenario - Africa. A continent of 53 nations and 10% of the world's population, yet it has no television news service to call its own. It relies on others to tell its story and that is frequently dictated by the latest outbreak of war, natural disaster or government strife, all helping to reinforce the notion that Africa is nothing but a basket case.</p><p>A new channel, A24, plans to change all that, mostly through the efforts of Salim Amin, the son of the late Mohamed Amin, a Kenyan cameraman best known for his coverage of the 1984 famine in Ethiopia, when he teamed up with the BBC's Michael Buerk to show the world the extent of that country's suffering, which lead to Live Aid and a huge global charity appeal.</p><p>Amin has been working with a handful of other journalists to raise the funds for Africa's first independent news channel. For years, a news channel has been beyond the reach of any media organisation in Africa. Now, however, satellite and coverage costs, through new technology and the internet, make A24 a dream within reach. An announcement that the venture is ready to start is expected shortly.</p><p>The channel will offer breaking news, analysis and a platform for sharing ideas between Africans from across the continent and beyond. It will use a range of distribution methods including streaming on the internet and mobile phones. Africa is enjoying an explosion of mobile usage and the channel bosses plan to encourage its audience to send user-generated content to its Nairobi headquarters.</p><p>Eventually, A24 will run 46 news bureaux across the continent. As well as reporting the big stories, they will focus on areas that all too often fail to make the news elsewhere. Subjects such as business and economic growth, politics and governance, and healthcare and culture. A24 will cover both the uplifting as well as the depressing news from Africa.</p><p>The channel will be editorially independent and plans to train its own journalists through the A24 Foundation with the help of Norway's Gimlekollen School of Journalism. The foundation will coordinate this training in cooperation with universities and institutes in South Africa, Ethiopia and Kenya as well as major TV news agencies.</p><p>A24 is in discussion with a wide range of international broadcasters and partners about content-sharing, distribution and support, and the channel's two founders, Amin and managing director Daniel Rivkin, plan to roll the channel out both online and on television during next year. \"A24 will make a difference because it will create a new kind of voice,\" says Amin. \"It will be truly African, beyond local politics and beyond prejudices.\" </p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>The writer is editorial advisory board chairman of A24 and a former managing director of CNN International</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/24/mondaymediasection.television1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/2007/sep/24/mondaymediasection.television1","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"Jenny Kleeman: Wikileaks - whistleblowing made easy","webPublicationDate":"2007-09-17T07:09:28Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/2007/sep/17/digitalmedia.humanrights","fields":{"body":"Got a secret you're burning to tell the world?

No one is quite sure who is behind it, but the site says Chinese dissidents had a hand in its creation; meanwhile, some bloggers claim that Wikileaks is actually a CIA conspiracy. The site has done its best to dispel these rumours, but they can't be entirely refuted while the developers remain anonymous.<P>And while Wikileaks may look like Wikipedia, it isn't.

It is important to keep the greenhouse gas emissions produced by organic air freight in perspective. The trade of fruit and vegetables from Africa to the UK accounts for only 0.1% of all the UK's emissions. Therefore, banning organic green beans from Kenya or mange tout from Zambia, say, is not going to make much difference to the UK's overall carbon footprint. However, there are many poor people in Africa who depend on that trade, so, for them, banning organic air freight means fewer children in schools, no investment in small businesses, less development of the economy and more poverty.</p><p>Of course, it is in the interest of the whole world to live in a greener way. No one denies that we should all be thinking about the effects on the planet of the emissions caused by aviation, but we shouldn't be looking to the poorest people in the world to save us from climate change. Every country is going to have to make some sacrifices for the environment and I think it is much fairer to ask everyone in the UK to give up one of their cars than it is to ask families in Africa to give up their entire year's income. It isn't acceptable for us to keep driving to the supermarket in our gas-guzzling 4 x 4s but stop people from developing countries from selling us their products because it has had to be flown into the UK. It shouldn't be the poor who suffer while we carry on in our own little world.</p><p>I don't think there is a single magic bullet to increase development in poorer countries but trade is undeniably a force for good - if it is the right sort of trade. In some countries exports are a very important part of the solution, and we can't deny that fact. At the moment, developing countries earn twice as much trading with UK supermarkets as the UK gives them in debt relief, so it is incredibly significant for their economies.</p><p>We all need to be thinking about ways to reduce poverty without damaging the environment. The organic movement should be a part of that, but rather than saying where the axe should fall now, we should be looking at how we can help organic farmers in Africa achieve this aim. A start would be giving them access to technology and investment so they can produce crops that have a longer shelf life and can be shipped to us, rather than air-freighted. We have to give them the tools to be able to reduce their environmental impact, rather than just cutting them out of the market.</p><p><strong>Yes</strong></p><p><strong>Jon Stewart, campaigner for pressure group Airport Watch</strong></p><p>There are major problems with the air-freighting of organic produce, which we need to address. The contribution of aviation to global warming is the most alarming. The figure that is often quoted is that it accounts for 2% of emissions worldwide. That figure seems quite low, but because it is a worldwide average and people in poor countries hardly fly, it essentially means the developed world's aviation emissions are proportionately very high.</p><p>Farmers in the developing world may have a sense of security from exporting fresh produce, but it is a false security because the poorest will feel the effects of climate change most immediately and most acutely. That's why richer countries need to take action first.</p><p>Another problem is the noise pollution caused by air freight and the impact it has on local communities in the UK. A lot of freight comes in on rather old, noisy planes, which often arrive at night. For example, East Midlands airport has more than 160 flights flying over rural Leicestershire every night and the people are being driven crazy by it. This may seem a small problem compared with what people in the developing world are facing, but don't forget they suffer from it too, only at the other end.</p><p>Also, air-freighting will soon become economically unsustainable as the demand for oil starts to outstrip supply. This will cause fuel prices, including the price of aviation kerosene, to rise rapidly. Farmers in Kenya who are growing organically are becoming almost entirely reliant on air freight to sell their goods. In the short term, that will bring some development benefits but it is a high-risk strategy. I would argue that it is unwise to become so dependent on a form of transport that won't be able to continue in the future the way it is now. Instead of being tied to this unsustainable form of trade, it would be more sensible to develop local trade, industry and agriculture.</p><p>It is a very difficult decision for ethical consumers to stop buying organic fresh produce that has been air-freighted to the UK because they naturally want to support farmers in the developing world. But they are also environmentally conscious. Therefore, I'm not advocating a ban on organic air freight overnight. But I do believe there has got to be a planned programme over the next 10 to 20 years where developing economies become less dependent on air freight and create more local opportunities. A selective ban with some exemptions introduced over a number of years seems the most equitable way forward.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>If you would like to comment on the Soil association's air freight consultation, visit <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/airfreight\">soilassociation.org/airfreight</a>.

We stand ready to assist Kenya with any asset recovery, as we have done successfully with Nigeria. But the Kenyans have not requested assistance despite our offer. Nor have they provided the information we would need to comply with any such request. Last year, when Lord Goldsmith [then attorney general] was in Kenya with Kenya's assistant minister of foreign affairs, Danson Mungatana, they confirmed publicly that we had offered this assistance.\"<P>British officials in Kenya have also been in contact with the government of Mwai Kibaki to \"clarify\" the accusation that Britain had refused to help. Britain has led donor countries in calling for the prosecution of corrupt politicians, and Sir Edward Clay, the previous high commissioner in Nairobi, famously accused the government of \"vomiting on the shoes\" of donor countries by failing to stem corruption.<P>Although the leaked report focuses on Daniel arap Moi's sons and two close allies, it also mentions several sitting MPs, including at least one current cabinet minister, as well as officials close to President Kibaki. Kroll is also understood to have investigated about 17 other people with ties to the former president, but these reports have yet to be made public.<P>It also emerged yesterday that in 2004, Kenyan anti-corruption officials were near to freezing an offshore account with $300m (about &pound;149m) of looted money in it but were thwarted when the cash was moved after a tip-off from within Kenya.<P>The document lists properties in Britain, including a luxury flat in Lowndes Square in Knightsbridge and houses in Surrey supposedly purchased by the Mois or their associates.<P>The Kenyan government has begun a damage limitation operation over the publication of the 110-page dossier on corruption compiled by the international risk consultant Kroll in 2004 but never published until the website Wikileaks released it this week.<P>\"There is enough information now to blow not just the Mois but most of the Kenyan establishment out of the water,\" Sir Edward said last night. \"The scale and type of the money-laundering is what we were given to understand existed during the time I was in Kenya.\"<P>As to who leaked the document, Sir Edward said: \"The motives for leaking this are probably complex but I suppose have something to do with reminding Mr Moi that his support for the president is quite important because here is the reminder that they have the dirt on him.\"<P><b>At a glance</b><P>Modelled on the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia in design and spirit, <a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks\">Wikileaks</a> - the website which obtained the Kroll report - was established to facilitate \"untraceable mass document leaking and analysis\".

Recently declassified secret documents reveal how at the end of the second world war an elite British unit abducted hundreds of German scientists and technicians and put them to work at government ministries and private firms in the UK.</p><p>The programme was designed to loot the defeated country's intellectual assets, impeding its ability to compete while giving a boost to British business.</p><p>In a related programme, German businessmen are alleged to have been forced to travel to post-war Britain to be questioned by their commercial rivals, and were interned if they refused to reveal trade secrets.</p><p>The economic warfare programmes are detailed in batches of Foreign Office files, marked \"Top Secret\", many of which lay unseen at the National Archives at Kew until discovered by the Guardian.</p><p>The files detail the way in which the scramble to uncover the Nazis' military secrets during the dying days of the conflict in Europe, to assist the continuing war effort in the Far East, turned rapidly to an early cold war campaign to prevent Germany's scientific and industrial assets falling into Soviet hands. This, in turn, offered the British government an opportunity to exploit the scientific and technical know-how of the defeated nation, with scientists being regarded as a form of human booty who could help give the UK an economic and commercial edge </p><p>While it has long been known that German scientists and technicians worked in the US and Britain after the war, it has generally been assumed they were all volunteers, lured by the promise of good pay and accommodation. However, the declassified papers make clear that for more than two years after the cessation of hostilities the British authorities were subjecting them to a programme of \"enforced evacuation\".</p><p>One memo found at Kew, written in August 1946 by a senior civil servant working with the British military government in northern Germany, makes clear how this programme worked. \"Usually an NCO arrives without notice at the house or office of the German and warns that he will be required. He does not give him any details of the reasons, nor does he present his credentials. Some time later the German is seized (often in the middle of the night) and removed under guard.</p><p>\"This procedure savours very much of the Gestapo methods and, quite apart from causing great and unnecessary inconvenience to the individual and to the industry employing him, it is bound to create feelings of alarm and insecurity.</p><p>\"I have not been able to get to the bottom of the matter, but there appear to be two bodies which carry out these kidnappings.\"</p><p>He was right. The records show that abductions in the British-controlled zone of post-war Germany were carried out on the orders of an organisation called the British Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee, or Bios. This committee was answerable to the cabinet and made up of representatives of the armed forces and Whitehall departments, including the Board of Trade and Ministry of Supply, as well as MI16 - the War Office's department of scientific intelligence.</p><p>The other organisation was the Field Information Agency (Technical), or Fiat, which had been established during the war as a joint Anglo-American military intelligence unit, and which earmarked scientists for \"enforced evacuation\" from the US and French zones, and Berlin. </p><p>The papers even record how 50 scientists were rounded up from their homes in Magdeburg in the Russian zone in June 1945, with many complaining over the loss of their homes, jobs and pensions.</p><p>Bios and Fiat both had offices in the same anonymous-looking Victorian town-house off Baker Street in London, from where investigators would be dispatched to search among the rubble of the shattered nation. While many factories were being dismantled, as part of a post-war plan to limit Germany's industrial capacity, the investigators would look for state-of-the-art machinery to be shipped back to Britain, research papers to be taken away and patents to be appropriated. These teams would often include representatives of firms such as ICI and Courtaulds, and others from the shipbuilding, steel or aerospace industries, usually wearing British army officers' uniforms. As well as deciding which equipment and documentation to take, they also identified scientists and technicians to be removed.</p><p>The legality was never questioned: the British military government's Proclamation No2 included a catch-all clause which said Germany would \"provide such transport, plant, equipment and materials of all kinds, labour, personnel, and specialist and other services, for use in Germany or elsewhere, as the allied representatives may direct\". Bios and Fiat also took advantage of post-war legal disagreements over what could be taken as reparations - which had been carefully negotiated by the allies - and what could be taken as \"booty\" - military material which the victors were entitled to seize from the battlefield. After six years of total war, the British took the view that anything of scientific or industrial importance had a military potential, and that the whole of Germany had become a battlefield.</p><p>Responsibility for seizing the scientists fell to a unique British army unit known as T-Force. Formed shortly after D Day, this lightly armed and highly-mobile force had raced ahead of allied troops at the end of the war, seizing objects which had a scientific or intelligence value before they could be sabotaged by retreating Germans, or captured by the Soviet Union.</p><p>After the war some officers and men from T-Force were formed into the Enemy Personnel Exploitation Section, which would escort the Bios and Fiat investigators and then take away the scientists and technicians wanted for interrogation.</p><p>Many of the detainees had indeed been involved in armaments work. The papers show that among those most sought after were men with expertise in underwater acoustics, infrared technology, electron microscopes, munitions, optical glass and aircraft engine design. Other target lists at Kew reveal a determination to trace technicians with knowledge of a \"method of causing temporary blindness by ultra violet rays\", the manufacture of Sarin gas, and \"physiological trials of chemical warfare gases\" - which had been conducted on concentration camp inmates.</p><p>Also among the Bios teams, however, were British industrialists eager to learn more about anything from the coal mining to comb making, and from latest German printing technology to the secrets of leading perfume manufacturers.</p><p>In November 1946 the New Statesman reported that three members of a six-strong Bios team, which included representatives of Pears Soap, Max Factor and Yardley, had called at the home of an elderly woman whose family firm manufactured 4711 eau-de-cologne, a famous brand, and attempted to bully her into handing over the recipe. When she was taken ill the team threatened to call a prison van to take her to a prison hospital. Next day they telephoned to try again.</p><p>As a young civil servant, Julia Draper was the only civilian and the only woman attached to T-Force, where she would help to track down German scientists. Now aged 86, she recalls at her home in London that Bios investigators were as much concerned with capturing the intellectual property of British industry's German rivals as they were with learning more about the Nazis' military secrets.</p><p>\"Many of the requests came from the War Office, but there were also requests from businesses like ICI and the other major industrial firms,\" she says. \"Some of these scientists were remarkably important people in their field, and there was a lot we could learn from them.\"</p><p>She recalls scientists being detained and sent to Britain against their will. \"There were things of that nature. T-Force was a very, very strange organisation to be in.\"</p><p>Some of the Germans would undoubtedly have volunteered to help, but others were clearly compelled. The files show some were imprisoned in an Anglo-American internment camp near Frankfurt, while many were taken to internment camps in Britain. After interrogation, which could last months, they were either returned to Germany or put to work with government ministries or British firms.</p><p>It is unclear exactly how many men fell prey to this programme. In July 1946 military government officials told the Foreign Office they estimated there were 1,500 scientists who should forcibly be evacuated, 500 of them in the British zone. \"The proposed long-term policy is ... to remove as soon as possible from Germany, whether they are willing to go or not.\" Minutes of a Bios meeting three months later quote one official as saying the organisation could not deal with more than 600. The civil servant who complained of the \"kidnappings\" and \"Gestapo methods\" wrote that he knew of seven scientists from one IG Farben chemical plant who had been abducted in the previous two months.</p><p>Those who were put to work in Britain were paid, with Bios agreeing that each scientist would receive 15 shillings a week to cover expenses. Initially, however, no provision was made for wives and children left behind.</p><p>In May 1946 the British military government urged Bios to make payments to dependants, as \"cases of extreme hardship have previously occurred through Germans being removed to the UK for interrogation\". Fiat was also concerned about this, but wanted the government to provide the funds. \"Several familes ... are completely destitute,\" Fiat warned, adding that \"this is likely to have very unfavourable effect on cooperation of other German scientists and technicians\".</p><p>By October of that year some US army officers were refusing to allow T-Force to remove scientists from the American zone unless they provided payments in advance. The following month came the British response: each wife and child would be provided with \"heavy workers' rations\", and each family would receive 250kg of coal a month.</p><p>Scientists were not the sole targets. The papers disclose brief details about Operation Bottleneck, which aimed to extract business information. In January 1947 Erich Klabunde, head of the German journalists' union, complained about how this was being achieved. A British official in Hamburg reported to headquarters that Klabunde told a public meeting: \"An English manufacturer would name his German counterpart and competitor and 'invite' him to England (whether the man comes voluntarily or not is questionable). They then discuss business and the German is gently persuaded to reveal secrets of his trade. When he refuses, he is kept in polite internment until he gets so tired of not being allowed to return to his family that he tells the Englishman what he wants to know. Thus for about &pound;6 a day the English businessman gains the deepest secrets of Germany's economic life.\"</p><p>The rationale for this had been set out by Herbert Morrison, lord president of the council, who told the prime minister, Clement Attlee: \"It is most important at this formative stage to start shaping the German economy in the way which will best assist our own economic plans and will run the least risk of it developing into an unnecessarily awkward competitor.\"</p><p>The British were not alone in trying to secure commercial advantage from Germany's scientists: countless numbers had also been snatched by the Russians. The French used a different approach, luring skilled workers with lucrative contracts, and the Americans offered US citizenship to those they wanted most, including Wernher von Braun, who had headed the V2 rocket programme and went on to be chief architect of the Saturn V rocket which propelled the US to the moon.</p><p>While the Foreign Office warned against bringing scientists with \"politically undesirable\" backgrounds to the UK, the papers show little evidence of industry being concerned about the employment of Nazis.</p><p>By early 1947 the Foreign Office, exasperated at the way in which the looting of German industry, by all four occupying powers, was impeding the country's reconstruction, secured an agreement that it would cease. Accordingly, the British were expected to stop abducting scientists, and the military government sent a telegram to T-Force ordering that all \"industrial and technical investigations will be terminated by 30 June 1947\".</p><p>There was no intention of allowing these scientists to do as they pleased, however, as some may have chosen to work for the Soviets. In April the Ministry of Defence drew up a list of 290 scientists to be traced urgently. This formed the basis of a so-called denial list \"against whom denial measures should be taken as a matter of urgency\".</p><p>Allowing German arms experts to settle elsewhere in Europe would be equally inadvisable, a Foreign Office discussion paper noted. \"It has hitherto been an objective of British policy to encourage the smaller powers, particularly in Europe, to equip their forces with aircraft and weapons of British design. If these countries were to obtain technical reinforcement by recruitment of German research workers and designers they would be less likely ... to rely upon armaments of British design.\"</p><p>From now on, however, German scientists were to be given employment contracts - which included a clause forbidding them ever to talk about their experiences - and strongly encouraged, rather than coerced, into travelling to Britain. By the end of the summer, hundreds were employed across Britain.</p><p>While many British industries, particularly aerospace and armaments, wished to employ them, others were not sufficiently well organised to do so and there were too many scientists and too few jobs. The government sent a few to Canada and Australia, and then appears to have concluded that they should go anywhere - except Russia or Europe. It must have been in some desperation that Ernest Bevin, the foreign secretary, suggested to the cabinet defence committee: \"Would it not, for example, be possible to carry out some fundamental research in Kenya?\"</p><p><strong>Beneficiaries</strong></p><p>British industrialists were eager to learn as much as they could from Germany, from the mining of coal to the making of perfume. According to the National Archives, companies that employed German scientists and technicians immediately after the second world war included:</p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> ICI, the chemicals giant</p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> Courtaulds, the manufacturer of fabric, clothing, and artificial fibres</p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> Pears, the soap and cosmetics company</p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> Yardley, the maker of fragrances and toiletries</p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> Coal Oil Development, a company based in Swansea</p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> BSA Tools, the Birmingham machine toolmaker</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/aug/29/sciencenews.secondworldwar","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/science/2007/aug/29/sciencenews.secondworldwar","sectionName":"Science"},{"webTitle":"Time out","webPublicationDate":"2007-08-18T22:56:37Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2007/aug/18/gapyears.students","fields":{"body":"<p>For anyone taking a year off between school and university, the next 12 months offer untold possibilities. Whether you've planned a gap year or have just had one thrust upon you by your exam results, suddenly finding that the world is your oyster can be daunting: there are no rules and anything's possible.</p><p>Everyone has to deal with constraints - that's just a life thing. Lack of money, exam resits, caring responsibilities for relatives or understandable anxiety about launching yourself out of the family home are just some examples. But it's the ingenuity with which you deal with those constraints that will make or break your gap year. Here are seven examples of different ways to spend what could be best time of your life ...</p><p><strong>Paid gap to confirm choice of career</strong></p><p>If you've got a good idea of your future career but no practical experience on which to base your aspirations, why not try to get a paid job in the relevant sector, even working in a lowly capacity, to see if the reality matches up to the dream?</p><p><strong>Tom Wade<br />Age </strong>20<br /><strong>Gap</strong> Agency work supporting vulnerable young people.<br /><strong>Now</strong> Studying youth and community work with applied theology at Oxford Brookes<br /></p><p>I knew that I wanted to become a youth worker, but felt it was vital to gain some experience in that field before investing the time in getting the qualifications. So I planned my gap year specifically as a time to test out the waters, and joined the paid intern programme of the Luton Churches Education Trust, which works with young people at risk.</p><p>Right from the offset, some of the stuff I was faced with was eye-opening. I had led a pretty sheltered life prior to this, and suddenly found myself supporting young people who self-harmed and didn't want their parents to know, young people who were unwanted by their families, who didn't know how to control their anger but wanted to change, and young people who just didn't care about the future because they had nothing to look forward to. It was tough and rewarding at the same time: if someone was rude or confrontational, it was easy to feel down or that I wasn't up to helping them. I think the main thing is to keep persevering in those situations.</p><p>I found the whole year incredibly challenging, but in a good way. It was hard starting somewhere new at first and not knowing anyone. Also, to begin with I was hearing from school friends about the brilliant time they were having at university, which sometimes made me feel like I was missing out. But I was soon completely engrossed in the work.</p><p>There were lots of highlights; one was the summer camp we ran, where 40 or so young people put on a play for their family and carers to come and watch. We encouraged them to get involved in acting, directing, sound, lighting, dance, stage design, art and costume. It was a massive effort but really worthwhile to see how proud they were after their performance.</p><p>Any doubts that I'd previously felt about getting involved in youth work were removed in those amazing 12 months. I grew up a lot, saw things that required maturity and knowledge to deal with sensitively, and these are skills I can now apply to all aspects of my life.</p><p><strong>A job just for the money</strong></p><p>If you need to get a job in your gap year, and local employment options are limited to McDonalds, then you might have to set yourself a goal to make the daily grind more bearable: save up and plan a trip away at the end, or stage some cheaper treats along the way. It sounds prissy, but learning to do even a dead-end job well requires commitment and application, and if you deal with a mindnumbingly boring situation with flair - by starting a regular poker game or book club in your lunch hour, say, to give you some mental stimulation - it'll make future employers sit up and take note of your resourcefulness.</p><p><strong>Murray Goulden<br />Age</strong> 26<br /><strong>Then</strong> Call-centre worker<br /><strong>Now</strong>Third-year PhD student at Nottingham University</p><p>I didn't get the three Bs I needed to go to Nottingham University, which I'd set my heart on, so I decided to retake English and was then faced with a gap year I hadn't planned.</p><p>Even living at home I knew I'd have to find some kind of work while I revised for the resit. Where I grew up, in rural mid-Wales, there wasn't much work to be had, though, and certainly nothing stimulating. I ended up working at Kay's Catalogues, inputting orders into their computer system: it was incredibly monotonous and frustrating, if reasonably well paid at about &#163;7 an hour. After a couple of months I was promoted to the call-centre inquiry line, which was basically dealing with complaints all day.</p><p>There was little that was rewarding about the experience apart from the occasional satisfaction of sorting out somebody's problem. If nothing else, it made me determined that this would be the last time I'd ever do that kind of work. Mind you, it gave me the topic for my undergraduate dissertation, which I wrote on the experience of workers in call-centre environments! Anyway, I went part-time in the end to give me time to study for my A-level, which helped to mitigate the boredom, and thankfully I passed with the B I needed.</p><p>Halfway through the job, in the real dog days of winter, I decided to save up enough to go to New York for a week at the end of the year, and that was the goal that really got me through the tedium. For anyone who misses out on an A-level grade like I did, if you really want to go to a particular university, it's definitely worth the effort of resitting and doing whatever it takes to get there.</p><p><strong>Multi-placement gap to test out career options</strong></p><p>It's always worth writing to request an unpaid work placement in an area you're passionate about, even if it's just shadowing someone for a couple of days. Employers are impressed by enthusiasm, and if you don't ask, you don't get. Use any contacts you can muster: relatives, friends, parents' colleagues, and if money's not an issue, don't worry about staying local. Do as much research on the organisation you're applying to as you can, turn up on time every single day and ask lots of questions. One placement can lead to another, or even to paid work if you're lucky.</p><p><strong>Annie Brown<br />Age</strong> 28<br /><strong>Gap</strong> Short-term environmental placements<br /><strong>Now </strong>Project engineer, Halcrow</p><p>For as long as I can remember, I've wanted a career in which the work I do has a positive impact on the environment. During my gap year, I knew I wanted to try out as many ways of working in the environmental sector as time allowed, so I temped in offices to earn enough money to take up volunteering opportunities when I heard about them. Temping also gave me the flexibility to go for it when I got the chance to try out something interesting at short notice.</p><p>My first placement was at the <a href=\"http://www.cat.org.uk\">Centre for Alternative Technology</a> in mid-Wales, which because it's at the dark green end of the spectrum, testing out cutting-edge technologies, really opened my eyes to just how far sustainable living can go.</p><p>I then did hands-on conservation work and volunteer weeks with the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk\">National Trust</a> and <a href=\"http://www2.btcv.org.uk\">British Trust for Conservation Volunteers</a> (BTCV). This was loads of fun and I met people with similar interests - not just my peers, but older, more experienced people who had explored varied careers and lifestyles.</p><p>I also spent couple of weeks at <a href=\"http://www.wastewatch.org.uk\">Wastewatch</a>, a charity that goes into schools and organisations to demonstrate the impact of waste and what can be done to reduce it.</p><p>The last part of my gap year, which might not sound particularly environmental, but really galvanised my belief in the urgent importance of sustainability, was four months teaching in Malawi. That experience highlighted the enormous gap in consumption between the UK and African countries and drummed it home that if everyone in the world lived like a UK citizen then the planet could not possibly sustain us all.</p><p>All those experiences had a big influence on how I chose my specialist subjects during my BEng mechanical engineering degree and subsequent MSc in environmental sustainability, as well as firing the passion I now have for designing engineering solutions to create rigorously energy-efficient buildings.</p><p>Getting to where I am now, as an engineer, was a dream without much of a shape before my gap year, but the different volunteering experiences I tried out at various stages throughout that 12 months helped me to focus in much more tightly on how I wanted to develop my skills to contribute to a more sustainable future.</p><p><strong>Volunteering in the UK</strong></p><p>There are ways of opening your eyes to new experiences without having to pay for the privilege: some charities will offer you travel expenses to and from your placement; Community Service Volunteers even offers living expenses to enable you to volunteer away from home.</p><p><strong>Naomi Somerville-Large<br />Age</strong> 19<br /><strong>Gap</strong> Full-time volunteer with Community Service Volunteers<br /><strong>Now</strong> Going to Edinburgh in October to study history and politics I wanted to get some experience of living independently before going to uni, and because I've spent most of my life in Kenya, I also wanted to acclimatise myself to living in the UK.</p><p>Once I started researching volunteering opportunities, I saw that CSV offered one kind of placement where you supported a disabled student to attend their lectures at university. I quite fancied that, but ended up being offered something completely different: working with young adults with learning disabilities. To be honest, I hadn't had any exposure to anyone with a learning disability up to that point and didn't know a lot about it, so on the day I arrived I felt completely overwhelmed.</p><p>Initially, you shadow another volunteer and gradually you get given more responsibility. The day centre where I volunteer runs sessions to equip the service users to do work placements in the community. When they're not busy doing that, they come in to learn life skills. That can be paying bills or crossing the road safely, very simple things that most of us don't have to think twice about.</p><p>Day to day, I get in at 9 o'clock, open the centre, make it comfortable for everyone when they turn up, put the kettle on and choose some music. Then, together with other CSV volunteers, I help to deliver the learning sessions. We had a couple of days' training and I've learned masses more while I've been on the job.</p><p>There are times I've had to assert myself very strongly, when a service user is having a bad day, for example. Or maybe someone might get really annoyed with you, or you're taking a session and there's no one around to support you and it's a particularly difficult group. I've become a lot more confident and it's nice to know that I can relate to people with learning disabilities in challenging situations without feeling scared.</p><p>The best bits are just small moments, like when a client is cheeky and makes you smile, or when somebody learns how to do something with you and still remembers it a week later. It's a slow process; the service users are trying very hard to learn such basic stuff and there's no instant reward, but I must enjoy it - I extended my placement from four months to six.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.csv.org.uk\">CSV</a> offers full-time UK-based volunteer placements lasting four to 12 months. Other volunteering opportunities can be researched at <a href=\"http://www.volunteering.org.uk\">www.volunteering.org.uk</a></p><p><strong>Gap-year reveller</strong></p><p>If you want to bum around for your gap year (er, sorry, explore the wonders of our extraordinary planet) and managed to get a handout from the Bank of Mum and Dad, then you're sitting pretty. If your parental credit line has dried up and you still want to party your way around the world, you'll have to work for it. There are ways of earning a crust while circumnavigating the globe, and they don't all involve a daily 9-5. Check out the new edition of Work Your Way Around the World by Susan Griffith to find out how to get paid to count bats in New Zealand, get crewing work on a yacht in the West Indies or land a job as a croupier on a cruise ship.</p><p><strong>Anna Jane Sharp<br />Age</strong> 23<br /><strong>Gap</strong> Skiing in France, camping in Italy<br /><strong>Now</strong> Account manager, Drink PR; studied English literature and psychology at Newcastle University Nothing about my gap year was planned - I did everything by the seat of my pants and loved it. Right after I finished my exams in May, I got a job in Pizza Express to get some money together to go travelling. Anywhere that wasn't here was fine by me. After a few months' deliberating, I decided to do a ski season in Meribel, in France. It was an absolute blast. I and the friends I made there lived a completely hedonistic lifestyle, skiing all day, drinking into the small hours and skiing again once we'd managed to drag ourselves out of bed. I don't think I saw a newspaper in the six months I was there. A newsflash on one of the resort bar TVs informed me that Britain was at war. I felt totally removed from the rest of the world.</p><p>Towards the end of the ski season everyone starts planning their onward journeys - some to work in St Tropez or at the Cannes film festival, most touring around Australasia. But my friend Joe and I decided we wanted to go somewhere really hot, so with very little prior thought or organisation, we booked a couple of cheap Ryanair flights to Pisa, put some clothes in a backpack and set off. It was only when we touched down that Joe declared that doing the whole trip on Vespas would be fun. So we hired a couple - mine black, his electric blue - and vroom-vroomed all the way down to the most southerly tip of Sicily.</p><p>We would stop at hostels or campsites, sticking as close to the coast as possible, pitch our tent and wait in anticipation for the next Italian family to arrive. Soon camper vans containing mum, dad, two sons, three daughters, two uncles, two aunts, three cousins, grandma and grandpa would pitch up. Three tables and 15 chairs would be unpacked, plus a full gas stove and huge metal pots, electric lights, gazebos and often a television, too. One extremely kind family included us in their massive family suppers and then woke us at 6am every morning with freshly brewed knock-your-socks-off espressos.</p><p>The whole time felt incredibly carefree and that was exactly what I wanted. Travelling under my own steam helped me to grow up and become more self-reliant, as well as teaching me a lot about who I could and couldn't trust - I wasn't nearly as naive when I got home as I was when I set out. Enjoying my gap year this way hasn't held me back at all. My CV is packed with extra-curricular activities and volunteering experience. I think it's really important to be able to completely switch off and let yourself off the leash now and then, and I'd love the chance to do it again sometime - when I've saved up enough money.</p><p><strong>Long-term volunteering abroad</strong></p><p>If you want to volunteer abroad, then you'll need to go with an organisation that works specifically with young people: many want only qualified, experienced volunteers. Check carefully the credentials of any organisation offering to place young, unqualified volunteers abroad, particularly since villages in developing countries, where many end up working, can be extremely isolated. Well-established outfits such as Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), Bunac, Students Partnership Worldwide (SPW), i-to-i and Global Vision International (GVI) have tried-and-tested recruitment, training and support systems in place, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go with smaller organisations; you just need to be more questioning of their back-up systems in the eventuality that anything goes wrong. It's always a good idea to ask to speak to previous volunteers, too, to find out how they enjoyed their placements.</p><p><strong>Emma Jones<br />Age</strong> 20<br /><strong>Gap</strong> Six months' volunteering in Chad to support street prostitutes<br /><strong>Now</strong> Studying English literature and philosophy at Durham University</p><p>Up until my gap year I was a sheltered, middle-class, grammar-school girl from Surrey. But I was hungry to travel outside my safe home environment, not only to explore new cultures and meet new people but to launch myself well and truly out of my comfort zone. Having visited India, which is where my family is from, I also had a deep desire to help poorer people in a tangible way. So after talking to some people in my church and doing my own research, I ended up going to Chad with a voluntary organisation called Mission Africa, which I would highly recommend.</p><p>The volunteer project to support women working as prostitutes in the capital, N'djamena, was just setting up as I arrived. By going out on to the streets each day with the German woman who was running the project, we began to form friendships with the women. By inviting them for tea, chatting, getting to know them in a gentle, gradual way and gaining their trust, they began, bit by bit, to tell us about their horrific situations. I'd never heard anything like it. To them, prostitution is a way of life that they've been made to think is all they deserve: violence, alcoholism and emotional abuse are seen as simply part of that job. I met a girl of 14 who had to sleep with the lorry drivers delivering beer to local bars to earn money for her father, who refused to work. Her mother, she told me, was too old by now to attract clients, so it fell to her.</p><p>I learned that these girls, despite the situations they are trapped in, are just normal young women. They didn't always want the shelter, medical help or counselling our project could offer - although some did, and wonderfully, three of them are now working as secretaries in a different country, having escaped the brothels. Some just wanted to have a laugh and paint their nails and be seen as people, not just commodities, and perhaps in the relationships we built up, we could offer them that, at least.</p><p>In my fourth month in Chad, civil war broke out. I remember waking up to the sound of fireworks, which in fact was the start of a rebel attack on the city. After three days locked in my mud house, I made the decision not to fly home, but to flee across the border to Cameroon. As I left, I couldn't help but feel torn apart wondering if the girls would be there, and OK, if and when I got back.</p><p>I saw people in some very desperate situations, but what I came home with wasn't the suffering, but the smiles of kids playing with a stick in the street or the sound of all the girls singing together at a camp we put on, which was the first time that many had spent more than a day off drugs in years.</p><p>It was a time that helped me to realise that being very poor doesn't mean you can't be compassionate to others, as well of heaps of fun to be with. I certainly see the world as bigger than just getting a degree and a career now, and I've learned that giving time to people, in whatever capacity you can, is the most valuable thing you can offer them, whether they're rich, poor, your best mate hanging out in Starbucks or a starving child with malaria in the Sahara.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.missionafrica.org.uk\">Mission Africa</a> works in Chad, Burkina Faso and Nigeria</p><p><strong>Short-term volunteering abroad</strong></p><p>If you're dead-set on volunteering abroad but need to spend of most of your year preparing for retakes, it might be worth working like an eejit while scrimping and saving for the chance to blow it all on a few glorious weeks away once you've laid down your pen and handed in your last paper.</p><p><strong>Caroline Gosney<br />Age</strong> 20<br /><strong>Gap</strong> Six-week expedition to Madagascar with Blue Ventures<br /><strong>Now</strong> Studying history at Exeter University Last year, on results day, I was devastated. I hadn't done enough work and missed my grades for my first-choice university. I spent most of that day in tears, and it took a while for the shock to subside and to decide what to do. Rather than take my insurance choice, I chose to take a year out and retake the modules to get my grades.</p><p>As it happened, just before results day I'd begun working at a restaurant. When I told them about my gap year they kept me on and I worked there full-time for five months to be able to afford to do something extraordinary. All my friends were either heading off to uni or had planned their gap years months in advance, so there were times when I felt pretty alone as I slogged it out, but I had no idea then just how worth it the trip I eventually took would prove to be.</p><p>When you go on the web it seems like the possibilities for gap-year travel are endless. But I'd always wanted to go to Africa, and while I was browsing, an organisation called <a href=\"http://www.blueventures.org\">Blue Ventures</a> popped up. Based in Madagascar, in a tiny village called Andavadoaka, their scientific team takes on volunteers who contribute to their environmental research, gathering data on endangered coral reef, with the aim of making the surrounding ocean a Marine Protected Area. I'd never been diving before, so the opportunity to learn in such a beautiful area while contributing to a conservation project really sold it to me.</p><p>The whole experience of Madagascar was such an adventure for me. From spending 27 hours on a boutre (just like a pirate ship, but with no shade) on our way to the research site, to sleeping under the stars; from learning how to dive and becoming a fully qualified rescue diver to memorising numerous coral species as part of the data-gathering for the research; from teaching English to village children and learning to get on with people from totally different backgrounds and countries ... it's something I'll never forget. I have never felt as happy as when I was living in a leaky hut infested with cockroaches and getting up at 5.30am to head out into the Indian Ocean and dive with species of flora and fauna seen nowhere else in the world.</p><p>We dived six days out of seven to gather data in different areas, and before my group left, Blue Ventures did a breakdown of all the information we had collected, which demonstrates in a very concrete way your contribution and how much their conservation project relies on volunteers. If I'd fulfilled my offer requirements last August I'd never have met all those fantastic people, or seen a flock of flamingos rising from the mangrove swamps, or swum with a giant grouper - or grown up so much. Having to work for the money to go on such an adventure was valuable, too; I learned much more by earning it myself, and because it was my money rather than a hand-out from my parents, I felt I could decide completely independently what I wanted to do and how to spend it.</p><p>Other short-term paid volunteering opportunities abroad:<br /><a href=\"http://www.habitatforhumanity.org.uk\">www.habitatforhumanity.org.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tearfund.org/transform\">www.tearfund.org/transform</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/aug/18/gapyears.students","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2007/aug/18/gapyears.students","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Development studies: listening to locals is key","webPublicationDate":"2007-08-01T08:00:00Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2007/aug/01/academicexperts-international-aid-and-development","fields":{"body":"<p>I became very interested in environmental issues and in how people in other cultures live from a long way back, from research that I did while I was a student in Cambridge, and I spent some summer holidays in Tanzania and Sri Lanka. I just became fascinated by the village level field work that I've really gone on doing ever since.</p><p>I went on to do a PhD which took me to the rain forest in Sierra Leone. Then work in Guinea with my husband in the early 1990s led to me publishing a book ('Misreading the African Landscape'). We went to an area which had been assumed to be undergoing a huge deforestation crisis, and there were many aid agencies and programs putting millions of dollars in to try and deal with this environmental degradation.</p><p>We found that, in fact, the landscape in the past had been grassland and the forests were there because of people and not despite them. That was a set of findings that turned a lot of aid policy issues around and enabled us to write the book, which then became a film. It was important to my career but, more to the point, it was quite important to the field of anthropology and ecology and to policy debates around environment and development.</p><p>I absolutely believe that development projects should listen to and work with locals rather than try to impose a one-size-fits-all approach. It's what I've argued over the years, firstly in relation to environmental issues, forests and policies around bio-diversity and more recently in relation to health issues.</p><p>I myself have been working on vaccinations where, very much, parents want far more tailored approaches to scheduling, to programs, and approaches to education about vaccines that actually build on their own knowledge and understanding. There have been many cases where 'top-down' programs that didn't listen to the locals have met with tremendous resistance because they simply haven't fitted the issues as people understood them, they haven't met their needs or they haven't spoken in a way that speaks to people's real concerns.</p><p>There's an increasing tendency, particularly now, to feel that there are technical fixes for development problems, that we can bring people out of poverty or we can solve hunger in Africa, or we can solve problems of ill health simply by magic bullets of the right drug, the right vaccine, the right improved feed. But of course it's far more complicated than that and what one's got going on are social and political causes of poverty, often relating to conflict, or people simply not having access to land or to resources they need. If one fails to take those things into account, then technical fixes simply aren't going to work.</p><p>I've just become director of the Steps (social, technological and environmental pathways to sustainability) centre. It's a new centre that links the group I work with at the Institute of Development Studies with researchers at the Science Policy Research Unit, also on the University of Sussex campus, but it also works with a network of partners around the world; with people in Asia, Africa and Latin America. In a way, it's something that's been building for a long time. The work I've been doing with colleages at IDS has been arguing for an approach that takes complexity and dynamics seriously, that listens to local voices, that engages citizens in finding their own solutions. We've been collaborating with others in doing that, but with this new centre we've finally got the funding umbrella to enable us to do some really serious work in this area.</p><p>We're very ambitious. We're working across issues around food, issues around health and issues around water, and we've got a very ambitious set of projects planned, but also a good group of people and a good network of partners. We are very much engaging with policymakers from the very beginning. We've been having discussions with the chief scientist at the Department for International Development just the other day, we've been in discussion with some of the big funders, we're engaging in workshops and conferences with, for example, the people running the Millennium Project and the new Green Revolution for Africa; as well as policymakers in the food and water and food fields.</p><p>The idea is to try and encourage debates which look beyond these one-size-fits-all solutions and try and encourage policymakers to think much harder about both local voices and also about why they take the views that they do, and to realise that those might not be the only ways of looking at a problem. It's encouraging what in social science terms would be called reflexivity, but it really just means being a bit more aware of your position and how your own views may not be the only views out there. So although a lot of our work with policymakers will be in relation to our specific projects, we're also trying to encourage this broader debate right now</p><p>Sustainability is a holy grail, but it needs to be sustainability that is defined in terms that respond to people's real needs and in the ways we're using the term sustainability, that means meeting goals around poverty and around reducing social injustice as well as simply thinking about environmental sustainability. So for instance, it's no good to go about conserving forests if, at the same time, you are pushing people off their land and reducing their own livelihood opportunities.</p><p>Or if one wants to think about sustainability in food production, you've got to think about how poor farmers are doing and whether the system is actually meeting their own livelihood needs as well as whether it's sustainable in some general sense.</p><p>We're currently in the midst of planning a first set of five projects which will all be field work-based. They include a project on peri-urban dynamics in Indian cities, what's happening to people in some of the poorest areas as cities expand and people are facing huge problems of overcrowding and pressure on services and water and pollution (if they're farming). That's work that will be going on in Delhi during next year. </p><p>We've also got a project in Kenya with the African Centre for Technology Studies, which is looking at farming systems for maize and how they can be made more sustainable and the innovations that are going to help in that way. We've got a project on regulating drugs and seeds, which is involving field work in China and India. And we've got a project on epidemics involving case studies around the world: we've got some work in South Africa and Indonesia, India and West Africa. </p><p>In some respects we have the luxury with the Steps centre funding of a slightly longer timeframe. The centre has initial funding of five years and then assuming we pass our mid-term review there might be another five years' funding. And that's very important because that long time perspective is really crucial for building the real partnerships with researchers and policymakers in developing countries and seeing one's findings through to some real influence and making a difference. Having said that, we're also under pressure to produce some results and this first set of projects will have a two-year timeframe and we'll hope to have some outputs, practical insights for policy and some methods and tools and manuals and so on, as well as more academic output within a two-year period. And that will give us the basis for then planning another round of projects within the first five years of the centre's life.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/aug/01/academicexperts-international-aid-and-development","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2007/aug/01/academicexperts-international-aid-and-development","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Jeremy Scahill questions the wisdom of the 48,000 US -backed mercenaries in Iraq","webPublicationDate":"2007-08-01T01:24:12Z","sectionId":"uk-news","id":"uk/2007/aug/01/military.usa","fields":{"body":"It was described as a \"powder keg\" moment. In late May, just across the Tigris river from Baghdad's fortified Green Zone, a heavily armed convoy of American forces was driving down a street near the Iraqi Interior Ministry. They were transporting US officials in what is known widely among the occupation forces as the \"red zone\" - essentially, any area of Iraq that does not fall inside the US-built \"emerald city\" in the capital. The American guards were on the look-out for any threat lurking on the roads. Not far from their convoy, an Iraqi driver was pulling out of a petrol station. When the Americans encountered the Iraqi driver, they determined him to be a potential suicide car bomber. In Iraq it has become common for such convoys to fire off rounds from a machine gun at approaching Iraqi vehicles, much to the outrage of Iraqi civilians and officials. The Americans say this particular Iraqi vehicle was getting too close to their convoy and that they tried to warn it to back off. They say they fired a warning shot at the car's radiator before firing directly into the windshield of the car, killing the driver. Some Iraqi witnesses said the shooting was unprovoked.<P>In the ensuing chaos, the Americans reportedly refused to give their names or details of the incident to Iraqi officials, sparking a tense standoff between the Americans and Iraqi forces, both of which were armed with assault rifles. It could have become even more bloody before a US military convoy arrived on the scene.<P>A senior US adviser to the Iraqi Interior Ministry's intelligence division told the Washington Post that the incident threatened to \"undermine a lot of the cordial relationships that have been built up over the past four years. There's a lot of angry people up here right now.\"<P>While there is ongoing outrage between Iraqis and the military over such deadly incidents, this one came with a different, but increasingly common, twist: The Americans involved in the shooting were neither US military nor civilians. They were operatives working for a secretive mercenary firm based in the wilderness of North Carolina. Its name is Blackwater USA.<P>It was hardly the company's first taste of action in Iraq, where it has operated almost since the first days of the occupation. Its convoys have been ambushed, its helicopters brought down, its men burned and dragged through the streets of Falluja, giving the Bush administration a justification for laying siege to the city. In all, the company has lost about 30 men in Iraq. It has also engaged in firefights with the Shia Mahdi Army, and succeeded by all means necessary in keeping alive every US ambassador to serve in post-invasion Iraq, along with more than 90 visiting US congressional delegations.<P>Just one day before the May shooting, in almost the exact same neighbourhood, Blackwater operatives found themselves in another gun battle, lasting an hour, that drew in both US military and Iraqi forces, in which at least four Iraqis are said to have died. The shoot-out was reportedly spurred by a well-coordinated ambush of Blackwater's convoy. US sources said the guards \"did their job\", keeping the officials alive.<P>In another incident that has caused major tensions between Baghdad and Washington, an off-duty Blackwater operative is alleged to have shot and killed an Iraqi bodyguard of the Shia vice-president Adil Abdul-Mahdi last Christmas Eve inside the Green Zone. Blackwater officials confirm that after the incident they whisked the contractor safely out of Iraq, which they say Washington ordered them to do. Iraqi officials labelled the killing a \"murder\". The company says it fired the contractor but he has yet to be publicly charged with any crime.<P>Iraqi officials have consistently complained about the conduct of Blackwater and other contractors - and the legal barriers to their attempts to investigate or prosecute alleged wrongdoing. Four years into the occupation, there is absolutely no effective system of oversight or accountability governing contractors and their operations. They have not been subjected to military justice, and only two cases have ever reached US civilian courts, under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which covers some contractors working abroad. (One man was charged with stabbing a fellow contractor, in a case that has yet to go to trial, while the other was sentenced to three years for possession of child-pornography images on his computer at Abu Ghraib prison.) No matter what their acts in Iraq, contractors cannot be prosecuted in Iraqi courts, thanks to US-imposed edicts dating back to Paul Bremer's post-invasion Coalition Provisional Authority.<P>The internet is alive with videos of contractors seemingly using Iraqi vehicles for target practice, much to the embarrassment of the firms involved. Yet, despite these incidents, and although 64 US soldiers have been court-martialled on murder-related charges, not a single armed contractor has been prosecuted for any crime, let alone a crime against an Iraqi. US contractors in Iraq reportedly have a motto: \"What happens here today, stays here today.\"<P>At home in America, Blackwater is facing at least two wrongful-death lawsuits, one stemming from the mob killings of four of its men in Falluja in March 2004, the other for a Blackwater plane crash in Afghanistan in November 2004, in which a number of US soldiers were killed. In both cases, families of the deceased charge that Blackwater's negligence led to the deaths. (Blackwater has argued that it cannot be sued and should enjoy the same immunity as the US military.) The company is also facing a mounting Congressional investigation into its activities. Despite all of this, US State Department officials heap nothing but words of praise on Blackwater for doing the job and doing it well.<P>There are now 630 companies working in Iraq on contract for the US government, with personnel from more than 100 countries offering services ranging from cooking and driving to the protection of high-ranking army officers. Their 180,000 employees now outnumber America's 160,000 official troops. The precise number of mercenaries is unclear, but last year, a US government report identified 48,000 employees of private military/security firms.<P>Blackwater is far from being the biggest mercenary firm operating in Iraq, nor is it the most profitable. But it has the closest proximity to the throne in Washington and to radical rightwing causes, leading some critics to label it a \"Republican guard\". Blackwater offers the services of some of the most elite forces in the world and is tasked with some of the occupation's most \"mission-critical\" activities, namely keeping alive the most hated men in Baghdad - a fact it has deftly used as a marketing tool. Since the Iraq invasion began four years ago, Blackwater has emerged out of its compound near the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina as the trendsetter of the mercenary industry, leading the way toward a legitimisation of one of the world's dirtiest professions. And it owes its meteoric rise to the policies of the Bush administration.<P>Since the launch of the \"war on terror\", the administration has funnelled billions of dollars in public funds to US war corporations such as Blackwater USA, DynCorp and Triple Canopy. These companies have used the money to build up private armies that rival or outgun many of the world's national militaries.<P>A decade ago, Blackwater barely existed; and yet its \"diplomatic security\" contracts since mid-2004, with the State Department alone, total more than $750m (&pound;370m). It protects the US ambassador and other senior officials in Iraq as well as visiting Congressional delegations; it trains Afghan security forces, and was deployed in the oil-rich Caspian Sea region, setting up a \"command and control\" centre just miles from the Iranian border. The company was also hired to protect emergency operations and facilities in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, where it raked in $240,000 (&pound;120,000) a day from the American taxpayer, billing $950 (&pound;470) a day per Blackwater contractor.<P>Yet this is still just a fraction of the company's business. It also runs an impressive domestic law-enforcement and military training system inside the US. While some of its competitors may have more forces deployed in more countries around the globe, none have organised their troops and facilities more like an actual military.<P>At present, Blackwater has forces deployed in nine countries and boasts a database of 21,000 additional troops at the ready, a fleet of more than 20 aircraft, including helicopter gun-ships, and the world's largest private military facility - a 7,000-acre compound in North Carolina. It recently opened a new facility in Illinois (Blackwater North) and is fighting local opposition to a third planned domestic facility near San Diego (Blackwater West) by the Mexican border. It is also manufacturing an armoured vehicle (nicknamed the Grizzly) and surveillance blimps.<P>The man behind this empire is 38-year-old Erik Prince, a secretive, conservative Christian who once served with the US Navy's special forces and has made major campaign contributions to President Bush and his allies. Among Blackwater's senior executives are J Cofer Black, former head of counterterrorism at the CIA; Robert Richer, former deputy director of operations at the CIA; Joseph Schmitz, former Pentagon inspector general; and an impressive array of other retired military and intelligence officials. Company executives recently announced the creation of a new private intelligence company, Total Intelligence, to be headed by Black and Richer. Blackwater executives boast that some of their work for the government is so sensitive that the company cannot tell one federal agency what it is doing for another.<P>In many ways, Blackwater's rapid ascent to prominence within the US war machine symbolises what could be called Bush's mercenary revolution. Much has been made of the administration's \"failure\" to build international consensus for the invasion of Iraq, but perhaps that was never the intention. Almost from the beginning, the White House substituted international diplomacy with lucrative war contracts. When US tanks rolled into Iraq in March 2003, they brought with them the largest army of \"private contractors\" ever deployed in a war.<P>While precise data on the extent of American spending on mercenary services is nearly impossible to obtain, Congressional sources say that the US has spent at least $6bn (&pound;3bn) in Iraq, while Britain has spent some &pound;200m. Like America, Britain has used private security from firms like ArmorGroup to guard Foreign Office and International Development officials in Iraq. Other British firms are used to protect private companies and media, but UK firms do their biggest business with Washington. The single largest US contract for private security in Iraq has for years been held by the British firm Aegis, headed by Tim Spicer, the retired British lieutenant-colonel who was implicated in the Arms to Africa scandal of the late 1990s, when weapons were shipped to a Sierra Leone militia leader during a weapons embargo. Aegis's Iraq contract - essentially coordinating the private military firms in Iraq - was valued at approximately $300m (&pound;1147m) and drew protests from US competitors and lawmakers.<P>At present, a US or British special forces veteran working for a private security company in Iraq can make $650 (&pound;320) a day, after the company takes its cut. At times the rate has reached $1,000 (&pound;490) a day - pay that dwarfs that of active-duty troops. \"We got [tens of thousands of] contractors over there, some of them making more than the secretary of defense,\" John Murtha, chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee, recently said. \"How in the hell do you justify that?\"<P>In part, these contractors do mundane jobs that traditionally have been performed by soldiers, from driving trucks to doing laundry. These services are provided through companies such as Halliburton, KBR and Fluor and through their vast labyrinth of subcontractors. But increasingly, private personnel are engaged in armed combat and \"security\" operations. They interrogate prisoners, gather intelligence, operate rendition flights, protect senior occupation officials - including some commanding US generals - and in some cases have taken command of US and international troops in battle. In an admission that speaks volumes about the extent of the privatisation, General David Petraeus, who is implementing Bush's troop surge, said earlier this year that he has, at times, not been guarded in Iraq by the US military but \"secured by contract security\". At least three US commanding generals are currently being guarded in Iraq by hired guns.<P>\"To have half of your army be contractors, I don't know that there's a precedent for that,\" says Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a member of the House oversight and government reform committee, which has been investigating war contractors. \"There's no democratic control and there's no intention to have democratic control here.\"<P>The implications, still unacknowledged by many US lawmakers and world leaders four years into this revolution, are devastating. \"One of the key tenets of managing international crises in the aftermath of the cold war was established in the first Gulf war,\" says a veteran US diplomat, Joe Wilson, who served as the last US ambassador to Iraq before the 1991 Gulf war. \"It was that management of these crises would be a coalition of like-minded nation states under the auspices of a United Nations Security Council resolution which gave the exercise the benefit of international law.\" This time, \"there is no underlying international legitimacy that sustains us throughout this action that we've taken.\"<P>Moreover, this revolution means the US no longer needs to rely on its own citizens and those of its nation-state allies to staff its wars, nor does it need to implement a draft, which would have made the Iraq war politically untenable. Just as importantly, perhaps, it reduces the figure of \"official\" casualties. In Iraq alone, more than 900 US contractors have been killed, with another 13,000 wounded. The majority of these are not American citizens and these numbers are not counted in the official death toll at a time when Americans are increasingly disturbed by their losses.<P>In Iraq, many contractors are run by Americans or Britons and have elite forces staffed by well-trained veterans of powerful militaries for use in sensitive actions or operations. But lower down, the ranks are filled by Iraqis and third-country nationals. Hundreds of Chilean mercenaries, for example, have been deployed by US companies such as Blackwater and Triple Canopy, despite the fact that Chile opposed the invasion and continues to oppose the occupation of Iraq. Some of the Chileans are alleged to be seasoned veterans of the Pinochet era.<P>Some 118,000 of the estimated 180,000 contractors in Iraq are Iraqis. The mercenary industry points to this as encouraging: we are giving Iraqis jobs, albeit occupying their own country in the service of a private corporation hired by a hostile invading power. As Doug Brooks, the head of the Orwellian-named mercenary trade group, the International Peace Operations Association, argued early in the occupation, \"Museums do not need to be guarded by Abrams tanks when an Iraqi security guard working for a contractor can do the same job for less than one-50th of what it costs to maintain an American soldier. Hiring local guards gives Iraqis a stake in a successful future for their country. They use their pay to support their families and stimulate the economy. Perhaps most significantly, every guard means one less potential guerrilla.\"<P>In many ways, however, it is the exact model used by multinational corporations that depend on poorly paid workers in developing countries to staff their highly profitable operations. This keeps prices down in the industrialised world and consumers numb to the reality of how the product ends up in their shopping basket.<P>\"We have now seen the emergence of the hollow army,\" says Naomi Klein, whose forthcoming book, The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, explores these themes. \"Much as with so-called hollow corporations such as Nike, billions are spent on military technology and design in rich countries while the manual labour and sweat work of invasion and occupation is increasingly outsourced to contractors who compete with each other to fill the work order for the lowest price. Just as this model breeds rampant abuse in the manufacturing sector - with the big-name brands always able to plead ignorance about the actions of their suppliers - so it does in the military, though with stakes that are immeasurably higher.\"<P>In the case of Iraq, what is particularly frightening is that the US and UK governments could give the public the false impression that the occupation was being scaled down, while in reality it was simply being privatised. Indeed, shortly after Tony Blair announced that he wanted to withdraw 1,600 soldiers from Basra, reports emerged that the British government was considering sending in private security companies to \"fill the gap left behind\".<P>Outsourcing is increasingly extending to extremely sensitive sectors, including intelligence. The investigative blogger RJ Hillhouse, whose site <a href=\"http://www.TheSpyWhoBilledMe.com\">TheSpyWhoBilledMe.com</a> regularly breaks news on the clandestine world of private contractors and US intelligence, recently established that Washington spends $42bn (&pound;21bn) annually on private intelligence contractors, up from $18bn in 2000. Currently, that spending represents 70% of the US intelligence budget.<P>But the mercenary forces are also diversifying geographically: in Latin America, the massive US firm DynCorp is operating in Colombia, Bolivia and other countries as part of the \"war on drugs\" - US defence contractors are receiving nearly half the $630m in US military aid for Colombia; in Africa, mercenaries are deploying in Somalia, Congo and Sudan and increasingly have their sights set on tapping into the hefty UN peacekeeping budget; inside the US, private security staff now outnumber official law enforcement. Heavily armed mercenaries were deployed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, while there are proposals to privatise the US border patrol. Brooks, the private military industry lobbyist, says people should not become \"overly obsessed with Iraq\", saying his association's member companies \"have more personnel working in UN and African Union peace operations than all but a handful of countries\".<P>Most worryingly of all, perhaps, powers that were once the exclusive realm of national governments are now in the hands of private companies whose prime loyalty is to their shareholders. CIA-type services, special operations, covert actions and small-scale military and paramilitary forces are now on the world market in a way not seen in modern history.<P>While the private military/security industry rejects the characterisation of their forces as mercenaries, Blackwater executives have turned the grey area in which they operate into a brand asset. The company has been quietly marketing its services to foreign governments and corporations through an off-shore affiliate, Greystone Ltd, registered in Barbados.<P>In early 2005, Blackwater held an extravagant, invitation-only Greystone \"inauguration\" at the swanky Ritz-Carlton hotel in Washington, DC. The guest list for the seven-hour event included weapons manufacturers, oil companies and diplomats from the likes of Uzbekistan, Yemen, the Philippines, Romania, Indonesia, Tunisia, Algeria, Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Kenya, Angola and Jordan. Several of those countries' defence or military attaches attended. \"It is more difficult than ever for your country to successfully protect its interests against diverse and complicated threats in today's grey world,\" Greystone's promotional pamphlet told attendees. \"Greystone is an international security services company that offers your country or organisation a complete solution to your most pressing security needs.\"<P>Greystone said its forces were prepared for \"ready deployment in support of national security objectives as well as private interests\". Among the \"services\" offered were mobile security teams, which could be employed for personal security operations, surveillance and countersurveillance. Applicants for jobs with Greystone were asked to check off their qualifications in weapons: AK-47 rifle, Glock 19, M-16 series rifle, M-4 carbine rifle, machine gun, mortar and shoulder-fired weapons. Among the skills sought were: Sniper, Marksman, Door Gunner, Explosive Ordnance, Counter Assault Team.<P>While Blackwater has become one of the most powerful and influential private actors in international conflict since the launch of the war on terror, in many ways it is like a small, high-end boutique surrounded by megastores such as DynCorp, ArmourGroup and Erynis, operating in a $100bn industry. In fact, experts say, there are now more private military companies operating internationally than there are member nations at the UN.<P>\"I think it's extraordinarily dangerous when a nation begins to outsource its monopoly on the use of force ... in support of its foreign policy or national security objectives,\" says Wilson. The billions of dollars being doled out to these companies, he says, \"makes of them a very powerful interest group within the American body politic and an interest group that is, in fact, armed. And the question will arise at some time: to whom do they owe their loyalty?\"<P>Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat and a leading member of the House select committee on intelligence, echoes those fears. \"The one thing the people think of as being in the purview of the government is the use of military power. Suddenly you've got a for-profit corporation going around the world that is more powerful than states\".<P><b>At war with the Pentagon </b><P>How Rumsfeld paved the way for Blackwater<P>The world was a very different place on September 10 2001, when Donald Rumsfeld stepped on to the podium at the Pentagon to deliver one of his first major addresses as defense secretary under President George W Bush. For most Americans, there was no such thing as al-Qaida, and Saddam Hussein was still the president of Iraq. Rumsfeld had served in the post once before - under President Gerald Ford, from 1975 to 1977 - and he returned to the job in 2001 with ambitious visions. That September day, in the first year of the Bush administration, Rumsfeld addressed the Pentagon officials in charge of overseeing the high-stakes business of defence contracting - managing the Halliburtons, DynCorps and Bechtels. The secretary stood before a gaggle of former corporate executives from Enron, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Aerospace Corporation whom he had tapped as his top deputies at the department of defense, and he issued a declaration of war.<P>\"The topic today is an adversary that poses a threat, a serious threat, to the security of the United States of America,\" Rumsfeld thundered. \"This adversary is one of the world's last bastions of central planning. It governs by dictating five-year plans. From a single capital, it attempts to impose its demands across time zones, continents, oceans and beyond. With brutal consistency, it stifles free thought and crushes new ideas. It disrupts the defence of the United States and places the lives of men and women in uniform at risk.\"<P>Pausing briefly for dramatic effect, Rumsfeld - himself a veteran cold warrior - told his new staff, \"Perhaps this adversary sounds like the former Soviet Union, but that enemy is gone: our foes are more subtle and implacable today. You may think I'm describing one of the last decrepit dictators of the world. But their day, too, is almost past, and they cannot match the strength and size of this adversary. The adversary's much closer to home. It's the Pentagon bureaucracy.\"<P>Rumsfeld called for a wholesale shift in the running of the Pentagon, supplanting the old department of defense bureaucracy with a new model, one based on the private sector. The problem, Rumsfeld said, was that unlike businesses, \"governments can't die, so we need to find other incentives for bureaucracy to adapt and improve.\" The stakes, he declared, were dire - \"a matter of life and death, ultimately, every American's.\"<P>That day, Rumsfeld announced a major initiative to streamline the use of the private sector in the waging of America's wars and predicted his initiative would meet fierce resistance. \"Some might ask, 'How in the world could the secretary of defense attack the Pentagon in front of its people?'\" Rumsfeld told his audience. \"To them I reply, I have no desire to attack the Pentagon; I want to liberate it. We need to save it from itself.\"<P>The next morning, the Pentagon would literally be attacked as American Airlines Flight 77 - a Boeing 757 - smashed into its western wall. Rumsfeld would famously assist rescue workers in pulling bodies from the rubble. But it didn't take long for him to seize the almost unthinkable opportunity presented by 9/11 to put his personal war on the fast track.<P><b>&#183; </b>An extract from Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army (published by Serpent's Tail, price &pound;12.99). &copy; 2007 Jeremy Scahill.

Leach and a local anthropologist in northern Nigeria uncovered the reasons for villagers' fears about taking the polio vaccine, administered to them by the World Health Organisation. Polio was either not seen as a priority, they found, or it was perceived as a spiritual affliction that was impossible to prevent. Leach argued that the polio vaccination campaign was using resources that weakened, rather than strengthened, local primary care health systems.</p><p>You might expect the daughter of Penelope Leach, one of the world's leading childcare academics, and Gerald Leach, an energy analyst who died three years ago, to be a high-flier.

Fairhead is head of the anthropology department at Sussex. The pair met as PhD students and, as Leach puts it, \"hatched their plan\" to go to Guinea with a grant from the Department for International Development. By the time they were halfway through their fieldwork, they were married.</p><p><strong>Intellectual partnership</strong></p><p>They have an intense intellectual relationship, having written four papers together. \"One of us will talk and the other taps away at the keyboard,\" she says. \"We disagree, we shout a bit, and then we sort it out - and have greater confidence in what we have written. Our intellectual partnership is a key part of what links us.\"</p><p>With their four children, they are an anthropological family - they bring to mind the animated Wild Thornberrys on TV - and fieldwork in Guinea, Trinidad and Gambia is very much a collective effort. \"The children help us by opening social doors in a society where having children is very important and where being a family gives social acceptance,\" Leach says.</p><p>She is glad her children have seen the \"cheery side\" to Africa - \"with children playing in rivers\" - that she thinks most of their peers will not have done.</p><p>But her responsibilities as a mother have, at times, weighed heavily on her. \"Once, all six of us were driving in a remote part of the Gambia, and we realised that the ignition key had fallen out of the car while we had passed through a national park.

His research - in Bethnal Green, Lagos, Nairobi, New York and Los Angeles - spanned rich and poor in both industrialised and developing countries. He witnessed human loss of different kinds, and in beautiful prose captured again and again what are the individual and social ramifications of \"loss and change\" - a theme that became the title of one of his later books.<P>Born in London, Peter attended Bryanston school, in Blandford, Dorset, an experience he said introduced him early to the pain of family separation. His national service was spent as an RAF translator in postwar Japan, shortly after the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We met in 1948 at Cambridge (he was at Clare College), where we read philosophy and psychology, sitting at the feet of Bertrand Russell, John Wisdom and Frederick Bartlett. He had already written a remarkable novel about Japan, but the publisher went bust. After finishing his degree, he joined the Colonial Service for two years as a district officer in Kenya.<P>Peter wrote a chapter about those years in Norman Mackenzie's Conviction (1958), entitled Accessory After the Fact. While his back was turned, a policeman had pumped bullets into an unarmed schoolboy only a yard away who was wearing a Boy Scout's belt. It was a crime, but Peter felt unable to act.<P>In his magnanimous and selfless piece about colonial policy, he remarked that \"in spite of the gross obscenities and outrageous cruelty of the Mau Mau rebellion, it compelled the sympathy of the Kikuyu people: it was, at last, something of their own, through which they could recover their respect for themselves ... It overcame their repugnance for the arbitrary terrorism of which they were themselves the victims. Good government is no substitute for self-government, especially since good government ends by using the methods which are used against it.\"<P>In 1955 Peter was persuaded to join Michael Young (obituary, January 16 2002), Peter Willmott (obituary, April 19 2000) and myself at the Institute of Community Studies in Bethnal Green. He stayed until 1972, and after contributing interviews to my book The Family Life of Old People (1957) became the most prolific - and international - of the small group of sociological devotees at the institute. Between 1958 and 1972 he published five books, the first being Widows and their Families (1958), a tender account of grief and mourning, and the first book in the UK on the subject of widowhood.<P>He wrote: \"For a while, she may become indifferent even to the care of her children: her home, her future, her family - nothing matters any more. Bewildered by her loss, she cannot at first believe it. She still hears his footsteps on the stairs, his voice calling, finds herself waiting for him when the men come home, and as each habitual expectation is unfulfilled, she begins to realise the meaning of his death ...\"<P>In 1958-59 Peter went back to Africa. In Family and Social Change in an African City (1961), he reported his interviews with families cleared from Lagos slums. He found that they had suffered acutely from bad planning and bungled rehousing. Many had been deprived of relatively secure work and social connections, and hundreds of plots from which families had been cleared remained unbuilt.<P>From 1966 to 1968 he overcame his early experiences in Kenya by going back to prepare and publish, with Anthony Somerset, African Businessmen (1971), a positive study of entrepreneurs and development. They interviewed a total of 1,271 figures in commerce and industry, some of whom had been awarded government loans. The worst problems were found to be overburdened management, conflicting loyalties, untrustworthy and demanding relatives, and social isolation.<P>In the years between these Africa books, Peter wrote The Experience of Higher Education (1964), a personal reflection on the ideals and purposes of higher education based on survey research in Cambridge, Leeds and Southampton universities and Northampton College of Advanced Technology. With Martin Rein, he wrote Dilemmas of Social Reform (1967), a demolition of the hopes raised by a range of community action projects designed to help the US poor. He and Rein visited 12 projects in different American cities. The launch of President Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty in 1964 had been beset by the contradictions of entrenched political and corporate interests, and the book set the scene for eventual disillusion with that war, despite small gains for some groups among the poorest fifth of the population.<P>From 1972 to 1976 Peter worked at the Centre for Environmental Studies, in London, but by the mid-1970s he took an increasing number of opportunities to visit the US. In 1976, he became professor in the school of architecture and urban planning in the University of California, Los Angeles, remaining there until 1991. It was a settled, happy and productive period. He married Dolores Hayden, now of Yale University, and became an US citizen. He published Loss and Change (1974), and lectured extensively on its themes of conservatism and innovation. He taught in the sociology department at Yale until 2004.<P>In Meaning and Action (1987), an expanded version of his earlier work, Community Planning and Conceptions of Change and the Politics of Uncertainty (1982), Peter extended psychiatric and psychological theories about individuals to the motives of national and international organisations and governments - an idea still rare in economic and social analysis. He wrote a fine novel, The Dreams of General Jerusalem (1988), about the interweaving of power, idealism and ambition in a new African nation and the forlorn ideas of American philanthropists anxious to leave their mark there. Conscious of human frailties, he invested all his prose with finely expressed insights that linger in the memory. In The P olitics of Uncertainty (1996) he wrote that personal attachments were the root of truly social security, \"a more hopeful politics of collaboration and reciprocity\".<P>He is survived by Dolores, his daughter Laura and his younger brother Tyrell.<P><b>&#183;</b> Peter Horsey Marris, sociologist, born July 6 1927; died June 25 2007<P><b>&#183;</b> This article was amended on Tuesday July 10 2007.

But what if they've been talking for seven hours?</p><p>\"If you're a new MP, and you want to make a speech in a debate, you just know you're going to get called last, so we're not talking about waiting around in the chamber for just half an hour here,\" said Jo Swinson, Liberal Democrat member for East Dunbartonshire, who at 27 is the youngest person in parliament. \"And when someone's saying over and over again what they could have said in five minutes ... well, multi-tasking really becomes very important then.\"</p><p>Perhaps it was only a matter of time before BlackBerrys and other wireless communication gadgets were permitted inside the chamber of the House of Commons. But given the usual pace of change at Westminster, you might have been thinking in terms of geological time. Instead, this week - just four years after BlackBerrys arrived in the UK - parliament's modernisation committee demanded that tradition give way, meaning that the ubiquitous email device will probably soon conquer the heart of British democracy. (Not that the invasion hadn't already begun. \"Many of us use them rather covertly, both in committees and in the chamber,\" the Labour MP Sir Peter Soulsby admitted during an evidence session.)</p><p>Capitulation to the addictive power of the \"crackberry\" has been less straightforward in France, where state defence experts have advised government staff not to use wireless devices to send and receive email for fear that foreign spy agencies - notably the Americans - might intercept their messages. Emails sent using BlackBerrys are routed through servers in the US and Britain. \"It's not a problem if you're writing to your mother-in-law,\" the French legislator Pierre Lasbordes told the Associated Press. But if a minister going to a G8 meeting \"sends information to his colleagues [and] it goes via Canada and the United States ... that's it. Game over.\"</p><p>Research In Motion, the Canadian company behind the BlackBerry, dismissed French fears, stressing that emails sent on its networks were more thoroughly encrypted than banking information on the internet. But as a demonstration of the BlackBerry's reach, the plaintive lament of one French ministry official, quoted in Le Monde, was far more telling than the dispute itself. \"We feel that we are wasting huge amounts of time,\" said the official, who was barred from using a BlackBerry, \"having to relearn how to work in the old way.\"</p><p>There was nothing in the circumstances of the BlackBerry's birth to suggest that it might snowball, in a few years, from a prototype in a laboratory to a device with 8m subscribers worldwide, many of whom curse their utter reliance on being always connected to email. Mike Lazaridis was the son of Greek immigrants who had worked on the production line at Chrysler in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river from America's great motor city, Detroit.</p><p>He dropped out of college when General Motors speculatively gave him a contract to start a hi-tech firm, and in 1984, with a $15,000 loan (&pound;7,500 at today's exchange rates) from his parents, he founded Research In Motion (RIM). Now he is worth $1.7bn, making him one of the world's richest people; he is regularly called Canada's answer to Bill Gates. Silver-haired Lazaridis, 46, divides his time between running the firm that created the BlackBerry and funding scientific research and educational programmes.</p><p>Things started slowly for Lazaridis: it took five years for the company to get the BlackBerry into the hands of 1m users, all of whom were based in North America. But the second million signed up in less than a year, and the company's most recent figures show that 1m more addicts were created in the last three months. It has long since trounced its rival firm Palm, which is now worth $1.7bn to RIM's more than $30bn. \"People want to work wherever they like,\" is how Charmaine Eggberry, who runs the company's European operations, sums up the gadget's fundamental appeal.</p><p>Or, at any rate, people think that they want to work wherever they like. RIM's well-planned marketing campaigns first targeted the American and British corporate elite, establishing the BlackBerry as a symbol of high status; employees on the next level down began to crave one, and the device began to sell itself. Few parts of the world are immune: some of the company's fastest-growing markets are in India, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, while in countries such as Nigeria, Kenya and Mauritius, the BlackBerry is helping some people leapfrog computer ownership altogether.</p><p>But the compulsion to check new messages the instant they arrive, and the ease with which employees can be contacted at any hour of any day, mean that some of the device's most devoted users are also its loudest detractors. Being connected electronically \"makes us feel alive [and] important,\" according to Linda Stone, the software executive who coined the phrase \"continuous partial attention\" to describe the hazy semi-focus of workers who are always connected to email and web-based social networks. \"Connect, connect, connect has brought us to a place where we feel overwhelmed, over-stimulated and unfulfilled,\" she told a technology conference last year. In April, when RIM's North American networks broke down for 10 hours, one major investment bank warned that deals might fall through; other users breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Research commissioned by RIM suggests that using a BlackBerry turns an hour of \"downtime\" into working time each day, increasing some users' efficiency by 38% as they manage to cram in extra work on the train, at home, or in the debating chamber. But research on the broader topic of electronic workplace interruptions offers an alarming alternative possibility: that connectedness is rendering us less effective. One landmark study, based on observations of workers at two American technology firms, found that people interrupted in the middle of a task took an average of 25 minutes to return to it - if, indeed, they returned to it at all. Edward Hallowell, a US psychiatrist, has identified a condition in some frequently interrupted workers which he labels \"attention deficit trait\".</p><p>\"A patient asked me whether I thought it was abnormal that her husband brings the BlackBerry to bed and lays it next to them while they make love,\" Dr Hallowell told Time magazine. The answer may seem obvious. But the BlackBerry didn't get where it is today by respecting traditional limits.

Converging technologies have caused alignments of world views to come into a frozen and mutually dysfunctional equilibrium. It is a world of high competition, conflicting values and little co-operation.</p><p>The headlines from the future. The group read out posts from the blogs of two young people born in 1985 - Joy Capulet and Ray Montague. (<a href=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/\">In fair Oxford, where we lay our scene</a>...) Joy's parents work in nanotechnology and genetics. Ray's father is a QC, and her mother is an organic farmer and environmental campaigner. Joy and Ray fall in love, but the families have never been warm but civil and polite in deference to the children.</p><p>At the wedding, Ray's parents raise a toast, but Joy's father says that future children will be great. \"Just look at what memory pills and cognition pills have done for Joy!\" The wedding breaks down into a riot.</p><p>Joy and Ray soldier on in their marriage. Joy becomes pregnant, but the pregnancy is terminated early on because genetic screening shows that the embryo carries the gene for breast cancer, a cancer that killed her mother. But the abortion strains the marriage. The next baby is conceived in the Oxford genetics lab. Even before his birth, she calls the baby Adonis. But Ray believes that this is a 'Frankenstein baby'. Their marriage is further strained. Joy says:</p><p style=\"text-indent:20pt;\">\"Of course it's your sperm dear. Only better.\"</p><p>Adonis born, beautiful, bright and already muscular. The baby shows signs of intelligence almost immediately. Adonis begins to talk at six months. Walks at 12 months. Reads soon after and declares: \"War and peace a boring read.\"</p><p>The traditional left-right alignments are re-organised but refrozen. The Capulets are the future 'enhanced' human beings. The Montagues represent the 'naturals'. They rarely talk to each other. It is a very scary world where you can start to see the outlines of speciation where more than one kind of human walks the earth.</p><p><strong>The competitive but regulated world</strong></p><p>This is a world where the regulations lag rapid innovation. The world is rapid in developing new technologies, but it's slow to learn from them. It has a lot of stop-start dynamics and reinforcing loops of behaviour. It returns to a question of how to regulate or manage what we don't know with uncertain developments in the future and also how to meet the challenges of globalisation.</p><p>1) One of the stories from this future world was super babies. There are monthly revolutions in embryonic care so people are delaying pregnancy to get the latest in in-vitro genetic modification. Older parents are increasingly hiring nannies to take care of these super babies. One genetic modification causes the arrested development of children. Another genetic modification causes death of the children. The EU sues US companies over the development of the genes. Parents are outraged over a perceived lack of justice.</p><p>Headline: Is genetic modification the new tobacco?</p><p>Years later, new regulations come into place, and the parents of the dead or stunted children feel that justice has been served.</p><p>2) Whose tubes are they anyway? China builds first nano-tube production plant in Kenya in 2010. WHO fears 'nano-Bhopal'. EU legislature calls for sound scientific review. China condemns international interference. Plant is on hold. 2012. Thousands of jobs in Kenya threatened by regulatory impasse. WTO and WHO have face-off in 2018. Regulatory agreement is reached, and The Economist headlines: The Rise of Nano-Africa.</p><p>3) Climate Change. In 2010, BP backs biofuel centre at Stanford (which is actually happening, the speaker says). Post Kyoto turns in stalemate. In 2020, carbon reductions don't emerge. The Chinese government takes action as coal burning power plants drive health care cost crisis. They develop cheap wind power, but have no way to store power. In 2025, GMOs are developed to drive bio-fuel development. Nano-tech delivers better battery storage for China's wind power. By 2030, there is a dramatic decrease in carbon emissions.</p><p><strong>The open, dynamic, co-operative world</strong></p><p>This group was an attempt to show a fast-paced world with open sharing of information and dynamic public-private cooperation. (They later renamed this the 'heterarchy'.)</p><p>1) Enhancements drive longer life. A public-private consortium comes together to discuss how to enhance and extend life. Initially, the sanctity of life is considered more important than lengthening life. But the public calls for life extension technologies to be developed. The work of life extension becomes open sourced, and it becomes a multi-trillion industry, with people living well into their 180s.</p><p>2) Another possible scenario in this world is the development of a super-horse. There is a discussion of whether to develop such a horse, if it is fair. But the consortium to develop the horse says that they will donate the winnings to needy children. The six-legged horse of the future wins the Royal Ascot, and needy children win.</p><p>3) This world is very connected and open. How do you manage under globalisation in a world filled with 'noise'. The logical, Enlightenment part of our brain cannot handle the noise. People are sensing their way through life, not just thinking our way through life. They can no longer handle the complexity. People begin to realise the power of this 'force' and focus on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity\">synchronicity</a>. A neural net, a non-technological human capability is developed to solve problems like climate change. Noise begins to build on the net initially. But converging technologies amplify 'signals' in the 'noise'. Global carbon emissions decrease. It is a connection of the human and the technological.</p><p><strong>The world of 'No Glue'</strong></p><p>This is hyper-competitive world where social connections fray. It's an extremely fluid and dynamic world. The roots of this begin in the late-1970s and early 1980s with something as innocuous as automatic direct debit. Bill payments and direct payments develop complex system. Initially, the systems just carried out your wishes, but the systems began to make decisions for you based on criteria. It caused highly complex, interdependent, fluid world. There is a high level of noise with very little 'signal'. Information bombards you, but it's unclear what is accurate.</p><p>Second Life and other virtual worlds go through iterative, rapid development. Financial markets found the virtual currencies and virtual markets of the future virtual worlds so much more efficient and profitable that billions of dollars, euros, yen, etc poured into them. Companies also found the regulation couldn't keep pace. The Linden Dollar becomes a global exchange currency.</p><p>News organisations were bought out by equity firms who used the news not to inform but simply to manipulate the virtual financial markets.</p><p>Initially, carbon levels rise as new virtual worlds rose and old ones built out increasingly.</p><p>China becomes the worlds 'matter compiler' and dominant manufacturer, but labour shifts from cheap labour market to cheap labour market until none exists. A true matter compiler is developed, and at least for the time being in the future, seven people in Luxembourg create all of the world's goods. The shift in production is expected to carry on, and already, people are looking for the next Luxembourg.</p><p>Now, virtual worlds become so dominate that travel becomes less important. Richard Branson's travel empire collapses.</p><p>Terrorism actually dies. No one cares enough to kill. High-intensity conflict ends but there is constant low-intensity conflict.</p><p>Languages come and go. This week it's Minanadarin - or minimum Arab-Mandarin - an SMS based pidgin that rose out of the convergence of virtual worlds in the Middle East and China.</p><p>The system never shuts down and indeed can never be shut down. It self-repairs. It replicates.</p><p>Now, virtual identity is as important as offline identity. And one headline that we read in the future is a man is accused of murder for shutting off a server, therefore, killing thousands of virtual identities.</p><p>This is a hyper-individual world where there are multiple identities in different worlds. Humans yearn for momentary belonging. Social connection is scarce, and there is a rise of hyper-egoism and distributed personal boundaries. It is a world, not of small pieces loosely joined, but rather 'mutually threatening pieces begrudgingly joined'.</p><p><a onclick=\"window.open('http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/noglue.jpg','popup','width=585,height=797,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false\" href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/noglue.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Glue world\" vspace=\"4\" hspace=\"4\" border=\"1\" width=\"73\" height=\"100\" src=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/noglue-tm.jpg\" align=\"left\"/></a><br/>I was with the group that developed this scenario.

Within minutes, they had gained on the bulky container ship. As he stood on the bridge of the MV Rozen, Captain Priayantha Perera sounded the alarm. He knew what was coming: pirates.<P>The Somali pirates who threw a pipe ladder on to his deck and boarded his ship went on to hold him and his 11 crew hostage at gunpoint for 41 days. The captives were released last month after a ransom, believed to be around $100,000 (&pound;50,000), was paid.<P>Piracy off the coast of Somalia is on the rise again. Last month, pirates seized two South Korean fishing vessels and are currently holding their crew hostage. Another gang attacked a cargo ship, the Ibn Younis, but the captain managed to outrun them. In another attack, pirates killed a guard who was among those sent to intercept an attempted hijack of a UN food aid ship.<P>The increase in attacks, particularly on vessels carrying aid for the World Food Programme, led the UN last week to call for international action. The agency's executive director, Josette Sheeran, said: \"We urge key nations to do their utmost to address the plague of piracy, which is now threatening our ability to feed one million Somalis. Unless action is taken now, not only will our supply lines be cut, but also those of other aid agencies in various parts of Somalia.\"<P>Somalia has had no officially recognised government since 1991 and it is believed that the pirates are run by local warlords, the funds raised used to arm local militias. Lloyd's List has blacklisted the Somali coast for insurance purposes.<P>Last month's attacks, at least 180 nautical miles from shore, mark a new strategy and confirm fears that the pirates are becoming better funded and equipped - they now use satellite phones and GPS to track their prey. That same technology allows large container ships to operate with smaller crews, making them easier to overpower.<P>\"When the pirates got close I could see that we were surrounded. I had no choice but to stop the ship - we couldn't outrun them and I could not allow them to start firing at my crew, many of them have very young children,\" Capt Perera, 53, recalled in Mombasa, Kenya, while waiting for his ship to be repaired.<P><b>Ransom</b><P>The crew's ordeal began on March 25, just after they had discharged their cargo of WFP food aid in Merca, a port south of the Somali capital, Mogadishu.<P>When the pirates boarded the ship, they stuck an AK47 in the captain's belly and took him to his cabin to steal the money in his safe. But Capt Perera knew that the gunmen's real aim would be to negotiate a ransom for the crew's release. \"They told me they wanted $1m and I told them, 'go to hell, forget about it, the ship's owners don't have that kind of money, you can go on and kill us one by one',\" he said.<P>Three days after the ship was taken, it was tracked by coastguards from the semi-autonomous Somali state of Puntland.<P>\"The Puntland coastguard started firing at us,\" said Capt Perera. \"The pirates fired warning shots, but the coastguards wouldn't stop shooting. They [the pirates] were all high on qat and that makes things even more dangerous. I thought 'we are finished now'. I got on the radio and begged the coastguard, \"Please, please, stop firing ... They kept on firing and hitting all over the bridge, it was filled with smoke and there were pieces of glass flying everywhere.\"<P>Athule Mahanama, the chief engineer, said: \"It was terrifying. A bullet came through the bridge and just missed my stomach.\"<P>The pirates forced the captain to take the ship further north, out of the Puntland jurisdiction and into lawless waters near the coastal town of Eyl.<P>When Karim Kudrati, the manager of the Rozen, got a call saying his crew were being held hostage, he knew what to expect; three other vessels owned by his company, Motaku Shipping Agencies, and all carrying aid had been attacked by pirates. The crew of one vessel had been held for 100 days.<P>\"The ransom negotiations are done in secrecy; no names or receipts are given. Everything is done in Somalia, with the help of the Somali contractors we work with and local elders,\" he explained.<P>But it is not just ships carrying aid that have fallen foul of the pirates. Crucial shipping lanes pass through Somali waters, allowing ships carrying oil, gas, and even tourists from the Indian Ocean into the Red Sea. In 2005 there were 47 incidences of piracy, including one on the cruise ship the Seabourn Spirit, with 22 British tourists on board, which was foiled with the aid of a sonic boom gun.<P>In the unlikely setting of Barking, east London, Captain Pottengal Mukundan heads the International Maritime Bureau's piracy reporting centre, where incidents are recorded and warnings issued. He advises all ships to sail at least 200 nautical miles from the Somali shore. There have been six attacks there since April, each one more daring.<P>\"There has been an upsurge in violent attacks off Somalia, with some taking place around 210 miles away, affecting victim vessels which have nothing to do with the Somali trade. Unless the interim government of Somalia can live up to its promises of controlling maritime piracy and reining in the local militias, we fear the attacks will reach unprecedented levels. They are going further and further than before.\"<P>Last June, the Union of Islamic Courts took control of southern Somalia, but they were routed in December by Ethiopian-backed forces. Under the UIC, piracy declined. Capt Mukundan explained: \"The UIC made an announcement that anyone caught committing piracy would be dealt with under sharia law. The attacks died down.\"<P>In one instance last October, he says, the UIC gave chase after pirates took a cargo vessel. They captured the pirates and returned the ship to its owners. \"We have not seen action of this kind in Somalia for decades,\" he says. \"But the interim government took control and the old militias regained their power and the attacks have started again.\"<P><b>Further attacks</b><P>From his own experience, Capt Perera predicts worse to come. \"The lion's share of the ransom money goes to these militias. Unless they clear the area between Puntland and Mogadishu of militias, they will not be able to stop these pirates ... The pirates who took us told me they were no longer interested in small ships - their main aim is to get tankers and big container ships. They are aiming for British, American, Japanese and Korean vessels. They know that's where the money is.\"<P>The threat to British shipping has not gone unnoticed. Last year, a British parliamentary select committee said practical government action was \"woefully inadequate ... The government does not even know the scale of the problem. That is failure by any measure.\"<P>Despite the prospect of further attacks, the MV Rozen will head back to Somalia. Mr Kudrati says he has no option. \"We totally depend on Somalia for our business and the WFP and Care International rely on us to deliver relief to needy people. We don't have any choice but to continue sailing.\"<P>Salim Hanafi, a 27-year-old oiler on the Rozen, agrees: \"When we were captured I thought about my children. Who will provide for them if I die? Now I am going back to Somalia... There's nowhere else to go, except that place.\""},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/12/audreygillan.international","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2007/jun/12/audreygillan.international","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"William Gumede: Right to be suspicious","webPublicationDate":"2007-06-11T23:10:10Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2007/jun/12/comment.politics","fields":{"body":"Post-G8 report cards are for the most part judging that the emphasis in Germany last week was on climate change, with the fight against poverty in Africa and the developing world taking a back seat. In truth, however, the two are so closely intertwined that they cannot be considered separately. Just as skewed global trade and political systems stack the deck against developing countries struggling to escape the poverty trap, it also limits their scope for effective action on climate change.<P>Progressive efforts to tackle climate change in Africa and the developing world are almost invariably hamstrung by global political, trade and finance rules and realities. Attempts to crack down on energy leakage are too often stymied simply because the mostly international corporations affected can threaten to pack up and move. Poor countries are desperately dependent on investments and jobs from these western companies.<P>Many developing countries have high levels of carbon emissions because they use so-called dirty fuel such as coal to generate the bulk of their energy. These countries worry about the cost of rapidly turning to sustainable energy, when they have massive social obligations to their poor citizens. More than 25% of households in South Africa, for example, do not have access to affordable energy, let alone clean energy.<P>The conversion from dirty to clean fuel is expensive. And here there is a telling echo of struggles for antiviral drugs in Africa: countries pursuing new technology to produce cleaner energy affordably often face battles with western companies and governments over intellectual property rights issues.<P>The people of Africa and the developing world understandably worry that they will find themselves left bearing the brunt of climate change, just as they have regarding health issues. The latest reports from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have identified Africa as the continent likely be hardest hit by climate change, thanks to plummeting food production and water shortages. And yet the industrialised countries are disproportionately responsible for global warming. The big developing countries - China, India and Brazil - are not blameless, but the western track record is hardly an example to follow.<P>After the G8 meeting, many welcomed the news that the United States had agreed that a future deal on the environment would be cobbled together under the auspices of the United Nations. However, the UN is viewed by many in Africa with distrust, especially following its apparent manipulation by the US and \"coalition of the willing\" in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq. There is little confidence that a fair deal will be agreed. At the UN-sponsored Africa climate change event in Kenya last year, Africans were watching powerlessly from the margins, as they were excluded from discussions that concerned them most.<P>If the G8 is serious about climate change in Africa and the developing world, one proposal is to refocus the World Bank to help poor nations overcome the cost of shifting to clean energy. Only the G8 nations have the power to achieve that.<P>It is no wonder that the large developing countries are suspicious of western attempts so far to persuade them to opt for a greener, and more costly, option to catch up with the west. Indeed, some developing countries perceive the clamour over climate change as an attempt by the west to dominate the world's depleting energy sources. Others, such as China, India and Brazil, suspect an ulterior motive on the part of a western world anxious about their high growth rates. These positions may be wrong, but they are certainly understandable.<P>Global warming has a disproportionate impact on poor countries, but it is, almost by definition, a pressing issue everywhere and for everyone. It cannot, however, be tackled in isolation, divorced from the other problems facing Africa and the developing world. Rich nations would be foolish to imagine that the fight against poverty can be postponed in favour of a focus on climate change. The solution to both demands an equitable partnership in decision-making and restoration of trust between the west and the developing world, and that must begin with genuine efforts to change the inequitable global trade, political and financial systems.<P><b>&#183; </b>WM Gumede is senior associate and Oppenheimer fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford, and author of Thabo Mbeki and the Battle for the Soul of the ANC <a href=\"mailto:williamgumede@yahoo.com\">williamgumede@yahoo.com</a>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/12/comment.politics","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/12/comment.politics","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"World's great apes face disaster, says Leakey","webPublicationDate":"2007-05-31T02:21:50Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2007/may/31/climatechange.conservation","fields":{"body":"<p>One of the world's most prominent conservation experts yesterday issued a rallying cry to save the great apes, man's closest biological cousins, which are under serious threat of extinction.</p><p>Richard Leakey, former head of the Kenya wildlife service and now chair of Wildlife Direct, said apes across the world faced unprecedented threats from the combined effects of hunting, disease and logging. And he said efforts to tackle global warming through the use of biofuels could cause more damage to ape populations because of pressure to chop down their tropical forest homes.</p><p>About 80% of orang-utan habitat in south-east Asia has been destroyed in the past 20 years because of soaring demand for land to produce palm oil for western markets. Experts warn that increased uptake of alternative fuels could mean the disappearance of the remaining 50,000 animals there within a generation.</p><p>Dr Leakey, who will outline his concerns in a public lecture tonight at the Royal Geographical Society in London, said human activity was directly to blame for the deaths of millions of gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos across the world. He urged politicians working on a new international treaty to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to focus more on incentives to conserve forests across south-east Asia, Africa and central and south America.</p><p>Dr Leakey said: \"People shrug their shoulders and say what are poor countries to do if they can't export their natural resources, and I understand this, but it is simply not sustainable the way it is going. The threat to great ape populations around the world is growing visibly.\"</p><p>He said preventing deforestation would help curb global warming as well as preserving endangered apes. Carbon released by deforestation is reckoned to account for 25% of all human greenhouse gas emissions, second only to the energy generation sector.</p><p>Scientists say conserving forests offers one of the cheapest ways to tackle climate change, and steps to reward tropical countries which leave their forests untouched will be discussed at the G8 summit in Germany next week.</p><p>Dr Leakey, a patron of a United Nations Environment Programme great apes survival project, called for more \"imaginative\" solutions such as credits for preserving biodiversity and wildlife habitats which a country could sell to others to offset their carbon pollution. \"We find it very hard to preserve natural beauty, but we are happy to spend &pound;80m on a Picasso and a fortune looking after it.\"</p><p>But he insisted developing countries must take their share of responsibility for global warming. \"Developing countries are shrill about the damage that developed countries have caused with their pollution,\" he said. \"The developing world should have a comparable amount of responsibility because of deforestation. I don't think we [Kenya] can afford to shelter behind the fact that we're a new country and we were grossly exploited before, and so we need to be given a break. We need to look at the effect we're having on the whole planet.\"</p><p>He called for a \"huge revolution in entrepreneurial skills\" to develop technology such as nuclear fusion and hydrogen power as a way of limiting the need for biofuels. \"The whole biofuel issue is of great concern. And it's not just biofuels, the destruction of rainforest to make way for palm oil plantations is extraordinary.\"</p><p>A UN report this month also raised concerns over a rapid expansion of biofuels, saying they could have an irreversible environmental impact. There are also concerns about their impact on global food prices, with growing competition for scarce land resources.</p><p>Dr Leakey said the direct effects of climate change could spell disaster for the great apes. \"I don't think we can say enough to stimulate concern over climate change. It's a complex process but it will undoubtedly impact on everything we know and the implications for biodiversity are there for all to see. We don't know the tolerance of plants to the predicted temperature changes. We should not for a minute assume that forests, rivers and lakes are permanent features of our landscape.\"</p><p>He also criticised what he called the \"oxymoron\" of ecotourism, which he said was based on \"a desperate race to make money while you still can\". He said: \"An awful lot of damage is done under the umbrella of ecotourism. The tourism industry needs to be talked to very seriously about setting standards that are something other than profit-motivated.\"</p><p><strong>Profile: Richard Leakey</strong></p><p>Born in Kenya in 1944 to two esteemed anthropologists, Richard Leakey led expeditions which uncovered a steady stream of human-ancestor fossils during the 1970s which dazzled the scientific world and helped to clarify our evolutionary history. Among the most important finds are the remains of Turkana Boy, a 1.6m-year-old Homo erectus skeleton, recovered virtually intact, as well as the 2.5m-year-old Black Skull, which forced palaeontologists to drastically rethink the structure of the human family tree.</p><p>In 1969 he was diagnosed with a terminal kidney disease and a decade later received a lifesaving transplant from his younger brother.</p><p>In the 1980s he devoted more of his time to Kenya's museums and, subsequently, conservation issues.

In the letter, in surprisingly short order, she asked me to drop whatever I was doing and help a refugee from Sudan tell the story of his life. It was a pretty unusual letter.</p><p>I had heard of the Lost Boys. There had been a slew of articles about them in the American media that year, and I read about the group with the same fascination as anyone else. I knew that 3,800 young Sudanese men - called Lost Boys because they had been unaccompanied minors for much of their 13 years in Ethiopian and Kenyan refugee camps - had recently been resettled in cities across the United States, in groups numbering from 20 to 400. I knew that the young men, as boys, had fled their villages in southern Sudan as the civil war raged in the mid-1980s, and that none had returned home since. They'd been placed in cities such as Jacksonville and Fargo and San Jose, areas chosen not for their similarity to Sudan, but for their affordability and positive attitude towards international immigrants. There were 180 Lost Boys in Atlanta, and the Lost Boys Foundation was active in helping them find jobs, mentors and educational opportunities.</p><p>And they needed a lot of help. In almost all cases, the young men had never had jobs, had never seen refrigeration (let alone ice), had never driven a car or been in a grocery store. The US government, which had done a very good thing by admitting thousands of penniless young Sudanese men into the country, had perhaps underestimated the difficulties they would experience in adjusting to life in America. The refugees were given three months of financial support - about $800 - and thereafter were more or less on their own.</p><p>In that first letter and in subsequent phone calls, Mary (whose own story - born the daughter of Black Panthers and eventually adopted by Jane Fonda - would make a fine book) told me that she had got to know one young man, Valentino Deng, better than any other. He had moved to Atlanta in 2001 - his flight from Nairobi had originally been scheduled for 9/11 - and he was already well known as a captivating public speaker and spokesman for the Lost Boys in Atlanta. When she had asked him about his goals, beyond the hopes he shared with virtually all the other Lost Boys - go to college, get a good job, send money back to Sudan, build a family - he had said that he wanted his story told. He wanted his story to serve as the specific that might illuminate the universal - the lives of the 20,000 or so young Sudanese who had also seen what he had seen of the war. Valentino was not proficient enough in written English at that point to write the book himself, but nevertheless he felt that what had happened in the civil war in southern Sudan, still raging in 2002, needed to be documented. If his story was told and told well, he thought, it might convey to the world the realities of the conflict and its effect on the people there.</p><p>A few months later, in January 2003, I met Valentino at a birthday celebration for about 200 Lost Boys living in Atlanta and in nearby cities. When processed as refugee children, the young Sudanese had all been given the same birthday, New Year's Day - a common practice for young refugees who don't know their exact date of birth - and now the young men in the US had established a tradition of marking their fictional birthdays together.</p><p>After the party, Valentino and I spent the rest of the weekend at his small apartment on the outskirts of the city. There, we began the process of recording his story, from the first days of the war to the present. It's hard to explain how or why, but we both knew, from those first days together, that the project was real, and that we would see it through. I promised I would write his story, and he promised to cooperate in every way he could. We both agreed that I would not be paid for the work, and that any and all proceeds from the book would be his to use or distribute however he saw fit. He knew immediately that he would send most of the funds home to his village of Marial Bai, to build a school, a library, a community centre, and any number of other facilities. Then, that first weekend, I did a stupid thing: I promised Valentino that I would finish writing the story within one year. We both felt strongly that there was no time to waste. One year, tops, I told him.</p><p>It was one of the major mistakes of our early days together. The other great misconception we shared was that we were writing a story about the past. A ceasefire was in place in Sudan when we met, and there was hope that peace was at hand. So when we sat down to work on the book, we believed that the violence and incalculable suffering of the Sudanese people were at an end. Neither of us knew that the killing in Darfur was about to begin.</p><p><br />Valentino and I met up in Atlanta and San Francisco, spending days and weeks together, recording his story. We talked for hundreds of hours on the phone and sent thousands of emails back and forth. Though our rapport was easy, and we never argued over content or method, it's impossible to say that the process of writing the book was an enjoyable one. We were dealing with material that was very difficult for him to dredge up, and difficult for me to hear. On top of this was a central struggle for me - I had yet to figure out just how to write the book.</p><p>I had been working on a book of oral histories from the lives of public school teachers in the US, and had studied different methods of storytelling. So I assumed I would simply interview Valentino, straighten the narrative out a bit, ask some follow-up questions, and then assemble the book from his words. I even imagined for a while - much of our first year together - that I would simply be the editor of the book, not its author.</p><p>But after that first year of interviews and my first attempt to assemble the resulting narrative, we both realised that there were great limitations, in this case, to the oral history model. Valentino was six years old when he left his home and began his 800-mile journey to Ethiopia, and thus his memory of that time was very spotty. When we looked at what we had from our recording sessions, it was fascinating, but it did not transcend the many human rights reports and newspaper articles already available to the world. It was clunky, spare, and full of holes. In addition, a new book called They Poured Fire On Us From the Sky had just appeared, and it did much of what we had originally intended to do: it wove together the oral histories of three Lost Boys, and did so with great skill.</p><p>But though the form of the book was still unclear, I knew that we would have to return to southern Sudan, to Valentino's hometown of Marial Bai, if either one of us hoped to tell the story with any degree of accuracy. With the help of Mary, we secured a visa for Valentino to travel to Nairobi, and once there, I went about calling relief agencies working in southern Sudan, hoping to find a few seats on any plane flying into the region. Through a series of lucky phone calls, I was able to find an aid agency, Concern, that was willing to let us fly in the cargo hold of a plane that was dropping supplies throughout the south.</p><p>So, in December of 2003, Valentino and I travelled amid the bicycles and medicine and food of a humanitarian aid flight, the plane making four stops in the country along the way. When finally the plane was on its way to Marial Bai - there is a dirt airstrip that bisects the tiny town - the plane was empty, excruciatingly loud and Valentino's head throbbed from myriad pressures. He hadn't seen his parents since he was six, and didn't recognise the landscape as we descended. \"My heart is beating!\" he said, as the plane lowered its landing gear. He would be the first Lost Boy to return.</p><p>When Valentino stepped off the plane and on to the dusty dirt runway, he was quickly surrounded by easily a hundred people, moving in from all sides, calling out Achak, his given name. After a few seconds, an old man, frail and toothless, found his way through the crowd and put his hand on Valentino's shoulder. He spoke into Valentino's ear and they embraced. They pulled away from each other and Valentino looked into the old man's eyes and smiled. \"Hey,\" Valentino said over the throng, grinning widely. \"This is my father.\" After this brief reunion, which lasted no more than a minute, Valentino's father walked off. They would meet later, privately.</p><p>As the plane's cargo was unloaded and the Russian pilots climbed back into the cockpit, the crowd began to walk away from the airstrip and towards the village. Through the settling dust a violet-clad woman of about 60, weathered and very tall, with small hard eyes and a thin straight mouth, approached Valentino shyly.</p><p>\"Achak,\" she said to him quietly. \"I am your mother.\"</p><p>She held his face in her hands. Valentino yelled over the crowd - and again without fanfare - \"Hey! This is my mother!\"</p><p>They walked arm in arm for a few yards and through a corrugated metal door separating the runway from the compound run by Save the Children, which agreed to give Valentino and his family a degree of privacy. He walked through with about nine of his friends and relatives, his arm around his mother, whose head was on his shoulder, whose hand was on his heart. With tears in her eyes, she stared at Valentino in plain astonishment. \"Is it really you?\" she said to him again and again.</p><p>Soon she left, with plans to meet him later in the day. Once she was gone and the other visitors had departed, Valentino tried to smile but was clearly burdened. \"She has been very sick,\" he said. \"She will not live very long. She was afraid that she would die before seeing me again.\"</p><p>Valentino, usually so quick to smile and impossible to discourage, was weighed down those days in Marial Bai. His expression was very serious, and though he spent a good deal of time among his family and the people of the town, he often retreated into the Save the Children compound for hours at a time - overwhelmed by the demands made upon him, the people who wanted his attention. He couldn't believe the poverty. There was almost no livestock, and the homes, all made from mud and thatch, were small, temporary-seeming. We visited the hospital, one room resembling a cement bunker, where eight dilapidated beds were arranged. There were no windows, no sheets, no pillows, no doctors - there was only one man who dispensed medicine. The hospital's two patients, two women sitting on a bed, each with a baby on her lap, glared at us until we left.</p><p>The civil war has reportedly killed two million people, though the majority of those have died of starvation and disease. People could not farm because they didn't know when they would have everything taken from them - their fields burned, their livestock stolen. Schools opened only occasionally. With uncertainty the guiding state of mind, the war had effectively put life in Sudan on hold for 20 years.</p><p>It is a terrible emblem of desperation that people in any number of troubled countries have wished for, and in some cases continue to wish for, American military intervention in their affairs. When Valentino and I were biking on the airstrip one night, we heard a commotion by the Concern compound. We rode to the noise, and soon could make out a television - there were only a few televisions for perhaps a hundred miles - set on a table, outside, being powered by a generator. We dropped our bikes and joined the crowd of about 15 young Sudanese men watching CNN.</p><p>\"What happened?\" we asked one of the men.</p><p>\"They caught him,\" he said.</p><p>On the screen was the wretched face of Saddam Hussein, in his post-arrest mugshot. He looked haggard and half dead and crazed, and his capture was seen, by the assembled men, as a very good sign.</p><p>\"Next is Khartoum,\" one man said.</p><p>To them it meant that not only could American military might topple a murderous government in short order, but American and British soldiers could search out, find and bring to justice the dictators who oppressed their people.</p><p>And though the elders of the town had more realistic expectations of the US, they still put great faith in the west to bring them hope. On one of our last days in Marial Bai, Valentino and I met with the commissioner of the region, who attributed the peace process, then under way, to the suffering of the Lost Boys, and the Americans' awareness of their plight. He then put it to Valentino: \"Now that you're an American, what will you be doing with your life?\" This tipped the guilt Valentino already felt. He decided then that, though his life had been epic in the scale of its sorrow and deprivations, he had been lucky. Those who had stayed in southern Sudan during the war were far worse off. Once at the refugee camps, he knew he would be fed, he would be safe (most of the time), he would be educated. Those who had stayed in Marial Bai had no such guarantees.</p><p><br />When we returned from Sudan, Valentino and I were more committed than ever to getting his story into print as soon as we could. In an attempt to kickstart the writing of the book, I published an account of the trip in journalistic form in the Believer magazine. The exercise made clear, though, that my telling of Valentino's story, in my voice, would be distracting and tonally incorrect. In the account I wrote, I was present, both as narrator and as the guy riding in the cargo hold next to Valentino; there was no way to excise myself from the story. But in the book, I knew I had to disappear completely.</p><p>The first decision made that spring was to have Valentino narrate his story. His voice was so distinctive and powerful that any other way of telling it would be criminally weak by comparison. But my standards for what would qualify as non-fiction were strict; as a journalist, I was trained not to put any dialogue between quotation marks unless it was on tape. We had no such thing, and Valentino couldn't remember who said what at almost any point in his life, and thus the book would be without any dialogue at all.</p><p>So already we were straying from our intent - to bring Valentino's story to the general reader. Without sensory detail or dialogue, the book would be parched, and likely to reach only those already interested in the issues of Sudan. I was holed up in a cabin a few hours north of San Francisco, trying to figure out the book, when, after wrestling with all these problems for the year or so after our trip, I finally gave up. I was cornered. I couldn't make an interesting non-fiction account of his life - I do believe another writer could, but I personally couldn't - and a simple oral history wouldn't add anything significant to the material out there. I didn't know how I would tell Valentino that the thousands of hours he'd given to the process were for nothing, but I knew that I'd spent two years on it and didn't feel any closer to doing justice to his life and everything he wanted from the project.</p><p>Yet hours after I had given up - and I truly gave up - something occurred to me. Or many things occurred to me. First, I remembered that, at the refugee camp in Kakuma, in northern Kenya, Valentino had been part of a theatre group whose mandate was to write and perform one-act plays to educate the residents of the camp in various issues - HIV/Aids, gender equality, conflict resolution. So he knew that one usually needed to adapt the facts of life and shape them in such a way that they came alive in the minds of an audience.</p><p>By the same token, I realised that so many of the books I'd brought with me for inspiration, and the books I'd been reading on the shelves of this book-filled rented cabin, were novels. The books about war and upheaval that I'd turned to again and again, and that best (in my opinion) communicated the realities of war, were in fact novels: The Naked and the Dead, The Things They Carried, The Painted Bird, Catch-22 - War and Peace, for Christ's sake. Only with a bit of artistic licence could I imagine the thoughts in Valentino's mind the first day he left home, fleeing from the militias, never to return. Only in a novel could I imagine the look on the face of the man who rescued Valentino when he became entangled in barbed wire one black night in the middle of his journey to Ethiopia. Only in a novel could I apply what I had seen in the various regions of southern Sudan to describe the land, the light, the people.</p><p>I knew this was the only way I could do the book, but I put off calling Valentino with the idea. Although we'd never disagreed on anything involving the project, I thought he might think this step too extreme. I stalled for a few days, but when we finally spoke, he understood completely. \"You have to be a writer,\" he said. \"Do it the way you think it will best reach people.\"</p><p>I started anew, right then, finally thinking I could fulfil my promise to Valentino. The first thing I did in my new method was to reimagine Marial Bai, before the war. The book needed a sense of the town - and, by association, hundreds of similar places - before the coming of the conflict. The book needed to demonstrate, step by step, how the war unfolded, through the eyes of a tiny boy in a busy market town. Through my own research, I'd been able to pinpoint the series of events that led to all-out civil war, and combining these milestones with Valentino's memories, finally we were able properly and vividly to convey how the utopian dreams of a small group of well-meaning rebels can engulf an entire country in two decades of mayhem and mass murder.</p><p>Sudan had been in a state of civil war off and on since its independence from Britain in 1956; the conflict that swallowed southern Sudan began in 1983, when the Sudan People's Liberation Army, aiming to represent the needs of southern Sudan, rose up against the northern, Arab-dominated government in Khartoum. The SPLA and its leader John Garang demanded a greater share of the country's resources, better infrastructure and more autonomy for the south, among other things. In response, the government of Sudan instituted the \"to catch a fish, drain the pond\" method of warfare. The government armed and unleashed tribal militias upon hundreds of villages in the south. The militias - then known as the murahaleen but not dissimilar from the Janjaweed now at work in Darfur - were urged to depopulate the south, to wreak havoc and terror, and they were paid both directly and in booty. Whatever the militias could carry off from the villages was theirs to keep. They swooped into villages by the hundreds, killing men, raping women, burning homes and crops, and abducting girls and boys to be bought and traded as servants and sex slaves in the north. The Sudanese government also bombed southern villages with Russian-made Antonov planes and obstructed the delivery of aid and food to the region, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The level of mayhem at this stage of the war defies description.</p><p>But when Valentino and I met, the SPLA and the government of Sudan were negotiating a peace; the African Union, the US and the wider international community were involved in bringing all the parties to the table. The ceasefire they established has lasted to this day. In 2005, the government of Sudan and the SPLA signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, granting the south far greater autonomy, half of the country's oil profits and, most importantly, the ability to secede, should the people vote to do so, in 2011.</p><p>The strangest thing about all this is that while this peace agreement was being negotiated, the first killings were taking place in Darfur. A rebel group in western Sudan, the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA), rose up because of the negotiations going on between the SPLA and the government. The SLA (and, later, other groups) felt that if the SPLA could be successful in fighting for their share, they might as well give it a shot. And incredibly, while negotiating with the south under the watchful eye of the international community, the Sudanese government was allowed to revive its vicious civil war tactics for use against the civilians of Darfur. Again to punish a region's rebel movement, the government unleashed great fury upon its defenceless citizens. Again there were indiscriminate bombings, and again there was a brutal government-funded militia - the Janjaweed, known by Americans who work in the region as the KKK of Darfur, tasked with \"cleansing\" the region of black Muslims.</p><p>So while I struggled to write the book of Valentino's life, trying to uncover the truths of his early years and to untangle the story of the SPLA and its effect on the people of southern Sudan, he and I were watching what we had thought impossible: a step-by-step re-enactment of the war he had fled, only this time in another region of his country. Thus far in Darfur, the government of Sudan has been allowed to kill about 250,000 of its citizens in almost precisely the same manner in which they killed the people of southern Sudan. Year after year, since war broke out in Darfur in 2003, the government of Sudan has been allowed to pursue identical policies of mayhem. And though President Bush, among others, has called the killing in Darfur a genocide, this has not yet spurred the international community to stop the killing.</p><p><br />My daughter was born in October 2005, and after a few weeks, I began to take her on walks in the woods and hills near our home. The jostling of the walks usually put her to sleep within 20 minutes or so, but before she fell asleep, it was fascinating to see how she would react to her surroundings. She shunned bright light, closing her eyes tight. When we would pass into the shadow of a stand of eucalyptus, she would open her eyes again, and seem to concentrate on trees and ferns. And always, three or four times during any walk, she would sigh, a sigh far bigger than seemed possible for such a tiny creature.</p><p>I had never heard that newborns knew how to sigh. I know of course that their sighs do not mean for them what they mean for us. At that time, I was still struggling with the overall structure of the book, which had yet to be figured out in any real way. I had 600 pages of disconnected passages, and no interior architecture. The book was overdue and my inability to frame it, combined with my sense of powerlessness over Darfur - the killing was escalating, the chaos at a high point - gave my daughter's tiny sigh an outsized significance. Even she knows, I would think, of our impotence. Even she knows that most of our compassion is like so much mist, fleeting and inconsequential.</p><p>One night in the middle of this malaise, I got an email from Valentino, who was still living in Atlanta. The subject heading was \"A BAD DAY\". He explained that he had been mugged in his home, by people he didn't know who had knocked on his door asking to use his cellphone. When I called him, and when we saw each other soon after in San Francisco, he was more distraught than I had ever seen him. \"It's different,\" he explained. When he had been the target of militias, of Antonov bombers, of government troops, it had never been personal. Now there had been people in his apartment, one with a gun to his head, who truly seemed to despise him. There was an intimate aspect to the attack that was new to him, and was haunting him nightly. He wanted to leave Atlanta, to be away from the chaos of that and any other city.</p><p>He showed me the complaint card that the police had given him. It was a business card with a phone number on it. That was the extent of their worry about a gun to the head of an immigrant from Sudan. They would not, it was clear, be investigating the crime. We would walk in silence those days, Valentino and I, the baby sighing. We had no answers for anything.</p><p>It was at this time that I knew the book needed to be not only about Valentino's experiences in Sudan and the camps, but also about the many unforeseen struggles of his life in the US. The attack became the framing device for the book, and connected to something he had told me during our first weekend together. We had been talking about the small indignities he'd experienced taking the bus around Atlanta, trying to get to work. He had been pushed, ignored, disrespected. And each time he would think, silently, \"If only that person knew what I'd already been through ...\" He would direct his thoughts to whoever had treated him less than humanely, and hope for a day when his story was known far and wide, and that perhaps then his sufferings small and great would end.</p><p>This, in turn, connected with the creation myth that eventually became the title of the book. The book had originally been called It Was Just Boys Walking, then, for a while, Hello Children (after a textbook used in the camps), but soon those titles seemed inappropriate. Valentino had been a man for a long time now, and he and the other so-called Lost Boys were tired of being known as boys. The story of Valentino's life would need to be equally, if not more so, about the issues he faced today.</p><p>We had agreed that we would include in the book an ancient creation myth known in southern Sudan. In the story, God, pleased with his greatest creation, offers the first Dinka man a choice of gifts: on the one hand, the cattle, visible and known, an animal that can feed and clothe him and last for ever; on the other hand, the What. The man asks God, \"What is the What?\", but God will not reveal the answer. The What was unknown; the What could be everything or nothing. The Dinka man does not hesitate for long. He chooses the cattle, and for thousands of years Dinka lore held that he had chosen correctly; the cow is thus sacred in southern Sudanese culture, the measure of a family's wealth and the giver of life.</p><p>It was not until the torment of the southern Sudanese in the 20th century that the Dinka began to question this choice. What was the What, they wondered, and speculation about the answer abounded: was it technology? Education? Sophisticated weapons? Whatever the answer, it was assumed that the Arabs of the north - who, legend had it, had received the What - might have got the greatest of God's gifts, and were using this What to inflict unending pain upon the southern Sudanese.</p><p>Valentino and I had long thought the legend an apt expression for the themes of the book, and we planned to include the story in some way, but it was not until he was attacked in his home, amid the ongoing killing in Darfur, that this creation myth became the title of the book. It was clear then that not only did Valentino and the people of Sudan not know what the answer to the question was, but perhaps they weren't even asking the right questions.</p><p>Questions we might ask now: can influence be exerted in Sudan? Does the US, Britain and the rest of Europe have a responsibility to influence the Sudanese government? Absolutely. This is not an administration content to be an international pariah. But thus far there have been few adverse consequences for its actions in Darfur, few punitive measures. The US has proved that, when it wants to, it can have great and swift authority over the Sudanese government. It was the US, with Bush himself spearheading the process, that made a priority of negotiating a peace between the SPLA and Khartoum.</p><p>Why, then, are we moving so slowly and treading so gently with regard to Darfur? One possible explanation for Bush's apparent reluctance to intercede as quickly in Darfur as in southern Sudan is that there are hundreds of thousands of Christians in southern Sudan, whereas Darfur's victims are mainly Muslims. The war in Iraq has drained much of Bush's credibility abroad, and has clearly put a severe strain on his ability to negotiate for peace elsewhere. Perhaps most crucially, since 9/11 the Sudanese government has become an important ally - and source of information for the intelligence agencies - in Bush's war on terror. When What Is the What was published in the US, Valentino and I began to tour, feeling that its release coincided with a new and powerful wave of awareness and action directed towards Darfur. We spoke to students, to activists, to the informed and the uninformed.</p><p>One of our most trusted advisers in Sudanese affairs, John Prendergast of the International Crisis Group, told us that the worldwide temperature, in terms of pressure on the Sudanese government and awareness of the genocide, was at 101 degrees Fahrenheit. It needed, he said, to get up to 103. Then and only then, he said, would the genocide be stopped.</p><p>There were campaigns and protests around the country, and a range of innovative ways to hit Sudan's economic interests. Dozens of colleges divested from any holdings they had in Sudan, and cities and states followed. About 70,000 people removed their holdings from Fidelity, a mutual fund with holdings in China's oil interests in Sudan. Letters were written, congressmen were lobbied, films were shown, celebrities appeared on CNN. At the end of each talk we gave, Valentino and I implored the audience to do what they could to help Sudan generally and Darfur in particular. We offered the latest methods to make one's voice heard - including the most recent innovation, a phone number, 1-800-GENOCIDE, that linked directly to the White House switchboard. But as month after month went by, my own faith in what I was advocating began to diminish. I began to see change in Darfur as something perhaps beyond our grasp. I felt what I think many people felt at the time: utterly powerless, and quite close to without hope.</p><p>Then, what might very well be the most effective tactic yet was unveiled by none other than Mia Farrow. I was aware of Farrow's work as an ambassador with the UN over the years, but I was unprepared for the editorial she wrote in the Wall Street Journal, on March 28, in which she made a connection that I had not heard before, and one that, at first, seemed a bit extreme. Because China is the major buyer of Sudan's oil, and supplies the Sudanese government with cash and weapons, it has been a focus of Darfur activists for a long time. Farrow knew that the Chinese are very much looking forward to the Beijing Olympics in 2008. They even asked Steven Spielberg to film the opening ceremonies. So Farrow wrote an open letter to Spielberg in the Wall Street Journal, noting that if he continued to work with the Chinese without holding them partially to account, he might \"go down in history as the Leni Riefenstahl of the Beijing Games\".</p><p>It seemed like an almost cruel gambit, but it worked. Spielberg was unaware of the connection between China and Darfur, and he was outraged. He wrote a letter to President Hu, urging action. President Hu dispatched his foreign minister, Zhai Jun, to meet with Sudan's president, Omar al- Bashir. No one knows what was said behind closed doors, but the meeting revealed China's Achilles heel. Khartoum has now agreed in theory to accept UN peacekeepers in Darfur, and there are other encouraging developments. If the temperature was at 101 a few months ago, it's certainly at 102 now. And I was happy to be reminded, by the cumulative effect of all these efforts, public and private, obvious and cunning, that every one of them matters.</p><p><br />People have asked Valentino if he knows what the What is, if now he feels any closer to an answer. He doesn't feel any closer, no, and I don't feel any closer, but for now it's clear we need to continue to focus on the tangible, on doing the tough but obvious work right before us.</p><p>With a peace in place since 2005, Marial Bai has been able to rebound - cautiously but measurably. Valentino's father has rebuilt his shop, there are cellphones everywhere, roads now connect the town to trading centres throughout Sudan, Kenya and Uganda, and optimism abounds. In July, Valentino will return, this time with more than a burdened conscience. He intends to listen to the needs of the people, and then meld their ideas with his plans to build a 300-student high school, a library, a community centre, a teachers' college. The plans go on and on. The school should be first, it's been decided - bricks are already being made and stacked. It's estimated that about 150,000 bricks will be needed, so the work ahead is clear. The wet season is on the way, so they're working quickly to do what they can before the rains come.</p><p>\n<strong>&#183;</strong> What Is the What by Dave Eggers is published by Hamish Hamilton on Thursday (&#163;18.99)</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview29","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2007/may/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview29","sectionName":"Books"},{"webTitle":"Nick Clayton: From a laptop in Kenya comes the meaning of life","webPublicationDate":"2007-05-25T22:58:27Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2007/may/25/business.businesssolutions3","fields":{"body":"Despite the much-vaunted move towards mobile working it's hard to find \"martini jobs\", the sort you can do any time, anywhere. Then you could hit the road with a backpack, safe in the knowledge you could earn enough in a few hours to keep you going when needed.<P>Well, I've just been speaking to Ben Bradley who has been doing exactly that. And it's all on the basis of knowing, or knowing where to find out: Who is the only footballer to have scored a hat-trick in all four divisions? Who is Top Gear's \"The Stig\"? And, simply: What is the meaning of life? Read on and all will be revealed.<P>When I spoke to Ben he was just back from Paris where he had been taking a French course. Before that he had been in Kenya as a volunteer instructor helping with Aids awareness. \"I'm thinking of spending the summer in Croatia before I start a postgrad course in development management so I can work with NGOs, the UN or whatever.\"<P>All this has been financed through the hours Ben spends each week as a \"texpert\". This is a term coined by his employers 82ask, a service which provides rapid answers to questions texted to 82275 - \"275\" spells \"ask\" on a mobile phone's keypad. Each query costs the texter &pound;1. The questions are fielded by a small army of texperts sitting at internet-connected computers which can be anywhere. When Ben was in Kenya that meant heading to the nearest town and sitting in an internet cafe for a few hours every couple of days.<P>By British standards the pay isn't fantastic. Texperts get about 30p per question answered. Ben reckons he makes between &pound;5 and &pound;9 an hour. Converted into Kenyan shillings, however, the money looks rather better. He didn't have to answer a huge number of questions to support himself.<P>Possibly more of a challenge was the difference in time zone. It's two or three hours later in Kenya than in the UK depending on the season. Kenya doesn't have summer time. And texperts have to be prepared for considerable fluctuations in demand which makes for somewhat unsociable working hours.<P>Peak time is, unsurprisingly, Friday night. It's not just a matter of resolving drunken arguments about which year Manchester United were relegated from the old First Division. (That would be 1974. Even I know that.) There are more prosaic queries about which bus to get home or which pubs are open late. No matter how the global reach of the internet becomes, it still seems extraordinary that a question about bus timetables from a drunken punter in Newcastle is being answered, if only he knew, by somebody in an African internet cafe.<P>Being a fast Googler might be seen as a necessary qualification for texperts, but, in fact the world's most popular search engine can be a little slow compared with more specialist sources or the database of responses to questions that have already been answered. Texperts also have their own particular areas of expertise. So Ben specialises in literature, Africa and sport. The last is a potentially lucrative specialism as can be seen from 82ask's Glasgow based football texpert who has just passed the 100,000 mark for questions answered.<P>\"You get a lot of trivia questions on weekday evenings,\" says Ben. \"I'd hate to think we'd be in some way responsible for the death of the pub quiz.\"<P>There must be an awful lot of quiz-cheaters furtively texting under tables. The growth rate of 82ask has been averaging 28% each month with little spending on advertising. Services are being added such as links to online maps for location-based questions. The company has also received funding to develop its sophisticated back-end systems.<P>Now I'm going to save you three quid in text queries. Robert Earnshaw is the only player to have scored a hat-trick at all levels of English professional football, the FA and League Cups and at full international level. Top Gear's the Stig is usually former ASCAR driver Ben Collins, but sometimes he's a private owner. The old Stig was ex-F1 driver Perry McCarthy.<P>Finally, in less than 160 characters: \"Meaning of life is: a 1983 Monty Python film, in D Adams HH's Guide to the Galaxy 42 or: happiness (ultiliarianism) no fear (Epicurus), no needs (buddhism).\"<P><b>Nick Clayton is a freelance writer and web content consultant</b><P><b>&#183; </b>Have you started a business overseas?

Agendas driven by fear dominate.</p><p>Distrust and divisions between key member states has weakened the ability of the UN to deal effectively with a major crisis like the war in Lebanon last year, or the human rights nightmare now unfolding in the occupied territories, or the tragedy in Darfur, which is spilling into Chad and the Central African Republic. It has unleashed fear and suffering for millions of ordinary people.</p><p>The failure of the international community to resolve conflicts has given space to armed groups to flex their muscles, feeding on people's grievances, promoting divisive, parochial and sectarian interests and using fear, bloodshed and brutality to gain control, as Iraq, Gaza and Sri Lanka show daily.</p><p>Governments and the international community need to urgently address the grievances on which these groups feed, devise effective institutions to hold them to account and be ready themselves to be more accountable. It is only through investment in justice and human rights, the rule of law and accountable institutions that the international community can counteract the fear-mongering strategies of armed groups and repressive regimes.</p><p>Instead, governments around the world are engaging in the politics of fear, eroding the rule of law and creating a downward spiral of abuse, in which no rights are sacrosanct and no person safe.</p><p>Fear is being used to justify a dangerous roll back of the absolute prohibition against torture and ill treatment. The UK government has deported people to countries where they could face torture. The German supreme court has allowed the use of evidence that might have been obtained by torture. The US outsourced torture by transferring suspects for interrogation to countries like Syria and Morocco, and turned a blind eye to torture and ill treatment by CIA agents.</p><p>The US-led program of \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/rendition/0,,1662557,00.html\">extraordinary renditions</a>\" was in effect the globalisation of human rights violations, abducting, and \"disappearing\" suspects from places as far and wide as Italy, Pakistan, Germany and Kenya, and holding them for years in secret detention beyond the reach of the law.</p><p>When the US, European and other western governments use security fears to chip away at human rights, they legitimise the practices of governments like Egypt that have never had any scruples about ignoring human rights in the name of security.</p><p>Fear of national security was always an excuse to repress dissent, but now has been given new life by fears of terrorism. Old \"tools\" like political killings in the Philippines and prosecution of journalists in Turkey are now being complemented with the use of new technology in countries like China, Belarus and Iran to clamp down on internet users.</p><p>Fear of the outsider is a powerful totem for governments who mean to isolate and control their populations. In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe continues to tout the threat of the former colonial power and others in the west to justify his policy of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Murambatsvina\">forced eviction</a> of people from their homes and a crackdown on all who criticise him. In Russia the government talked up fears of mysterious foreign financiers to introduce a tough law on NGOs that was then used to shut down a human rights organisation working in Chechnya. At the same Russia has done little to tackle the alarming rise in hate crimes against foreigners and minorities.</p><p>Fear of being invaded by hordes of poor people has been used successfully in western Europe to whip up support for restrictive policies against refugees, asylum seekers and migrants.</p><p>Fear has led to hostility towards Muslims, Arabs and Asians on the one hand, and to anti-western and anti-American sentiments on the other. Increasing polarisation has strengthened the hand of extremists, reducing the space for tolerance. Islamophobia has been on the rise as has anti-semitism.</p><p>Fortunately, many people have refused to submit blindly to fear-mongering policies. Journalists and human rights activists put \"war on terror\" renditions under scrutiny, which eventually led European institutions to initiate investigations last year. Courts are challenging control orders. Activists have compelled the UN to agree to draft a treaty, which will control the arms trade. Civil society groups are resisting the backlash against minorities and foreigners.</p><p>The alternative to fear is courageous, principled leadership. There is an important \"changing of the guard\" happening in many countries - new premiers in <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3673102.stm\">France</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.gordonbrownforbritain.com/\">UK</a>, a new Congress in the US, a new <a href=\"ttp://www.un.org/sg/\">secretary general</a> at the UN.

But may I reinstate a footnote to the proposal, which is that everyone should have one tax-free voucher for a short-haul flight? I do not think travel - or holidays abroad - should be only for the well-off. I just think we should all fly much less, to reduce CO2 emissions, and that taxing flights is the only way that is going to happen.</p><p>Max Hastings also suggested - following the original article in the Observer - that I had no enthusiasm for ethical travel. That is way off the mark. \"Ethical travel\" is a complex area, and it is hard to weigh up the very real economic benefits of travel, particularly to the developing world, against the impact of carbon emissions from flying. But I am a huge advocate of ethical and green initiatives in the travel industry. Some of them may be skin-deep but others are inspired - and I salute them.<br /><strong>Mark Ellingham</strong><br />Publisher, Rough Guides</p><p>Max Hastings writes a good piece on binge flying and taxation. What he does not convey is that long-haul business and first-class are the fastest-growing, and that the carbon footprints for long-haul business and first class are, respectively, about three and six times bigger than economy (based on cabin area per seat). This should be more widely recognised and a culture encouraged that flying first or business is antisocial behaviour. Taxation should be proportional to the carbon footprint. It should also be understood that, based on air passenger duty figures for flying from the UK, the total footprint from all long-haul flying is over double that of all short-haul.<br /><strong>Stewart Reddaway</strong><br />Baldock, Hertfordshire</p><p>This proposed tax would be ineffective. One in five people who earn over &pound;40,000 are responsible for 70% of aviation emissions. It is essential therefore that taxes are targeted at these rich frequent flyers who can afford it, rather than having a highly regressive tax for all.<br /><strong>Peter Hack<br /></strong> Bristol</p><p>Your piece on the advisory committee on releases to the environment's report (Advisers urge more emphasis on crop experiment benefits, May 4) implied GM crops had been hard done by because they are subject to a rigorous risk assessment before being allowed on the market. This view ignores the massive adverse impacts on the countryside and rural economy of adopting new technologies and management techniques in farming since 1945 without similarly rigorous risk assessments. This is no time to abandon such assessments.</p><p>It would be foolish to trade off farmland wildlife for minor gains in carbon fixing by a novel crop. There is a long way to go before we have a reliable, robust and bias-free way to assess the environmental, social, economic and cultural impacts of new technology and management practices in farming. A narrowly based scientific advisory committee is not the place to take this process forward - the public have equally valid views on the complex issues involved.<br /><strong>Pete Riley</strong><br />Campaign director, GM Freeze</p><p>Desmond Tutu rightly calls on rich countries to stop the pollution causing climate change (This fatal complacency, May 5). From the pastoralists of northern Kenya to the farmers of the deltas of Bangladesh and the Mekong, Oxfam has seen that poor and vulnerable people across the world are being forced to adapt to climate change as their livelihoods are imperilled by worsening drought, floods and erratic rainfall.</p><p>Polluters should not only reduce greenhouse-gas emissions but also act resolutely to provide support to poor countries, enabling them to build their resilience to the worsening blows that climate change will bring in the next 20 years. This change is now inevitable.</p><p>In line with the \"polluter pays\" principle, this compensation must not be paid for by diverting aid; nor should it be used as an excuse to continue polluting.<br /><strong>Phil Bloomer</strong><br />Director of campaigns and policy, Oxfam</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/may/09/theairlineindustry.guardianletters","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/may/09/theairlineindustry.guardianletters","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Google joins the technology push into sub-Saharan Africa","webPublicationDate":"2007-04-04T23:20:58Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2007/apr/05/rwanda.guardianweeklytechnologysection","fields":{"body":"<p>Amid the online buzz about Google's push into Africa at the end of March, few people realised the scope of its plans. Google, which partnered with the governments of Kenya and Rwanda to offer them its Google Apps, is playing a long waiting game on the continent.</p><p>Anyone can download Google Apps for free, but Google has engineers on the ground in the two countries helping the institutions to offer the applications under their own domain names, as it did for millions of university students in Egypt last December. Under these separate deals, its first in sub-Saharan Africa, it will also provide guaranteed service and support to the institutions. In Rwanda, 20,000 users across three universities and some government departments will get to use services like Google's Mail and Calendar.</p><p>This Rwanda is a world away from the Rwanda of 13 years ago. The 1994 civil war razed its infrastructure and decimated its population. Around 1m people were murdered, and twice that many fled the country. The small, land-locked country, in which nine out of 10 people subsist through agriculture, started its long, painful journey into the 21st century with a huge handicap.</p><p>Instead of following the traditional routes of economic development, the Government decided to try and leapfrog large parts of industrialisation altogether and turn itself into an information economy. In 2000, it launched a concerted 20-year umbrella plan to develop its ICT sector as part of a wider Vision 2020 initiative that officials hope will quadruple its GDP.</p><p>Rwanda is training its own people while bringing in outside experts to help on a series of ambitious projects. Eight people from the team responsible for the Malaysian internet super-corridor have been bought in to help with the plan.</p><p><strong>Developing portals</strong></p><p>In its dash to catch up with the West, Rwanda's shopping basket - and wallet - seems bottomless. It relies heavily on funds from the UN and from European countries. For example, the Rwandan IT Authority (RITA) is wholly sponsored by the Swedish government.</p><p>ICT projects seem to litter officials' desks. The Dutch are paying for a fibre optic backbone that will be in place by 2008. Local government portals have been developed, along with a chain of community internet centres. And then there's the national DVB-H network.</p><p>\"We converted the TV and radio networks from analogue to digital and implemented terrestrial internet broadcast services,\" says Peter Fullarton, interim director of RITA. He got the $2m (&pound;1m) for the first phase of the $7m project during an impromptu meeting, when the president signed over the cash to get things moving. \"48 days later, we turned on phase one.\"</p><p>Fullarton also claims to have slashed internet connectivity costs by 70% by using a transponder from Intelsat at wholesale prices, and using state-of-the-art equipment to compress the data. Co-ownership of an Earth station in Sweden gives Rwanda a direct link into the European backbone, he says.</p><p>This means that he can sell internet access to places like Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania for $1,300 per megabit, as opposed to traditional costs of around $4,200. Developments such as these are catalysing the economy; by this summer, a large American company will be piloting outsourced software development in Rwanda.</p><p>During its frenetic rush to catch up, Rwanda ran into the arms of MIT's Nicholas Negroponte and his One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative. President Paul Kagame signed up to OLPC in January and the country is due to take delivery of its first laptops any day now.</p><p>Not everyone is happy about the decision, which Kegame made in conjunction with the ministries of education, and science and technology. Fullarton, charged with fuelling the growth of the Rwandan ICT economy, was not directly involved.</p><p>\"The device is relatively expensive. It's not the $100 laptop that people believe it to be,\" says Fullarton, who also frets that there aren't enough networks in rural Rwanda to support the initiative.</p><p>The idea behind the laptop, each of which will ship with 1GB of Flash memory, is that a wireless mesh network will enable children to share each other's storage, says Negroponte, founder of the project. \"The mesh network is made for a place like Rwanda,\" he says, adding that he has partners working on $10 DVD and hard drives. \"And it was always to cost more than $100 at launch, with the $100 price being approximately two years later.\"</p><p>Still, Fullarton is pushing the development of an indigenous PC vendor, privately-funded Emara. With just 10 employees, the company has small beginnings. It will assemble components shipped to it by Swedish design firm JDL Humantech, which is hoping that its design for a low-powered, developing world-friendly PC will also sell in other places including Latin America.</p><p><strong>African beach head</strong></p><p>\"The typical first customer in most of the countries we're dealing with is the education or public sector,\" says JDL's director of marketing development Johan Holmberg, who expects the computers to retail at $350. Off-the-shelf computers in Rwanda currently cost $1,000-$1,200 thanks to complicated supply chains. He hopes to cut his prices using a low margin, high-value model.</p><p>Holmberg hopes that Rwanda - the first market for the firm's design - might ship 3-4,000 units per year, but wants volume shipments of 200,000 units in 12-18 months through markets like Ethopia, Ghana, and some countries in Asia and Latin America. He claims to be negotiating with partners in 50 countries. In the meantime, Emara is gearing up to sell the assembled PC to neighbouring markets.</p><p>As Rwanda and its partners bustle into the 21st century, Google (also a sponsor of the OLPC initiative) is watching and waiting. Francoise Brougher, global director of strategy and business operations, is eager to see the rollout of last-mile infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa so that it can bring its network-based computing model to the wider public there. She is hoping to roll out Google Apps to many more users in Rwanda and Kenya before the end of the year.</p><p>Google provided the Google Apps services to Rwanda free of charge because it wants to create the demand for more internet services. But use the word \"donation\" and Brougher sounds offended. \"It's an investment,\" she retorts.</p><p>Rwanda and Kenya are the company's beachhead into Africa. Eventually, it wants to be in every country in sub-Saharan Africa, which holds over 10% of the world's population and which will top a billion by 2025.</p><p>\"We have two objectives: the first is to go across all the countries in sub-Saharan Africa,\" says Brougher.</p><p>This raises questions about Google's approach to difficult political regimes. Google's mission is to make information free and universally accessible, yet it has already complied with the Chinese government's censorship requirements.</p><p>\"We are going to have a case-by-case analysis of the situation before we go in,\" says Brougher. \"I will call my colleague in policy.\" Clearly, she has some difficult conversations ahead of her.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to <a href=\"mailto:tech@guardian.co.uk\">tech@guardian.co.uk</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/apr/05/rwanda.guardianweeklytechnologysection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2007/apr/05/rwanda.guardianweeklytechnologysection","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Newly asked questions: Is Google developing an iPhone rival?","webPublicationDate":"2007-03-22T23:52:59Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"guardian/2007/mar/22/guardianweeklytechnologysection.mobilephones","fields":{"body":"<p>Not strictly, and that's even if it is developing a mobile phone.

He doesn't know or care about the translucency of the Aero interface. Nevertheless, the new operating system could indirectly affect him, and people like him.</p><p>Ng'ang'a's farm near Nakuru, a highland city in Kenya's Rift Valley province, is as technologically innovative as most farms in Kenya get. While his western counterparts take advantage of GPS-guided fertilising and crop planning software, he is using older technology from a local weather station to help hone his crops and keep his farm above the poverty line.</p><p>He farms in a country where 80% of the land is dry. Historically, the crop would fail on his land three years out of every four, and his 3,000-strong local rural community, which suffers from a food deficit, has relied on government assistance.</p><p>Eleven years ago, Ng'ang'a, who trained in agriculture at university, decided to try to turn things around using hard numbers. He had been collecting his own weather data for years using tools as simple as a tin can buried in the yard for measuring rainfall, and he has been working with professors at the local Egerton university manually to analyse historical weather patterns and try to predict what was going to happen.</p><p><strong>Donated computers</strong></p><p>Combining temperature and rainfall data with information about the nature of the soil enabled him to plan his crops more effectively. Consequently, he has harvested crops without fail for the past 10 years.</p><p>Now, Kenya's central meteorological department hopes to see weather analysis technologies spring up across the country. High-tech and low-tech met in Nakuru, thanks to computers donated from the west. The Kenyan Meteorological Service has been channeling used computers from the UK to its local weather stations. They come via Computer Aid (<a href=\"http://www.computeraid.org\">computeraid.org</a>), a London-based charity that refurbishes used PCs and sends them to countries in the developing world.</p><p>The Nakuru station has been busy digitising its 62 years of rainfall data. For years, like the 34 other weather stations in Kenya, the station has fed the information through to the central Nairobi office by phone. The data was useful for the central office, which has donated computers to crunch the numbers, but it was largely useless to the local weather station, which didn't have the resources to process its own data for the benefit of its own community. So until recently, the information sat dormant on the shelves.</p><p>One staffer working full-time took a week to enter the numbers, and then the station began processing the data, using past experiences to predict what would happen in the coming year.</p><p>The weather is cyclical, says Simon Gathara, a senior meteorologist at the Kenya Meteorological Department. \"We may look at the data this year and say 'this cycle looks like 1965'.\" This enables the station to advise farmers on the probability of success when planting crops at different times.</p><p>The Nakuru station's modernisation benefits Ng'ang'a, who can combine the data from the Nakuru station and hone it with his own. Whereas processing data on paper allowed him to map out different weather scenarios, doing it on a computer gives him better information, which lets him plant different types of crops that don't rely so heavily on rain.</p><p>\"We are now able to select the best crops for that particular year,\" he says. Not only can he can grow different strains of maize in given months to take the best advantage of the volatile weather, but he can also plant grasses, too. Other potential crops include millet, sorghum (an Ethiopian crop) and cotton.</p><p>Nevertheless, Nakuru is still half an hour's drive away, and that's enough to make him hanker for a computer closer to home. The more local the weather data, the more accurate it is likely to be, but local processing capabilities are limited thanks to a lack of available computers. \"There are many agricultural zones in Kenya,\" says Gathara. \"There are types of soil here that are as hard as rock. So you need many stations close to the farms.\"</p><p><strong>New kit</strong></p><p>What does any of this have to do with Windows Vista? The demanding new operating system calls for the latest machines, and would crawl along on any of the machines that Computer Aid is shipping to Kenya. Mike Cherry, an analyst at specialist market watcher Directions on Microsoft, warns consumers that any PCs more than a year old probably won't run Vista optimally. So as consumers upgrade there could be a lot of relatively new kit floating around.</p><p>You could recycle that equipment, but according to Tim Jenkins, ICT officer at the Powys-based Centre for Alternative Technology, it's more environmentally friendly to reuse it. You could give it to someone else in the house, sell it for peanuts online - or channel it to someone like Ng'ang'a, for whom any sort of processing power could mean the difference between a poor or nonexistent crop and a successful one. That's one calculation that you don't need a computer to do for you.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Danny Bradbury visited Kenya as a guest of Computer Aid</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to <a href=\"mailto:tech@guardian.co.uk\">tech@guardian.co.uk</a></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/mar/22/insideit.guardianweeklytechnologysection","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2007/mar/22/insideit.guardianweeklytechnologysection","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Newsbytes","webPublicationDate":"2007-03-22T00:01:14Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2007/mar/22/guardianweeklytechnologysection1","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Scotland's super</strong></p><p>Edinburgh University's supercomputing centre has unveiled Maxwell, a new &pound;3.6m supercomputer designed and manufactured in Scotland using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).<br /><a href=\"http://www.fhpca.org\">www.fhpca.org</a> </p><p><strong>Googling Africa</strong></p><p>Google has announced separate partnerships with the Rwandan Ministry of Infrastructure and the Kenya Education Network, which will enable students in those countries to use Google Apps under their institutions' domain names free of charge.<br /><a href=\"http://google.com/a\">google.com/a</a></p><p><strong>Sophos will block Second Life</strong></p><p>UK-based Sophos will enable companies to block staff access to the Second Life online world, starting today.

SS denotes a steamship, HMS is for Her Majesty's ship. The full name of the ship was SS Empire Windrush. This has been corrected.<br><br> <hr><P>Three years ago, during an evening celebrating the West Indies' 75th anniversary as a Test-playing team, Viv Richards took to the stage of Birmingham's Symphony Hall to receive an award as one of the Caribbean's top five players of all time.<P>At the crease in the 70s and 80s, Richards always cut a distinctive figure. A merciless batsman, he none the less maintained a nonchalant gait. In between apparently effortless boundaries the \"Master Blaster\" swaggered around the field, chewing gum and refusing to wear a helmet, even against the ferocious pace of the likes of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. But as he addressed the Birmingham audience his easy-going manner gave way to a sterner tone. Collecting his award, he turned to the current West Indies team, which had just lost the first Test to England at Lords by 210 runs, and said: \"You guys have something serious to represent, and don't ever forget that. Because of the inspiration factor of the past, let us hope you guys understand what it is to represent the West Indies. Cricket began a long time ago. Let us not forget why you guys are here, OK?\" Within a month England had crushed them four-nil.<P>There was a time, back in Richards' day, when a West Indies defeat of this magnitude meant something. Like a football World Cup without Brazil, or Wimbledon without at least one of the Williams sisters, West Indies losing at cricket altered the natural order of things. \"Unprecedented is this fact in world sport,\" wrote Tim Hector, the late Antiguan socialist and cricket commentator. \"No other people for so long - a decade and a half - so completely dominated an international sport. Especially when it is understood that this dominance, this excellence, was based on a small, a tiny, a minuscule population of 5 million souls. The smallest cricketing nation in the world.\"<P>But by 1995, when Australia bowled the whole team out for just 51, defeat (sometimes on a humiliating scale) had become commonplace. The next year they lost to Kenya - hardly a cricketing giant. Now, as the West Indies play host to the Cricket World Cup - a cup they were the first to win, in 1975 - they rank eighth of the 11 one-day nations, ahead only of Zimbabwe, Bangladesh (who have overtaken them since the seedings were made) and Kenya.<P>There are probably as many theories explaining this dismal state of affairs as there are inhabitants of some of the smaller islands. The most popular ones include feckless youth, incompetent management, greedy players, inter-island rivalry, cable television and economic decline. But one consensual strand underpins them all. It's not just about cricket. The Caribbean has long contained its own particular blend of European, African and American influences, of which cricket was but one. But with independence, US hegemony and globalisation, the nature of that mix has shifted radically over the past 50 years.<P>Just like the banana and sugar industries that once dominated the islands, cricket has found itself under threat from more powerful influences than it has had to contend with in the past. It was the planters and merchants who carried the game there from England. The cricket season and the crop season changed in lockstep. Just as with bananas and sugar, the question today is not whether it is in decline, but whether that decline is permanent or cyclical. Will it adapt or die? News of its death has been greatly exaggerated, but for the time being the prognosis is poor.<P>Driving into Bridgetown from the airport, banners advertising the World Cup hang from the road lamps proclaiming: \"Cricketing legends are born here.\" Local cricketer Brandon Fross believes the stork that is supposed to deliver such legends is long overdue. \"There's no new talent coming up,\" he says. \"Every year the best players get one year older.\" Fross sits, padded up, by the Barclay ground pavilion, waiting to bat for Wanderers against another local Bajan team, Pickwick.<P>Most here concede no more than the possibility of a West Indies victory in the World Cup. \"I'm a West Indian so I have to love West Indian cricket,\" says Fross. \"But we're a second-division side now. We raised the level of the game and then the others aspired to that level but we didn't maintain it; so relatively speaking, we've fallen.\"<P>Michael Walcott, another Wanderers veteran and son of the late, legendary batsman Clyde Walcott, thinks that \"there's just not enough money invested to maintain interest. The facilities are poor. The grounds are poor. We have games in the domestic competition which are being forfeited because not enough players are showing up. That never used to happen.\"<P>The day before, at the opening of Bridgetown's Kensington Oval, which will host the World Cup final, you would never have guessed the game was in the doldrums. It's a sell-out, and there is a carnival atmosphere. The stadium has been expensively renovated. The World Cup presents a rare chance for the region to showcase itself on the global stage. \"Cricket brings in a lot of revenue in sports tourism,\" says Stephen Wagg, author of Cricket and National Identity in the Postcolonial Age, and a lecturer at Leeds Metropolitan University. \"It's one of the things that gives the islands an identity in the market place.\" But with matches played in nine separate countries, spanning roughly the same distance as that between Edinburgh and Madrid, and only Jamaica having enough hotel rooms to comfortably accommodate everyone, the logistics are causing jitters.<P>The Oval opening is an exercise in nostalgia. Various parts of the stadium are named after the Barbadian cricketing giants: the Garfield Sobers pavilion, the Joel Garner end; the Malcolm Marshall end. The spectators sit in three stands bearing the names of legends: Hall and Griffiths; Worrel, Weekes and Walcott; Greenidge and Haynes. What makes the whole event more poignant is that this great past is so recent in years, and yet so distant in talent. Most of those they are nostalgic for are still alive.<P>Everton Weekes, Seymour Nurse, Charles Griffith, Joel Garner, Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes are each introduced to the crowd and then driven around the stadium in golf buggies. Then comes the big daddy of them all: Garfield Sobers, who brings the stadium to his feet. And as each one circles the pitch they give particularly knowing nods and waves to those they know and recognise: these are both global giants and local heroes.<P>It is then that two things strike you. The first is that, with the exception of Brian Lara, it is difficult to imagine anyone even remembering the names of the players of the past decade, let alone naming things after them. Second, that one of the most amazing things about the decline of West Indian cricket is the heights it reached in the first place. In terms of size and population, most of the islands are little more than big towns with flags and anthems. Barbados has roughly the population of Nottingham, living on land not much bigger than the county of Rutland; but that makes it the fourth largest and most populous of the 13 islands that comprise the team. It is staggering that such a small area should have dominated anything on a global scale.<P>\"Caribbean social scientists are in general agreement on one point at least,\" professor Hillary Beckles, principal of the University of West Indies campus in Barbados, has argued. \"That the excellence achieved in the region's cricket culture, masterfully demonstrated in the two decades that came crashing down in 1995, represents one of the finest expressions of efficient human resources mobilisation since the fulfilment of the national independence agenda.\"<P>\"What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?\" asked the Trinidadian-born intellectual CLR James in his famous treatise on West Indian cricket, Beyond a Boundary. The development of West Indian cricket, say scholars, can be broadly divided into three stages that parallel broader developments in the region. The first was the colonial phase, when the crease was the one place where blacks and whites could interact with some semblance of equality. \"Cricket was a field where the social passions of the colonials, suppressed politically, found vigorous if diluted expression,\" wrote James. If wars were won on the playing fields of Eton, then aspiration for social change was being contested on the playing fields of the Caribbean. \"Cricket and cricket alone provided the medium in popular sports, through which we could take an English institution and transform it, recreate it in our own image and likeness, and stamp our personality on it,\" argued Hector. \"Liberating ourselves from impositions which the heavy weight of centuries had reinforced with the limitation of spirit, vision and self-respect.\"<P>With the end of the second world war came the broader challenge to colonialism and the second, \"nationalist phase\". In 1950, just two years after the symbolic arrival of SS Windrush marked the beginning of substantial post-war migration, the West Indies beat England for the first time. \"Beating England,\" wrote Michael Manley, the late Jamaican president and author of A History of West Indian Cricket, \"was more than a sporting success. It was the proof that a people was coming of age. They had bested the masters at their own game on their own home turf.\"<P>It would be several years before many of the islands would actually gain independence and even longer before West Indies would achieve supremacy in the game. Back home it would also see an attempt to unite the region into a West Indies federation - something like the EU. The efforts would crash on the rocks of petty island rivalries and economic and cultural differences. \"It was only in Britain that we became West Indians,\" the intellectual, Stuart Hall, once told me. \"Growing up I was Jamaican.\"<P>The only area where the region did explicitly come together was cricket. Since it was an area in which it would come to excel, the sport became something of a flagship for the case for regional unity. \"Our politics pales into insignificance against our cricket,\" Hector once claimed. \"Our economies fare even worse. In science and technology we have done little of note. In literature and music alone do we have achievements matching our cricketers.\"<P>And as West Indians moved abroad, the impact of this cricketing success moved with them. I know this from my own upbringing: I was named after Gary Sobers. (My dad wanted to call me Garfield but my mum, thank God, put her foot down.) Cricket formed the social glue that bound the Caribbean community in Stevenage, where I grew up. I was a scorer for the Stevenage West Indian Sports and Social Club. One of my brothers kept wicket. My mum was secretary. Every summer we would travel to small home counties villages and integrate with them one weekend at a time.<P>And during the 70s and early 80s - the years of sus laws and riots when the police used the Notting Hill carnival to test new paramilitary and surveillance equipment - the Test matches between the West Indies and England were not about sport. They were about resistance. In 1976, a particularly violent year at Notting Hill, the South African-born England captain, Tony Greig, promised to make the West Indies \"grovel\". The West Indies won the series 3-0.<P>\"Everything about our life in England at that time told us that we were inferior,\" says the Rev Wilfred Wood, Britain's first black bishop, who recently returned to his native Barbados. \"It's not something that we accepted. But the only thing that publicly expressed our refusal to accept it was cricket. Once we were on the field with them, everyone knew who the masters were.\"<P>But as our generation came of age, the ties that bound our parents no longer held strong. We had football and rugby to choose from and a range of opportunities - including descending into the underclass - that our parents never had. The Stevenage West Indies Sports and Social Club disbanded. Given the fortunes of the West Indian cricket team, we lost interest just in time.<P>The third, and current, phase is characterised by globalisation. The concentration of capital and unbalanced trading system has left many islands fighting for their economic and cultural life. Since the EU announced it was cutting its import sugar price by a third, St Kitts and Nevis has stopped producing sugar entirely; the current harvest in Trinidad will be the last time the government is directly involved in the industry. Barbados is also cutting back.<P>In St Vincent, more than 50% of the workforce is in some way involved in the banana business. The effect of cheaper imports from multi-nationals in Central America is the equivalent to a pit closure in a mining town.<P>So what has all this got to do with cricket? In one sense the same as it has to do with the decline in colliery bands in Britain or jazz in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina: decimate an economic base and the culture it helped produce will soon follow. Young aspirant sports players in the Caribbean are now more likely to be attracted by basketball (which could earn them a scholarship to an American university) or football, which could pay millions.<P>\"Twenty-five years ago, cricket was the only avenue anyone had to be recognised. The West Indian team represented international stardom for any youngster,\" Lara said a few years ago. \"It still does [but now] there are a lot more distractions and more avenues.\"<P>Such economic realities are buttressed by the cultural effect of cable television piping in the latest international sporting superstars plying their trade. Bubba's, a sports bar in the south of Barbados, was packed with young locals in Manchester United shirts watching the US all-star basketball game beamed live from Las Vegas. Earlier that morning, at the Lucky Horseshoe down the road, there was Premiership football. And although it may be 24C outside, that doesn't stop sports enthusiasts watching ice hockey, if that's what's on.<P>I can see the changes in my own family. My Uncle Michael is still a cricket coach at primary school level there. He says the enthusiasm remains, but the infrastructure to mould it is decaying. Meanwhile two of my cousins play basketball and another is a regional squash champion. They'll watch cricket, but they neither follow it nor play it. \"When you let people know how much Shaq gets for basketball,\" says Michael, \"and how much Beckham gets to go to the US, it's not that surprising that cricket struggles to compete.\"<P>\"I think we are too influenced by American culture,\" argues Walcott. \"Everything now has to be quick and fast. Cricket is a slow game.\"<P>\"It's not a game any more, it's a business,\" says Fross. With money now such a big factor, players are far more assertive. Whereas, in the past, prominent individual players contributed to a team character, today the focus is on personalities and personal success. In 1998 the team staged a strike and refused to travel to a newly democratic South Africa until they got a pay raise. Their actions compared unfavourably with Richards' refusal to break the boycott and play under apartheid, despite being offered $1m.<P>And there is one individual above all who stokes controversy: Lara. \"When Lara finishes batting I turn off the TV,\" says Fross. \"He's entertaining. I would get up at 2am to watch him, but not for anyone else.\" And Lara, it is fair to say, has a clear idea of his own value. Last year he threatened to resign as captain because the poor management of the team was ruining his personal brand. \"It's painful what has gone on in the last couple of months,\" he said after a Test defeat by India. \"I have West Indies cricket at heart, but if it's a situation where my reputation as a captain is being dragged down . . .\"<P>None of this is inevitable. By definition, the West Indies isn't the only region grappling with globalisation. With civil wars, wars on terror, military rule, or postponed elections, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka all have problems of their own, yet their cricket structure remains unharmed. True, the geographical proximity to the US has a bearing on the Caribbean, but the islands are no mere receptacle of American and European influences either. If the banana industries of St Lucia and Dominica have been revived thanks to Fairtrade bananas, then the West Indian cricketing culture could, with effort, restore itself to the heart of the region's identity.<P>\"Cricket is the only sport here that appeals to everyone,\" says Dorian Bryan, executive news editor of the Barbados Advocate. \"It's the only sport we play as a group. It has a significance collectively. Cricket goes further than just winning.\" For the islands' sake, let's hope he's right."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/13/garyyounge.features11","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2007/mar/13/garyyounge.features11","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Interview: Calestous Juma","webPublicationDate":"2007-03-06T14:24:00Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2007/mar/06/academicexperts.highereducationprofile","fields":{"body":"<p>The place is Stockholm in the late 1970s. In the half-light of the Arctic winter, two figures are scurrying down the snow-clad roads, disappearing every so often into doorways. Their appearance sets them apart from the tightly swaddled, pale-faced Swedish natives. One is a Mexican journalist, in town to cover a conference on a new academic fancy called climate change. The other is Calestous Juma. They are on the hunt for warm coats.</p><p>\"It was my first time abroad,\" the Kenyan-born academic says, smiling at the naivety of his mid-20s self. \"I had no concept of cold. So I went shopping with a fellow journalist, doing tactical stopovers in restaurants to keep warm.\" Today Juma is no stranger to travelling, nor to cold. He is now a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his day job as professor of international development at Harvard University sees him jet-setting around the world, giving speeches to the great and good.</p><p>We meet in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on the eve of his address to the eighth African Union heads of state summit last month. His speciality - science and technology for development - was one of the themes of the meeting. \"Five years ago, I wouldn't have expected it to be the topic of a summit,\" he says. So much has changed, and Juma has been instrumental in changing it.</p><p>The meeting won't necessarily agree large funding increases for science, he says. Nevertheless it gives \"clarity and focus on science and technology for development\". He reminds presidents that it's not new science that will help Africa. The trick is harnessing existing knowledge to catch up with industrialised nations.</p><p>Few would have predicted this illustrious future for the young boy who used to play on the shores of Lake Victoria. The son of a carpenter, his prospects for higher learning were slight. His childhood was blighted by bouts of malaria. But he was bright, and eager to learn. As a youngster, Juma burned for all things technical. In his hometown of Port Victoria, he witnessed the introduction of technologies that improved the life of his people. His father pioneered the introduction of cassava in his country - a willingness to embrace the new clearly passed on to his son.</p><p>In those days, anything would wash up on the beach near their home: old cars, or loudspeakers, which 12-year-old Juma made a profitable business out of fixing up on weekends. This helped him to meet his school fees. \"I had a job first, then retired into school,\" he says.</p><p><strong>Writing talent</strong></p><p>When secondary school proved too expensive, he chose to train as a science teacher. But while pursuing his chosen career, a string of letters to national newspapers singled him out as a writing talent. Soon he was working at the Daily Nation newspaper as science and environment reporter. Journalism worked as a springboard for the young Kenyan. He moved to Environment Liaison Centre International, an environmental organisation based in Nairobi, where he founded and edited its magazine, Ecoforum. This job put him in the way of some deep pockets, and he received a scholarship from the Canadian International Development Research Centre to enter postgraduate studies.</p><p>But no Kenyan institution would accept him without a first degree. So in 1982 he packed his bags and departed for Sussex University, where the science policy research unit offered him a place on a masters degree course. A PhD followed, and then he went back home.</p><p>\"When I finished my studies I went back to Africa and built an institution.\" He says it just like that, but the African Centre for Technology Studies (Acts), founded in 1988, was the first organisation of its kind on the continent. At this time, Juma's focus was on raising the profile of science in policymaking. Pushing it as a tool for development came later.</p><p>In 1995, he left Kenya once more to join the UN as secretary of its convention on biological diversity. He joined at a prodigious time: the millennium development goals were just taking shape. He had a hand in pushing science on to the MDG agenda, and later wrote a report for the UN on harnessing technology for development, published in 2005.</p><p>By then he was already at Harvard. Life at the UN, while stimulating, had become strenuous - the travel duties clashing with his responsibilities as father to Eric, born in 1998. A grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, which at the time was run by Gordon Conway, the current chief scientist in the Department for International Development (DfID), allowed him a welcome break.</p><p>\"I was looking for a fellowship in a quiet place to do some reflection. I had no intention of merging into academia,\" he says. This intention lasted about a year. \"What it did was to give me enormous space for intellectual exploration.\" During that time, he established two academic journals and reconnected to the world of research. But Harvard was an ideal platform from which to build on his work promoting science for development. \"It's a professional school, and it has a connection with the practical world.\" Slowly he was pulled back into the world of international policymaking.</p><p>Today, governments and international organisations consult him on a variety of issues. He deals with the US government on a daily basis. \"We have a very fruitful working relationship. Technology and development is a small sector of the department of state, but they have maintained a focus despite the issues happening globally.\"</p><p>Those \"issues\" are, of course, the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on America in 2001. Juma spent 9/11 and the week that followed grounded in Italy with Fidel Castro - not the dictator, but his son, with whom he had corresponded for years on biotechnology without guessing his descent. \"I didn't think he was the son, since Fidel Castro must be a common name in Cuba. But then I met him at this scientific meeting, and he looked just like his father!\"</p><p>He is also well plugged into the UK government, and credits it with helping to put science on the development agenda. \"Tony Blair has played a very important role. Also, two chief scientists, Bob May and David King, really focused on the development issue,\" he says. Last summer, he was elected to the Royal Society, adding it to memberships with its US counterpart and the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World in Trieste, Italy. Last year, he was awarded the Kenyan honour of Elder of the Order of the Burning Spear, an analogue of the British OBE.</p><p>To relax, he plays soccer with a ragtag group consisting mainly of journalists - in particular, BBC foreign correspondents. They play each other and don't keep score. \"Most of them have jobs that involve yelling at each other,\" he says. The friendly games are an antidote to that professional antagonism.</p><p><strong>The laptop you can't buy</strong></p><p>The interview takes an intriguing turn when he pops something white and green out of his bag. It looks like a toy laptop. In fact, it is the fabled $100 laptop created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to be distributed among the poorest children of the world. It can't be bought, only ordered by governments. Nigeria, Libya and Rwanda have placed orders, and production starts very soon. Juma is on the board developing the software.</p><p>Juma often gets asked when he will return to Africa. It's a barbed question, coming from a continent bedevilled by brain drain. But he views it differently. Nobody accused him of leaving Africa when he was at the UN, but it was then he felt he'd left Africa behind. \"That was when I was disengaged.\" In his current position, he feels engaged once more. He goes back to Kenya at least once a year, and co-chairs a panel drawing up a continental biotechnology strategy, among other things. But he won't go back to live there any time soon. His wife was born and bred in Boston and his family is settled. \"The only reason I'd like to go back is to be involved professionally in Africa.\"</p><p>In the future, he wants to look at the role of higher education reform in development. He also has a project coming up with Japan on biodiversity conservation. And he wants to travel less. Videoconference technology was invented for a reason, he says.</p><p>So far, Africa has hardly lost out from having one of its sons walking the hallowed halls of Harvard. At a gathering in Kenya of the country's ambassadors, somebody asked Juma when he was returning home. Before he could answer, another diplomat interjected softly, \"I think Calestous is better placed for us where he is.\" Wise words about a wise man.</p><p><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 53</p><p><strong>Job:</strong> Professor of the practice of international development and director of the science, technology and globalisation project at Harvard University's Kennedy school of government; adviser to the UN and governments, including those of the US and Britain, on science, technology and development</p><p><strong>Likes:</strong> football, collecting frivolous facts such as the history of the zipper </p><p><strong>Dislikes:</strong> mashed potatoes and neckties</p><p><strong>Married</strong> with a nine-year-old son</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/mar/06/academicexperts.highereducationprofile","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2007/mar/06/academicexperts.highereducationprofile","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Blair's speech on the arts in full","webPublicationDate":"2007-03-06T12:18:33Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2007/mar/06/politicsandthearts.uk1","fields":{"body":"<i>Tony Blair spoke today at Tate Modern in London.</i><P><i>This is the intended text and may differ from the speech as delivered.</i><P>Years ago, before coming to government, I said that we would make the arts and culture part of our \"core script\". In other words, it was no longer to be on the periphery, an add-on, a valued bit of fun when the serious work of government was done; but rather it was to be central, an essential part of the narrative about the character of a new, different, changed Britain.<P>When I said this all those years back, I think there was a certain amount of scepticism. But at last week's Downing Street seminar in advance of this speech, one participant said we would look back on the last 10 years as a \"golden age\" for the arts. I will come on to why that has happened in a moment.<P>But the important point to realise is why I said it. I didn't say it because I thought we, as a government, were of great importance to you, the arts, but rather because you, the arts, were going to be of fundamental importance to the country.<P>The reason for this will be spelt out in the policy reviews shortly to be published across government and is utterly critical to understanding why arts and culture matter to a modern nation like Britain.<P>My argument is this. A country like Britain today survives and prospers by the talent and ability of its people. Human capital is key. The more it is developed, the better we are. Modern goods and services require high value added input. Some of it comes from technology or financial capital - both instantly transferable. Much of it comes from people - their ability to innovate, to think anew, to be creative. <P>Such people are broad-minded: they thrive on curiosity about the next idea; they welcome the challenge of an open world. Such breadth of mind is enormously enhanced by interaction with art and culture.<P>The whole process of stimulation through plays, books, films, works of art; the delight in design, in architecture, in crafts: all of this enlarges a country's capacity to be reflective, interested and bold. Dynamism in arts and culture creates dynamism in a nation.<P>So when more children get access to the joy of art, it is not the art alone that they learn; it is the art of living, thinking and creating. They may never be, probably won't ever be, an artist or a dancer or a designer, but in whatever job, in whichever walk of life, they will carry an idea that is not just about the buying and selling, but about what makes the ordinary, special. When people on low incomes can visit museums free of charge, and see great works of art, they take something of the inspiration with them. A nation that cares about art will not just be a better nation. In the early 21st Century it will be a more successful one.<P>And a more cohesive one. Because art, more than any programmes of government, worthy and necessary though those are, can make people consider, see things differently, understand where the other comes from.<P>So these last 10 years in the arts have been an important part of what Britain has become. And it is a story that should be more often told. <P>It is worth a brief counter-factual exercise. Imagine what the world would have been like if we had continued with the funding regime and the policies that we inherited. Many of the country's finest regional theatres would have closed or would exist as shadows of themselves, on a diet of light drama. Many orchestras would have gone to the wall. There would be no new programmes for art education. Museums, far from being full, would have gradually diminished in importance as charging reduced the audience to the middle class. I'm not sure there would be a British film industry, or at least not one nearly so healthy, or the same huge success at the National Theatre. <P>Instead government funding has doubled since 1997 and is now done on a more stable 3-year basis. Free admission has meant that there are 42 million visits each year to museums and galleries.<P>London has become the creative capital of the world. There have been times when that accolade would have gone to Paris, to Berlin or to New York. Now it belongs here. <P>We have come a very long way. But I am acutely conscious that in this area, more so even than any other, this is not the government's achievement. Indeed, I am here today more to say thank you to you than to advertise the success of government. To the architects that have transformed the scenes of our cities, the dancers, the actors and directors, the artists, the musicians, the curators, the custodians of heritage, I say thank you for your creativity. <P>Culture spans so many disciplines. Almost all of them have asked if they can be specifically mentioned in the speech. To do so, even in list form, would take up most of the time available. So let me say instead that I am very much aware of the contribution from every quarter. There is not a sector represented here which has not contributed to the renaissance of British culture. <P>So it is your achievement. But, by the same token, I don't think you could have done it, or at least not so easily without a change in government policy. I don't by that mean to claim unwarranted credit. I mean that we have developed a particular model of government working with the cultural sector that is both immensely successful and distinctively British. <P>That model is a mixed economy. It combines public funding with private enterprise, subsidy and the box office together. It is characterised by partnerships between the creative sectors and private sponsors. Critically, the Arts Council operates as an arm's-length body so the state is placed in the position of doing what it has historically done well - funding - and not what it has historically done very badly - control of the arts. <P>The native genius of this model is that public subsidy permits risk-taking. A new breed of entrepreneurial leaders in the arts world has shown that art of the highest quality is compatible with sound financial discipline. Indeed, the public subsidy produces a return. <P>The success of Alan Bennett's The History Boys is a good example. Its journey on an international tour and into the West End was all based on its time at the National Theatre, but not funded by it. It has brought earnings of &#163;1 million back to the National Theatre to be invested back in the programme. <P>Manchester International Festival is another example. Manchester City Council invests &#163;2 million. This brings in train Arts Council funding of &#163;0.9 million. This funding is then more than matched by &#163;2.7 million of private sponsorship and a return of &#163;2.3 million at the box office. <P>There are viable alternative models to ours. The dominant European view is that high art can only be protected by insulation from market pressure. Whether or not cultural products pass their appeal to the public is not especially relevant. The role of the state is to carve out a space for culture and ensure it does not have very porous boundaries. <P>At the other end of the spectrum, the Americans see no need for a cultural ministry at all. Nor do they see any great value in public subsidy of the arts. Culture is an essentially private activity. For the state to intervene would be thought of as too much control. <P>There is something to be said for both approaches. They embody two important conceptions of culture - that it should be of the highest quality, on the one hand, and that it should reach as many people as possible on the other. <P>Ever since Matthew Arnold this distinction has been central to arguments about culture. Culture, it was said, could either be excellent or popular but not both. It could be high - meaning good - or low - meaning bad. <P>The post-war history of arts policy in this country tended to reproduce these distinctions. In its early years, the Arts Council operated as if the elite art forms needed to be preserved against encroaching popular idioms.<P>Jennie Lee, as Arts Minister, did start to change this but a lot of her good work was undone as, during the 1980s, some art forms became unaffordable for all but the rich. Community arts projects were scaled back. The critical balance - box office and subsidy - was upset. The funding squeeze persisted through the early 1990s and cemented the spurious distinction between excellence on the one hand and broad access on the other. <P>The great virtue of what we have managed to achieve in this country is that we have clearly got the best of both. We have deepened our culture, extended its reach, with at the same time no compromise on quality, indeed rather the opposite. <P>We have been able to run very effective policies to keep ticket prices down. In the case of national museums, of course, entry is free. That ensures we get as broad an audience as possible without compromising the integrity of the work itself. <P>And the British people have responded by showing they have an enormous appetite for their culture and their history. As Philip Larkin wrote there will always be someone surprising a hunger in themselves to be more serious. <P>You can see this in the overwhelming response to the History Matters campaign that a consortium of heritage bodies ran between July and November of last year. <P>The DCMS will publish figures tomorrow that show box office numbers in the seven major regional theatres have risen by nearly 40% on five years ago. At the same time the RSC sold more than half a million tickets for its shows in London and Stratford-upon-Avon; and visits to national museums have risen by almost 30 million. <P>Between 2002/03 and 2004/05 the number of people from lower socio-economic groups visiting government-sponsored museums increased by almost 30%. The Renaissance in the Regions programme has helped attract almost three quarters of a million new visitors from communities that would not traditionally attend a museum. <P>36 Creative Partnerships linking art and schools, are operating in some of the most deprived wards in the country. An independent survey found that 90% of head teachers thought it improved the confidence of pupils. <P>The imaginative use of technology has also brought access to within reach of very many more people. \nThe UK leads the world in the take-up of digital TV. Internet access is now available for everyone through public libraries by virtue of the government-funded People's Network. Between 2000 and 2003 it connected 4,200 public libraries to the internet, most of them via broadband. And &#163;120 million of National Lottery funding provided over 24,000 terminals, training for library staff and funding for the digitisation of learning materials. <P>And the cultural treasures that can now be found on-line are remarkable. A decade ago the British Library put the Magna Carta on-line. Its award-winning Turning The Pages system recently brought a dozen of the Library's most iconic works to the web. <P>The beauty of the last decade is that we have not put \"bums on seats\" at the expense of quality. <P>The creative industries now account for more than 7% of the economy. They are growing at 5% per annum, faster than the economy as a whole. They employ almost 2 million people.<P>Exports from the arts sector contributed &#163;13 billion to the balance of trade in 2004, equivalent to 4.3% of goods and services exported. <P>The music industry contributes &#163;6 billion to the economy and employs 130,000 people. London is one of three global capitals for the advertising industry; a top exporter of design; the second largest publishing centre in Europe; we have a broadcasting industry of world renown, again on the model of the mixed economy. <P>This economic boon is not dry and arithmetical. It is visible in the people who come to this country as tourists and the reviving of the towns and cities we live in. <P>The tourist benefit shows the British model in action. Seven of the ten most popular tourist attractions in this country are government-sponsored museums and galleries. 28% of visitors to the London theatre come from overseas. <P>Cultural regeneration has created 11,000 jobs in Salford Quays, 6,500 attributable to the Lowry alone. This building we are in created 3,000 jobs in Southwark and an economic benefit of &#163;100 million in its first year. The Baltic and Sage cultural centres have underpinned a &#163;1 billion redevelopment programme for east Gateshead. <P>Bristol Harbourside, the Birmingham jewellery quarter and the Ancoats area of Manchester have all been regenerated by a newly thriving cultural life. This again shows the important interaction of public and private finance. The Birmingham jewellery quarter project, for example, had a total scheme value of &#163;1 million, of which a fifth came from the Conservation Area Partnership and the rest from the private sector.<P>It is not just the physical infrastructure of the cities that have changed for the better. Culture has an intellectual power as well as economic power. We have recently had a debate about the content and the future of the idea of multiculturalism. <P>Culture in a globalised world is an important form of diplomacy. The way we present ourselves to the outside world is increasingly not confined to official diplomatic channels. Technology has changed this. When 1m people a day look at the Tate website, many of them from abroad, we are conducting diplomacy in a new way, almost inadvertently. <P>Increasing numbers of British arts organisations and artists now tour internationally. The British Museum's exhibition in Tehran provided an opportunity for the Foreign Secretary to visit at a sensitive time. The Arts Council's international fellowship programme and its Artists Link Programme with the British Council in China have created some great international exchanges. The British Museum and the V&A have also announced an unprecedented programme of collaboration with China. Exhibitions from the British Museum have also been helping build civil society in Kenya and Ethiopia. <P>All of these areas - regeneration of places, identity politics, cohesion - are areas that government generally finds difficult. The cultural industries, almost incidentally, achieve many of our objectives for us. <P>So, it is clear that we have come a long way. And I know that, though many of you share that analysis, you are also, many of you, nervous that the golden era may be about to end. I understand the concerns over the comprehensive spending review and the claim on resources made by the Olympics. <P>In so far as I can, in advance of decisions yet to be made, let me lay them to rest.<P>First, we need to remember that the Cultural Olympiad offers a fabulous opportunity. We have on the horizon a four-year festival at which we can exhibit a modern, outward-facing Britain. The Olympic victory was a vindication of the cultural face we now present to the world. One of the main reasons we won is that we projected an idea of what Britain is now and what we will become in the future.<P>In respect of both the Olympics and the CSR, there is a process in place to come to decisions. For obvious reasons the conclusions can't be announced now. But I can say this: all of us in government take great pride in what has been achieved this past decade. We have avoided boom and bust in the economy. We don't intend to resume it in arts and culture. <P>Indeed there is a lot more we can do. The Creative Economy Programme will be the first comprehensive assessment of the state of the UK's creative economy. We will produce a Green Paper in the summer of 2007 that will seek to increase the productivity of the sector further. <P>We have articulated a very clear role for government. A mix of funding, arms-length administration and an intelligent framework of regulation. <P>I think the results have been spectacular. When you are searching to show how things have changed you are usually seeking a policy that somehow embodies it. Perhaps it is free entry to museums. But actually the crucial thing is not the policy but the fact that, as Nick Serota said to me recently, museums now just \"feel\" different. They have a different atmosphere. <P>That seems to me to be true of the culture of the country too. It just feels different - more confident, more assertive, more creative and alive. <P>This is an enormous achievement. One that we have done together. It serves our country well; will serve it further in the future. It is something we will and must cherish."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/mar/06/politicsandthearts.uk1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2007/mar/06/politicsandthearts.uk1","sectionName":"Politics"},{"webTitle":"Review: Dreaming of Jupiter by Ted Simon","webPublicationDate":"2007-03-04T02:19:13Z","sectionId":"culture","id":"books/2007/mar/04/travel.features","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Dreaming of Jupiter</strong><br />by Ted Simon</p><p>Little, Brown &#163;18.99, pp448</p><p>'Every separation gives a foretaste of death - and every reunion a foretaste of resurrection.' I'm pretty sure that Schopenhauer never rode a motorcycle, but those sentiments could easily be applied to Ted Simon and his epic revisiting of a round-the-world journey he did in 1973.</p><p>Then, a 42-year-old nascent biker, he set off on a grey British day on an old Triumph with a flying jacket and a hunger for adventure. Four years, 64,000 miles and 45 countries later, he returned, wrote the classic Jupiter's Travels and became an exalted poster boy for the restless and armchair Don Quixotes everywhere.</p><p>Simon's life since has been framed by that journey. So there is almost an inevitability that, in his late sixties, we find him once more getting astride a motorbike - this time a huge, comfortable BMW - and heading off into the unknown: 'To see if I could recapture, in some way, the person I was then - this man who became for some an almost mythical figure. There are thousands who dream of doing what Jupiter did. Why shouldn't I?'</p><p>We follow him through Europe and into north Africa, retracing his original route. Along the way, he looks for the characters who'd been cast in his first trip; the need for reunions seems great. Unsurprisingly, he finds them either gone or, more often, dead. Sometimes, he finds a link to them, only to learn of lives blighted by misfortune and dreams unfulfilled.</p><p>Simon's second journey is, unlike his first, affected by technology. Now obliged to meet up with a film crew and equipped with a mobile phone and a laptop, his weekly duties involve filing for his website, writing a newspaper column and responding to emails from fans offering accommodation. 'It was a shock to realise how much I had changed. I had become a creature of communication,' he writes. 'Where was that man, that \"Jupiter\", who once sat contentedly under a tree by the roadside in India, confident that somehow, someone would bring help and usher in a new adventure?'</p><p>In this regard, the anonymity and serendipity integral to Jupiter's Travels have been destroyed by the very act of its existence and its celebrity, something Simon readily acknowledges. At one stage, he rages with himself for staying in a smart hotel when his younger self would have just 'slung a hammock under a tree'.</p><p>Attempting to find more spontaneous connections, he encounters an ambivalence and a suspicion of strangers that he cannot recall was there in the Seventies. In Sudan, at a roadside teahouse, he notices how the local people stare aggressively at him, 'whereas 27 years earlier, they would have respected me and stared at the bike ... and [back then], as a foreign traveller, I was never able to pay for my tea, but this time there was no such automatic generosity. In these very mundane ways, we are all becoming more alike.'</p><p>In Kenya, the isolation and constant battering his ageing body is taking start to bite and it's clear that the cherished memories of a quarter of a century ago are being slowly, irrevocably, violated. Exhausted and in the middle of a vast plain, he hits a patch of mud and his bike topples over. 'For the first time in my life, I hear the loud snap of a bone breaking,' he writes. 'I put my right foot down, only to see it flop over uselessly.'</p><p>But the disaster proves a godsend for his jaded soul; a brief reunion with 'Jupiter'. Picked up by a passing motorist, he is taken to a nearby hospital, patched up, then, before being transferred to Nairobi, he spends the night with members of the Kikuyu tribe at their homestead, feasting on a goat killed in his honour. 'These are the serendipities you don't forget,' he says, somewhat restored. 'In Africa, things always seemed to work out.'</p><p>On to the Cape, then a flight to Rio. In the first book, South America was where the dashing adventurer had lived out his playboy fantasies. But now he was back, wearing the cloak of invisibility of the old. 'A man of 70 is never going to be looked at in the same light as a man of 43,' he says, ruefully. 'I was all too aware of my fading powers.'</p><p>Then there are all the observations of the then and the now viewed from the saddle: there's the fallout from 9/11 and the start of the Bush foreign adventure, the denuded landscapes where once forests stood, the epidemic rise of gambling, the ubiquity of advertising, the small towns that have burgeoned into vast, ugly urban sprawls, the homogeneity of the architecture, the decline of the railways and the voracious road building. The spirit of Don Quixote lingers in Simon, but the blows come thick and fast.</p><p>'I regret that my son will never be able to dance with the Turkana as I once did, and that China has lost its mystery, that it is possible to travel from one end of Africa to the other without seeing a wild animal that isn't protected, and that the empty beaches I once loved are full,' he writes towards the end. 'I regret that one culture has become so powerful that it has made all the others slaves or tributaries to it, even though it is my culture.' The fact that all this has happened in a quarter of a century makes it more shocking.</p><p>If the book's conclusions are depressing, the writing is anything but. It is, at times, sparse, at others gloriously luminescent, but always self-deprecating. Simon's physical powers are diminishing, but his writing just gets better. The wonderful portraits of the people he encounters, often redolent of Bruce Chatwin, are sometimes so enticing that, were this a movie, you'd swear they were a plant for later on. But we never see or hear from most of them again and this, I suppose, is the essence of the journey.</p><p>The cover of the original book featured a self-portrait of Ted Simon, tanned, straddling his Triumph in some desert somewhere, handsome in his flying jacket, with the world at his feet. The bike, the man and the adventure are utterly indivisible. It is an image that inspired countless others, including me, to follow in his tracks. That image occupies the back of Dreaming of Jupiter. On the cover, the BMW is riderless and a photo of the septuagenarian Ted Simon - the man who dreamt of doing what Jupiter did - floats above, removed, like an apparition.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/04/travel.features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2007/mar/04/travel.features","sectionName":"Culture"},{"webTitle":"3GSM diary: Vodafone and Google","webPublicationDate":"2007-02-12T20:18:13Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/blog/2007/feb/12/3gsmdiaryvoda","fields":{"body":"<p><em>Guardian communications editor Richard Wray is in Barcelona this week for 3GSM - the mobile industry's annual get-together.

Unilever was also hit by a negative note from Credit Suisse, which cut its rating from neutral to underperform, with a &#163;13 target price. \"The shares have gone beyond what we regard as a reasonable reflection of the turnaround possibilities,\" said Credit Suisse.\n</p><p>\nAs for LogicaCMG, the computer services company fell 9.25p to 173.5p after it said its margins had increased in 2006, but its overall growth rate disappointed the market. Credit Suisse reduced its target price from 200p to 190p while Citigroup was again fairly ratty: \"After management's upbeat presentation in December, we are surprised the business appears to have slowed in the second half of 2006.\"\n</p><p>\n\"The market is stuck in a bit of a rut at the moment and any negative news does not get taken well,\" said one trader.\n</p><p>\nNewsagent and bookselling group WH Smith was an exception. It added 21p to 395p despite saying like for like sales at its high street business fell 9% in the 20 weeks to January 20. Total like-for-like sales fell 6%. However, it said margins had improved, and this was enough to save the shares.\n</p><p>\nElsewhere sterling hit a 14-year high against a weakening dollar ahead of tomorrow's key Bank of England minutes - relating to this month's meeting when rates were unexpectedly raised - while oil prices, gold and nickel all moved higher. The firmer metals prices lifted <strong>BHP Billiton </strong>22p to 939p and <strong>Rio Tinto </strong>85p to &#163;26.60.\n</p><p>\nSo, after being in the red for most of the day, by the close the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>was 9.2 points higher at 6227.6. However the <strong>FTSE 250 </strong>index of middle-ranking companies failed to recover, falling 64.4 points to 11,102.2.\n</p><p>\nThere was a late burst of excitement in gas giant <strong>BG, </strong>up 11p to 662.5p on rumours of a possible bid from <strong>BP</strong>, up 4p to 545p. Some traders said BP's Lord Browne might see such a takeover as a fitting legacy before his imminent departure, having apparently failed last year in an attempt to effect a merger with Shell. There were a few hefty trades going through for BG towards the end of the day, but most dealers were cautious on the tale.\n</p><p>\nBut <strong>Dana Petroleum </strong>lost 21p to &#163;10.67 after reporting that the Pomboo-1 exploration well off Kenya - where it has a 30% stake - was found to be dry and would be plugged. Oriel Securites put out a reduce recommendation on the company, saying: \"The shares are trading at a significant premium to our core net asset value and, on this basis, look expensive relative to the sector. The disappointing Pomboo drilling result will dent the potential upside the market sees in Dana and may lead to a re-evaluation of the value of other international prospects.\"\n</p><p>\nGoing the other way was <strong>Cairn Energy. </strong>Its shares have been under the cosh recently following the flotation of its Indian operations, but today they added 19p to &#163;17.02 on reports it had won, in partnership with India's ONGC, two blocks in an auction of assets in the country's gas-rich offshore exploration areas.\n</p><p>\nBuilders merchant and plumbing group <strong>Wolseley </strong>recovered some ground after the negative response to yesterday's trading statement. It added 10p to &#163;13.59 as Credit Suisse issued an outperform rating and &#163;15.20 price target. \n</p><p>\nMeanwhile <strong>Smith &amp; Nephew, </strong>the maker of hip and knee implants recently tipped as a bid target for the private equity owners of rival Biomet, rose 13.5p to 566.75p. Goldman Sachs raised its 12 month target from 470p to 580p, saying the company was likely to cut costs or return up to $1.2bn (&#163;605m) to shareholders to pre-empt being taken over.\n</p><p>\nHousebuilder <strong>Wilson Bowden </strong>added 43p to &#163;23.20 awaiting bid news after the expiry of an initial deadline. Dealers were talking of offers around &#163;25 a share.\n</p><p>\nThe Competition Commission report into supermarkets was widely seen to be benign, and accordingly lifted shares in the sector. <strong>Sainsbury's </strong>added 3.5p to 438p, while <strong>Tesco </strong>was 1.5p better at 415.25p.\n</p><p>\nStruggling record and book retailer <strong>HMV </strong>was steady at 134p on news that US investor Brandes now holds a 10.15% stake.\n</p><p>\nMid-cap insurers were unwanted after Credit Suisse turned negative. <strong>Hiscox </strong>lost 17.75p to 247.75p as the bank cut its target price from 290p to 205p, while <strong>Amlin </strong>fell 19.25p to 304p as it downgraded from outperform to neutral.\n</p><p>\nAnother loser was online gaming group <strong>PartyGaming, </strong>down another 1p to 26.75p on continuing worries about the scope of US investigations into internet gambling. Rival <strong>888 </strong>Holdings fell 10.25p to 105.75p.\n</p><p>\nLower down the market <strong>Beowulf Mining </strong>was steady at 3.375p as it confirmed a new licence application in Sweden for a copper, gold and uranium prospect. \n</p><p>\nTroubled software firm <strong>iSoft </strong>added 5.5p to 55p on reports that three bidders had reached the final stages of the takeover process. The three were said to be US healthcare firms McKesson and Cerner, and US private equity group General Atlantic. Other sources suggested the three might be partners in any bid, rather than rivals.\n</p><p>\nMeanwhile <strong>ClinPhone, </strong>which supplies technology to the clinical trials industry, lost 20p to 177p. In a trading update ahead of an analysts and investors visit to its Nottingham operations, it warned that the weak dollar would hit profitability, as would the fact it is recruiting a large number of new staff, who will need to be fully trained.\n</p><p>\n<strong>2 Way Traffic </strong>was 4.5p better at 144.5p. The company recently bought the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? television format and today it announced licensing deals to produce episodes in China, the US, Slovenia and Slovakia.\n</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/23/marketforces","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2007/jan/23/marketforces","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Shola Adenekan on the universities offering free coursework online","webPublicationDate":"2007-01-17T12:43:05Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2007/jan/17/highereducation.uk","fields":{"body":"<p>In Nigeria, Kunle Adejumo, an engineering student at Ahmadu Bello University, is using print and video materials downloaded from an American university to prepare for an exam in metallurgical engineering.</p><p>Thousands of miles away in France, Brigitte Bouissou, a teacher at an elementary school, is logging on to an internet video lecture being conducted by a professor of mathematics to prepare for the next day's lessons.</p><p>In New York, a sixth-grader is in contact with a fourth-grader in Kenya - they are discussing the migration of wildebeest, both using handheld computers.</p><p>Here in England, James Heywood, a 29-year-old web researcher, is solving his friend's computer security problems with knowledge gained from an online internet course run by a British university.</p><p>Welcome to the world of Open Courseware (OCW), where some of the best universities in the world are offering teaching, learning and research resources to education-hungry people across the globe. And the fees? Zero.</p><p>The OCW phenomenon began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1999 by a faculty committee charged with looking at how the internet would change education and the role MIT would play.</p><p>The committee considered how it might combine the institution's expertise and reputation with the internet's strength to deliver inexpensive content to a wide audience.</p><p>\"That's when it occurred to us, why not just give our classroom's materials away?\" says Anne Margulies, MIT's executive director of the OCW programme. \"Such a giveaway would potentially provide educators around the world with tools they could use for their own instruction. Students at other institutions too will benefit from access to additional resources as might professionals in related fields.\"</p><p>And it was a good move. The concept of distance learning is not new and with the growth in use of the internet, many of America's leading universities originally planned to make huge profit from the sale of their knowledge. By 2001, this idea had foundered in the face of the dotcom bust. Lecturers realised that they were not going to become rich on their royalties, and that their books and articles would probably be out of print within a decade.</p><p>In late 2001, MIT finally bit the bullet and boldly changed its model by launching the OCW initiative.</p><p>More than five years later, the concept has spread to some 120 universities globally under the aegis of the Open Courseware Consortium, with the aim of educating anyone who has access to the web and a desire to learn.</p><p>MIT's initiative has attracted worldwide attention with 1.4 million users from Darfur to Azerbaijan. It has mirror sites in several developing countries including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ghana, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Uganda and Vietnam, garnering awards for creativity, technology and public service.</p><p>Proponents say the main beneficiaries are those in the developing countries, where students cannot afford essential textbooks and universities lack enough resources to set up courses.</p><p>The main funding for most of these projects is coming from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the charity set up by the American entrepreneur William R Hewlett.</p><p>Now, the concept of OCW has arrived in the UK. And who better to pioneer it than the Open University (OU), which has four decades of creating materials that support the distance learner.</p><p>Since its launch, the OU's Open Learn has attracted more than 100,000 visitors with 7,000 registered users. Their objective is to have 5,400 learning hours of material on the site by next year - that is more than enough to keep a learner studying full-time for two years.</p><p>\"Yes, people are often surprised at the idea that we're giving away our crown jewel,\" says Andy Lane, the director of Open Learn. \"For the first time, we are making some of our educational resources freely available online to anyone in the world.</p><p>\"We are encouraging learners to become self-reliant but also to use online communities to support their learning. We are making it possible for educators to download and adapt our materials for their own purposes.

Nonetheless, breeding and raising clones is not illegal in Britain. \"Would YOU drink its milk?\" asks the Mail.<P>The US Food and Drug Administration says there is \"just not anything that is conceivably hazardous to human health\" in the milk and meat of cloned cows. The paper is sceptical: \"Doesn't it remind you of the similarly sweeping assurances repeatedly trotted out by Britain's top vets that BSE could not be a threat to people? ...

The offspring of the aspirational middle classes (and, increasingly, of immigrant families) are absolutely central to a school's success; nowhere is 'our common endeavour' more important than in joining forces to improve outcomes in individual schools. And that is central to all that a democratic socialist should stand for, because a good educational start offers the key to everything else; it is opportunity. Nothing else comes close. It is because people on the left know this that they send their children to private schools so reluctantly, and find it so excruciating to talk about once they have done so.\"<P>New rules on school admissions are intended to \"loosen the middle-class grip on successful schools \"and will mean that heads will allocate places by lottery rather than catchment area, the Telegraph reports.

Instead, the systems from Practical Action divert water from the stream or river, channel it in to a valley and then drop it into a turbine via a sluice that controls water flow.</p><p>Village-scale hydroelectric schemes have many benefits. They avoid environmental damage. They generate power for domestic lighting and cooking, charging batteries and for money-making activities such as millling grain.</p><p>The cost varies with the project. As a rough guide, says the charity, each kilowatt of generating power costs a little over pounds 800. That is comparable with the cost, for example, of a solar installation in a home in the developed world - but this will run all the time using comparatively cheap materials.</p><p>A system with a capacity of 6KW is big enough to drive a mill and provide electric lighting to 20 families. The cost? pounds 5,000. Once it is installed, the community pays a small charge for the electricity to cover maintenance and the eventual cost of a replacement. Practical Action also backs \"pico\" hydro schemes, which generate between a few hundred and 5KW. One is at Kathamba, 130km north of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. \"At Kathamba, the water supply comes from a stream with a flow rate of at least five litres per second for most of the year - it's small enough to jump across,\" says Jane Eason of Practical Action.</p><p>Your donations can help to light up communities in renewable, affordable ways.

To date it's been specialist organisations like Climate Care (<a href=\"http://www.climatecare.org\">climatecare.org</a>) and small, independent tour operators that have run off-set schemes but this week three major players in the UK travel industry launched their own initiatives, bringing the issue to the forefront of mainstream travel. </p><p>Bookings made with online travel agent <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">lastminute.com</a> now feature a calculator telling you how much carbon your flight will generate, and how much you have to pay to \"neutralise\" the journey - a cost that will automatically be added to your bill. A return flight to Athens, for example, will cost £3.71 to offset and produce 0.53 tonnes of CO2. <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a>'s rather addictive online ready reckoner tells you that this is as damaging as boiling a kettle non-stop for 26 days or leaving your TV on standby for 35 years.  </p><p>Meanwhile, First Choice has announced the first, and largest ever, leisure airline carbon offset scheme. From next March its two and a half million customers will be offered the chance to make a donation (£1 per adult booking) to \"offset a substantial amount of the carbon emitted by the airline\". </p><p>These mainstream additions to the carbon offset lobby are significant because they require customers to \"opt out\" of the carbon-offset fee rather than choosing to take part (as is the case with British Airways's online booking process, for example).</p><p>Apart from <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">lastminute.com</a> and First Choice, the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO) and Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) have joined forces with the Federation of Tour Operators to launch their own offsetting scheme. So where will the money raised by these new initiatives be spent? </p><p>When carbon-offsetting first began (more than 25 years ago in the US) the fashion was for industry to put money into reforestation, on the grounds that trees absorb carbon dioxide and lock up the negative emissions created by burning fossil fuels. The World Bank estimates that 10 million acres of forestry plantations have already been created by offsetting schemes worldwide. This is part of a global carbon market now worth almost £20 billion per year (10 times what it was in 2004). But in some disastrous cases, the wrong types of trees were chosen and they died because they weren't managed properly. </p><p>Climate Care - which operates Last Minute's and First Choice's schemes - still puts 20% of its funding towards planting trees, but the bulk of the money it raises (almost £600,000 in 2004-05) helps to provide backing for micro-loans in the developing world. Michael Buick, spokesman for Climate Care, says, \"Tree planting is still important but it's just one of our strategies including offering micro-credit to developing communities. Instead of telling people not to cut down trees we provide an alternative, and an economic incentive to use new technology.\"</p><p>Typical projects include providing stoves for Mexican women who eke out a living selling tortillas on the street. The new stoves, designed locally, have cut forest wood use by 60%, and each stove is calculated to save 3 tonnes of CO2 per year. Similarly, in Kazakhstan, Climate Care has funded 10,000 low-energy lightbulbs for schools and homes. Kazakhstan's old power stations rely heavily on coal burning, but every new energy efficient light should save 0.1 tonnes of CO2 in a year. And in India it have financed the introduction of  treadle water pumps instead of diesel pumps. Other projects are afoot in Africa and Central America.</p><p>Some campaigners remain adamant that tree-planting must not stop. Ru Hartwell runs <a href=\"http://www.treeflights.com\">Treeflights.com</a>, a business that plants native ash, beech and oak trees on protected land in Wales. Hartwell has bought the land on which he plants, and safeguards his forest by creating legal trusts that will prevent anyone using it for other purposes. </p><p>Lastminute.com and First Choice are not the first travel companies to offer their customers the chance to offset carbon emissions. Africa specialists like Rainbow Tours are also committed to funding offsetting in the countries in which they operate. Co-owner Judith de Witt is convinced that in Africa travellers do more good than harm. \"Since 2002 we have been offsetting some of our clients' carbon footprint by contributing to projects in Madagascar, offering sustainable technology and in creating a tree nursery at Anjajavy. We've also made a decision not to sell things like long weekends in Cape Town, on the grounds that the carbon emissions for a short trip like that are morally unjustifiable.\"</p><p>For companies like Last Minute and First Choice, the potential client base is much larger, and arguably more varied, providing a useful test of just how mainstream carbon offsetting has become. In the first few days of the scheme 10% of lastminute.com's customers have already opted to pay the offsetting fee, surely a sign that this is a market set to grow.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/dec/02/green.saturday","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2006/dec/02/green.saturday","sectionName":"Travel"},{"webTitle":"Practical Action","webPublicationDate":"2006-12-02T15:39:48Z","sectionId":"uk-news","id":"uk/2006/dec/02/christmasappeal2006","fields":{"body":"Practical Action was founded in 1966, as ITDG (the Intermediate Technology Development Group), by the radical economist Dr EF Schumacher to prove that his philosophy of 'Small is Beautiful' could bring real and sustainable improvements to people's lives.<P><hr><P><b>Practical Action's vision</b> <br>A world free of poverty and injustice in which technology is used to the benefit of all.<P><b>Practical Action's mission</b> <br>Practical Action aims to eradicate poverty in developing countries by developing and using technology, and by demonstrating results, sharing knowledge and influencing others.<P><hr><P>Practical Action has a unique approach to development - we don't start with technology, but with people. The tools may be simple or sophisticated - but to provide long-term, appropriate and practical answers, they must be firmly in the hands of local people: people who shape technology and control it for themselves.<P>Practical Action believes that the right idea - however small - can change lives. It can create jobs, improve health and livelihoods, and help people have better lives. Practical Action's work focuses on four key areas:<P><b>&#183;</b> We help reduce the vulnerability of poor people affected by natural disasters, conflict and environmental degradation - events which, sadly, are increasing. <br><b>&#183;</b> We help poor people to make a better living - by enabling producers to improve their production, processing and marketing. <br><b>&#183;</b> We help poor communities gain access to basic services - like safe, clean water, food, housing and electricity. <br><b>&#183;</b> We help poor communities respond to the challenges of new technologies, helping them to access simple effective technologies that can change lives forever.<P>Practical Action is a charity registered in the United Kingdom which works directly in four regions of the developing world - Latin America, East Africa, Southern Africa and South Asia, with particular concentration on Peru, Kenya, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal.<P>In these countries, Practical Action works with poor communities to develop appropriate technologies in food production, agroprocessing, energy, transport, small enterprise development, shelter and disaster mitigation.<P>Lessons from Practical Action's grassroots experience are spread through consultancy services, publishing activities, education, advocacy and campaigns, and through an international technical enquiries service.<P><b>History</b> <br>In 1965, radical economist and philosopher Fritz Schumacher had an article published in the Observer. In it he pointed out the inadequacies of conventional aid policies based, as they were then, on the transfer of modern, capital-intensive and large-scale technologies to developing countries which did not have the financial resources, technical skills or mass markets to accommodate them. He argued that there should be a shift in emphasis towards 'intermediate technologies' based on the needs and skills possessed by the people of developing countries. Schumacher and a few of his associates decided to create an 'advisory centre' to promote the use of efficient labour-intensive techniques and in 1966 the Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG) - now known as Practical Action - was born.<P><P><b>The Group initially saw its aims as:</b> <br><b>&#183;</b> Promoting the systematic assembly and documentation of all data relating to intermediate techniques and technologies. <br><b>&#183;</b> Drawing attention to them by publishing information about them, promoting the concept of Intermediate Technology, and advertising the group's services. <br><b>&#183;</b> Offering advice and assistance to overseas projects in order to demonstrate the practical use of intermediate technologies in helping poor people to help themselves.<P>By 1968 technical enquiries and requests for information on tools and techniques had started to pour in and a decision was taken to set up an Enquiry Service which utilised voluntary experts from academic and research institutions, industry and government specially for the purpose. This decision to invoke voluntary help was an important feature of the Group's method of operation during its first 10 years. Not only did it mobilise a wide range of expertise at very little cost; it also helped to spread the word and influence thinking within the UK. But it wasn't long before a greater direct involvement in local projects in the 'Third World' was required. The need to service the expert panels led to the direct employment of project engineers and the creation of the Group's first Technical Units: the forerunners of today's international programmes.<P>In 1969 Intermediate Technology Consultants was founded as a company to provide services to organisations such as the ODA, the World Bank, etc, on appropriate technology. By the end of 1970 the Group had created panels for Agriculture, Building, Co-operatives, Education and Training, Food Processing, Water, Power, Rural Health, and Women in Development.<P><b>&#183;</b> <a href=\"http://practicalaction.org\">http://practicalaction.org</a>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/02/christmasappeal2006","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2006/dec/02/christmasappeal2006","sectionName":"UK news"},{"webTitle":"Earthshakers: the top 100 green campaigners of all time","webPublicationDate":"2006-11-28T10:11:22Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2006/nov/28/climatechange.climatechangeenvironment","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday December 13 2006</strong></p><p> The Friends of the Earth founder is David Brower (not Bower).

And it does mean all time: St Francis of Assisi (1182-1226) is there, as is Siddartha Gautama Buddha, who died in 483BC.</p><p>Top of the list is Rachel Carson, a US scientist whose 1962 book, Silent Spring, is credited by many with kick-starting the modern environmental movement. Her account of the damage caused by the unrestrained industrial use of pesticides provoked controversy and fury in equal measures. Barbara Young, the Environment Agency's chief executive, said: \"She started many of us off on the road to environmental protection.\"</p><p>At number two is the maverick economist EF Schumacher, a German national rescued from an internment camp in the English countryside by John Keynes, who went on to achieve worldwide fame with his green-tinged economic vision.</p><p>Jonathan Porritt, head of the Sustainable Development Commission, is third, with the wildlife broadcaster David Attenborough, fourth.

There are journalists too, including the Guardian's George Monbiot (23) and Paul Brown (80). And some surprises: few would consider an oil boss an eco-hero, but Lord John Browne has done enough to turn BP around to make the list at 85.</p><p>Mark Funnell, managing editor of the agency's magazine Your Environment, which published the list, said: \"We tend to get incredibly negative about people and their effect on the planet. There are some who have done fantastic things and we wanted to celebrate that.\"</p><p>Not all the candidates have left their carbon footprints on the real world. Tom and Barbara from the BBC TV show the Good Life are at 91 while Father Christmas completes the list at 100, for his \"sleek, no-carbon operation\".</p><p><strong>1 Rachel Carson, Author of Silent Spring</strong></p><p>Seen by many as the patron saint of the green movement, Rachel Carson's reputation was sealed by the 1962 publication of Silent Spring, a passionate and revelatory account of the damage done by the unrestrained use of pesticides.</p><p>A writer, scientist and ecologist from rural Pennsylvania, she studied at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory and received an MA in zoology from Johns Hopkins University in 1932.</p><p>First hired by the US Bureau of Fisheries to write radio scripts during the depression, she supplemented her income writing features on natural history for the Baltimore Sun. A 15-year career in the federal service as a scientist and editor followed from 1936, and she rose to editor in chief of all publications for the US Fish and Wildlife Service.</p><p>In 1952 she resigned to focus on writing, and published a prize-winning study of the ocean, The Sea Around Us, followed by The Edge of the Sea in 1955. Essentially a biography of the ocean, the books made Carson famous as a naturalist and science writer. Disturbed by the widespread use of synthetic chemical pesticides after the second world war, she switched focus and wrote Silent Spring. The book is credited with launching the concept of the environment as a system that sustains us and that we must learn to live within, rather than a mine, dump or playground. It infuriated government and industrial interests and she was attacked by lobbyists as an alarmist. She died in 1964 after a long battle against breast cancer.</p><p><strong>2 EF Schumacher, Green economist</strong></p><p>Schumacher's 1973 book Small is Beautiful rewrote the rules by questioning whether the objectives of western economics were desirable. Ernst Friedrich was born in Bonn, but made his name in the UK after attracting the attention of John Keynes. He was feted by alternative circles in the 1960s for unorthodox thinking, and his opposition to nuclear power and the use of chemicals in agriculture. He was an early critic of economic growth as a measure of national progress and helped to found the Soil Association. Small is Beautiful catapulted him to international attention: he was invited to meet US president Jimmy Carter and he even received death threats. He died in 1977.</p><p><strong>3 Jonathan Porritt, Government adviser</strong></p><p>An early activist with the Green party in the 1970s (then the Ecology party) and later party chairman. He gave up teaching in 1984 to lead Friends of the Earth. In 1996 he helped to found Forum for the Future. Tony Blair made him head of the Sustainable Development Commission in 2001, but he remains a critic of government policy on nuclear power and in 2005 urged the prime minister to \"bang heads\" across departments to combat greenhouse gas emissions. He irked some activists with his book Capitalism As If The World Matters, in which he argued that environmentalists must embrace a \"evolved, intelligent and elegant\" form of capitalism.</p><p><strong>4 David Attenborough, TV naturalist</strong></p><p>The voice of wildlife, conservation and all things that wriggle, fly and roam across planet Earth, Sir David is still going strong at 80. His programmes have brought the natural world into the living rooms of millions over 50 years and his contribution to public awareness of natural science brought him a fellowship of the Royal Society. A Reader's Digest poll this year voted him most trusted celebrity in Britain.</p><p>He has drawn rare criticism from some environmentalists, who have complained that his programmes do not sufficiently reflect man's impact on the natural world, although he has become more outspoken for green causes in recent years.</p><p><strong>5 James Lovelock, Biologist</strong></p><p>Best known for his Gaia theory, which says the Earth's biosphere works as a single living organism, able to manipulate the climate and chemistry of the atmosphere and the oceans to keep them fit for life. The idea was hugely influential among fellow scientists and environmentalists, and religious and spiritual thinkers. An ex-Nasa scientist, his work on the Viking Mars missions sparked an interest in the way planets function.</p><p>More recently he courted controversy by public supporting nuclear power and increasingly dire predictions on the consequences of climate change for the human race. His book The Revenge of Gaia predicts that billions will die by the end of the century, with survivors forced to live in the Arctic. He argues that the phrase \"global warming\" fails to reflect the seriousness of the problem and wants it replaced with \"global heating\".</p><p><strong>6 Wangari Maathai, Conservationist</strong></p><p>Africa's \"tree woman'\"who founded the green belt movement in Kenya in 1977 and was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2004. The movement has since planted more than 10m trees to prevent soil erosion and provide firewood for cooking fires. Most have been planted by poor women in the villages of Kenya, restoring their environment and providing paid work. Born in 1940 in Nyeri, Wangari, she trained as a scientist in the US before returning to Kenya to do a PhD. She gained worldwide attention in 1998 by helping to defeat plans by Kenya's president to clear hundreds of acres of forest for luxury housing. Jailed several times by previous administrations, she was elected to parliament in 2002 and is now environment minister.</p><p><strong>7 Prince of Wales, Green royal</strong></p><p>Once derided for talking to plants, Charles Windsor's passion for the environment and green issues such as locally produced organic foods have won him admirers and brought the issues to public attention. Last year he spoke out on climate change, calling it the greatest challenge to face man.</p><p>He said: \"We should be treating, I think, the whole issue of climate change and global warming with a far greater degree of priority than I think is happening now.\"</p><p><strong>8 William Morris, Craftsman and writer</strong></p><p>Remembered by environmentalists for his pioneering predictions of the problems caused by unsustainable industrialisation. His utopian view of a society in harmony with nature still inspires generations of sustainable-living advocates.</p><p><strong>9 Al Gore, US politician</strong></p><p>US former vice president defeated by George Bush in the infamous \"hanging chad\" recount presidential election of 2000. His long-lasting interest in environmental matters, and climate change in particular, was sealed with this year's release of his film An Inconvenient Truth, which has helped to drive the issue on to the mainstream agenda.</p><p><strong>10 Gro Harlem Brundtland, Former Norwegian PM</strong></p><p>The Scandinavian polar opposite to Margaret Thatcher during the 1980s, her views of sustainable development seemed radical at the time, but are common political language now. Her 1987 report, Our Common Future, laid the ground for the 1992 Rio Earth summit.</p><p><strong>11 Richard Sandbrook, Campaigner</strong></p><p>The biologist and accountant, who died last year aged 59, had a profound influence on the green movement and the world of international development. He helped to set up Friends of the Earth UK, the Eden project and Forum for the Future. At the International Institute for Environment and Development he was instrumental in bringing together the poverty and environment agendas.</p><p><strong>12 Amory Lovins, US energy guru</strong></p><p>Top green thinker who launched Friends of the Earth in Britain and founded the Rocky Mountain Institute, a technology thinktank that develops blueprints for low-energy devices such as the \"hypercar\".

She has had a vast impact on a range of issues from forest conservation to GM crops,from world trade policy to organic farming.</p><p><strong>14 Ansel Adams, Wilderness photographer</strong></p><p>Well known for his photographs of the mountain ranges, deserts, rivers and skies of the US, Adams was a passionate lover of the outdoors and an active conservationist. He commented: \"My approach to photography is based on my belief in the vigour and values of the world of nature - in the aspects of grandeur and of the minutiae all about us.\"</p><p><strong>15 Fritjof Capra, Austrian physicist</strong></p><p>An Austrian doctor of theoretical physics, based in California, he combines an interest in eastern mysticism with a fascination for what makes the planet tick. His most recent book, Hidden Systems: A Science for Sustainable Living, argues the need for a natural rather than a technical toolkit to tackle the impending global crisis.</p><p><strong>16 Aldo Leopold, US ecologist</strong></p><p>Widely acknowledged as the founder of wildlife management as a discipline and profession, he was one of the greatest US ecologists. His writings on conservation and the value of the wild to civilisation are highly regarded. The most famous, A Sand County Almanac, inspired many to follow in his footsteps.</p><p><strong>17 Chico Mendez, Brazilian anti-logger activist</strong></p><p>A Brazilian rubber tapper, unionist and environmental activist who fought to stop logging in the Amazon rainforest for cattle ranching. He was murdered by ranchers opposed to his activism.</p><p><strong>18 David Bellamy, TV botanist</strong></p><p>A formidable campaigner for green causes, including saving a Tasmanian rainforest from flooding by a dam project.

Frost starts talking to a worldwide al-Jazeera audience on Friday. He tells Oliver Burkeman why he's doing the show","webPublicationDate":"2006-11-15T07:37:48Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/2006/nov/15/tvnews.broadcasting","fields":{"body":"<p>Sir David Frost presents the first of his weekly shows on the new English-language version of al-Jazeera this Friday, kicking off by interviewing Tony Blair. It will be broadcast to almost 50 countries, and it is strange to think that there will be people watching for whom Frost has not become a perennially comforting screen presence, a sort of televisual malted-milk drink, dependable and unchanging even as prime ministers and presidents come and go. What will they make of him in Malaysia, Honduras, or the Maldives, in Finland and Kenya, in Thailand, Lebanon or Uganda? If they're expecting the searing images of war and hard-edged debate with which the Arabic version of the channel made its name, how on earth will they respond to Frostie, all pinstripes, red socks and (if you believe his critics) insufficiently challenging sofa chats?</p><p>This is not something 67-year-old Frost has been troubling himself with, since, in more than four decades of interviewing world leaders on television, he says it has never occurred to him to feel nervous. He remembers being a guest on an Australian talkshow once, appearing alongside Leonard Bernstein. The host asked Bernstein when he planned to retire. \"And he said: 'I shall retire the moment that, before a performance, I cease to feel sick in the pit of my stomach! I shall retire the moment that, before a performance, I cease to feel the pain running up and down my spine!'\" Frost recalls. \"I said, 'That's funny. I shall retire the moment that I start feeling like that.' It would be a nightmare, I should think.\"</p><p>We're talking in Frost's west London headquarters, a low-ceilinged office that is strikingly modest in view of his reputation as a lover of luxury, hopping on to Concorde - or, better yet, on to the private planes of aristocratic pals - as casually as he might hail a taxi. The office walls, naturally enough, are covered in photographs of Frost with the leaders he has met and interviewed (every prime minister since Wilson, and every president since Nixon, for starters). A sizeable collection of free newspaper giveaway CDs sits on a coffee table, and the smell of cigar smoke hangs thickly in the air. There is no computer: Frost is proudly technology-illiterate. He appears to take great pleasure in describing how English al-Jazeera's four \"broadcast hubs\", in Washington, Doha, London and Kuala Lumpur, will be linked by \"some sort of magic fibre\", to eliminate satellite delays.</p><p>His oddly titled show, Frost Over the World, will feature current-affairs discussions with commentators based in all four places, though the familiar review of the papers - a mainstay over 10 years of the BBC's Breakfast With Frost - will not be included. \"Getting the Sunday papers from Kuala Lumpur would be an effort,\" Frost says. \"So it'll be more of a global debate.\"</p><p>He did have qualms about signing up to the channel, not least because it was regularly criticised by the American right, after the invasion of Iraq, as providing a propaganda platform for extremists. The critics included people whom Frost respects, such as US president George Bush (\"He's got more weight than the traditional caricature\") and his former defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld (\"He was confident of his intellectual ability ... and he said he was much impressed by my red socks\"). \"So I deliberately checked out, with Whitehall and with Washington, that there were no links with al-Qaida, for instance, that sort of thing,\" he says. \"And it was not really a surprise that there were no such links, because Qatar, the proprietor of al-Jazeera, is also our most important ally in the Middle East.\"</p><p>It is possible, of course, to see the al-Jazeera job as little more than a retirement gig. Age has by no means left Frost untouched; his coffee cup shakes perilously in his hand, and examples of his rambling questions are regularly cited as evidence of his decline. The allegation is that Frost went soft long ago, following a spiky start on the revolutionary satire show That Was The Week That Was and one of the earliest instances of \"trial by television\", his interview with the insurance fraudster Emil Savundra. Is he insulted by the suggestion that he has been pitching softballs ever since?</p><p>\"That doesn't anger me at all,\" he says, puffing rapidly for some seconds on his cigar in an attempt to relight it. \"I'm quite relaxed about it. Through the years, one would hope one's techniques develop into new forms. I always think interviewers who get hostile with politicians when they don't have a smoking pistol are making a mistake. Because they tend to shut the guy up, and your task is to open the person up, and you can do that, often, in a relatively civilised, relatively relaxed way.\" Invasive personal questions are notably absent from his repertoire, too, and he expects the same treatment for himself. A few years ago he made the headlines when his second wife, Lady Carina Frost, was rushed to hospital following a suspected drugs overdose, but when the subject is raised, he replies, straightforwardly: \"There are some things which are private.\"</p><p>The gentle approach can definitely yield results. Take Frost's interview with Blair in September 2002, when the subject was President Bush. \"Both you and he are greatly men of faith, and so on,\" Frost tells the prime minister, in one of his gentle conversational run-ups. \"I mean, do you pray together?\" In no Paxmanesque berating of Blair have I seen anything to compare with the way the prime minister's eyes open wide in terror at this question. \"Pray together?\" he replies. \"How do you mean?\" Right there, in those wide-open eyes, the excruciating highwire act of Blair's alliance with Republican Washington - what he must say for the Americans, what he can't say to the Brits - is suddenly crystallised. (Eventually, he recovers. \"Well we don't say prayers together, no,\" he says. \"But I'm sure he in his way hopes for peace, and I hope for peace too.\")</p><p>The gentle approach worked in 1977, too, when Richard Nixon finally chose Frost over several competing American broadcasters and sat down for 28 hours of interviews, culminating in the closest thing the disgraced president ever gave to an admission of responsibility for the Watergate scandal. As the current West End play Frost/Nixon makes clear, money was a consideration - Frost paid $600,000 out of his own pocket for the interviews, ignoring US qualms about chequebook journalism - but so was the perception that Frost was a lightweight. \"I had not been on television, in the news, batting away every night for a year about Watergate. I suspect he, or his people, knew more about my talk variety show in the States than they did about Savundra and so on. He thought I might be a sympathetic ear, as it were.\"</p><p>Frost/Nixon also makes the argument that there was as much riding on the Nixon interviews for Frost as there was for the ex-president. His American and Australian shows had been cancelled, and it was a make-or-break moment for his reputation as a serious interviewer. \"It's not that it was the last gasp,\" Frost says. \"But obviously the press and media had such strong feelings about Nixon that if I had not laid a finger on him, it would have been damaging. It would have been a real let-down. That was the reason the reaction from the newspapers the morning after was so fantastic. No one believed you could ever get Nixon to deliver that level of mea culpa.\" The six hours of interviews set a record for an audience for a political television show that has yet to be beaten. Ron Howard is preparing to direct a movie version of Frost/Nixon, from which Frost expects to profit: he agreed to allow the interviews to be used for free for the theatrical production, he says, \"but obviously I'll get my fair share later\".</p><p>The Frost manner has long attracted hostility, giving rise, according to legend, to one of Peter Cook's most crowningly harsh swipes: the observation that his greatest regret in life was saving Frost from drowning. Frost was riling those who see him as a pompous old bore even when he wasn't old. In the 1970 footage of the Yippies appearing on the Frost Programme, there's a tangible unpleasantness in the air as the flower-shirted young revolutionaries sneer at the besuited Frost - a tense episode that culminates in the Yippie figurehead Stewart Albert becoming the first person to use the word \"cunt\" on British television. But looking back from 2006, it is indisputably the Yippies who come across as the more pathetic participants in the exchange. Frost, then as now, is just being Frost.</p><p>And being Frost is an undertaking that shows no signs of demanding less energy as the years advance. \"It's absolutely frantic at the moment,\" he says, reeling off a list of current projects, including a remake of The Dambusters by his production company, Paradine, as well as another Nixon book, more memoirs, and a 20th year of Through the Keyhole on the BBC. This is all in addition to the al-Jazeera show, which ought to provide him with a platform for continuing his interviews with major world figures. Speaking purely hypothetically, I ask him what he'd do if Osama bin Laden offered to talk.</p><p>\"I don't think you could accept, actually,\" Frost says. \"It's a very interesting quandary. I would have thought, in that case, that your duty as a journalist clashes with your duty as a citizen. If you were faced with Osama bin Laden I think your first duty would be to perform, or to attempt to perform, a citizen's arrest.\"</p><p>I have a sudden image of a somewhat frail Frost being pinned to the wall of a cave by Bin Laden's Kalashnikov-wielding bodyguards. There are no sofas in this mental picture, no pot of coffee, no selection of that day's newspapers spread out on the table. It is not, on balance, the kind of thing he was cut out for.</p><p><strong>&middot;</strong> Al-Jazeera in English launches today at 12 noon on Skychannel 514.

Uncurbed, air travel is set to become the fastest-growing contributor to climate change. It also necessitates continued airport expansion, which has implications for local environments. There remains no tax on aviation fuel, and a nationwide airport expansion plan is in clear contradiction to efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Meanwhile a single flight from Paris to New York uses up one-and-a-half times a person's overall carbon ration (the estimated amount each person can 'safely' produce) for an entire year, according to the transport expert Dr Mayer Hillman.<P><b>What you can do</b><P>According to <a href=\"http://www.nofly.co.uk\">www.nofly.co.uk</a> one in six of us is unhappy about flying and is considering alternative low-carbon travel options - many of which appear on this website. Their spiritual leader should be Radiohead frontman, Thom Yorke, who broke a celebrity wall of silence when he said world tours and private jets were inappropriate. The industry rejoinder is that aviation contributes just 6 per cent of global emissions, but experts suggest it's more like 11 per cent. Richard Branson says he is searching for solutions by channelling &#163;3 billion of Virgin Atlantic's profits into renewable energy projects - mainly biofuels. Will it help to turn back the tide of global warming? It's hard to see how. If he wants to save the world, he should ground his transatlantic fleet.<P><b>Is it worth it?</b><P>Yes. Pledge to limit or stop your flights at <a href=\"http://www.flightpledge.org.uk\">www.flightpledge.org.uk</a> and research train and boat options at <a href=\"http://www.nofly.co.uk\">www.nofly.co.uk</a> If you really can't avoid flying, avoid night flights and flying during winter - especially long haul: new research shows that both create more carbon dioxide emissions.<P><b>Effectiveness rating</b><P>5/5 - we have to wean ourselves off the &#163;19.99 flight to Spain.<P><b>2: Buy a green car</b><P><b>The problem </b><P>The global fleet of cars continues to expand while the average vehicle produces its own weight in carbon dixiode every 6,000 miles. Quite a sizeable weight, in fact, given that one in seven new cars bought in London last year was of the hulking, gas-guzzler variety.<P><b>What you can do</b><P>You could join the Alliance Against Urban 4x4s (<a href=\"http://www.stopurban4x4s.org.uk/\">www.stopurban4x4s.org.uk</a>), which attempts to shame society into avoiding poor vehicle choices. Or move to Richmond, south-west London, where the council announced that owners of gas-guzzlers would have to pay an increased parking permit charge. Hybrids - in the UK made by Toyota, Honda and Lexus - offer some respite, but aren't the full story. In emissions terms, they are comparable to small, efficient diesels. The biofuels route is an increasingly popular idea, but currently there are only 13 filling stations in the UK. The electric car is the cleanest, scoring the only 'A' rating in the government's league table, but batteries currently only support a 40-mile range.<P><b>Is it worth it?</b><P>The mistake some drivers can make is ditching their old model in order to run out and buy a new hybrid. This is no panacea. Given that your original car created 15 tonnes of waste and 75m cubic metres of polluted air just in production, you should hang on to it and try to mitigate its effects, by converting to LPG for example. Change your driving style, too: it has a big effect on your emissions. Correct tyre pressure can chop 10 per cent off petrol costs, decreasing your speed from 75mph to 65mph increases fuel economy and don't idle - it increases emissions by 13 per cent (<a href=\"http://www.eta.co.uk\">www.eta.co.uk</a> has more). The Eco-log (<a href=\"http://www.ecodrive.org\">www.ecodrive.org</a>) is a device that tells you when you are driving to maximum potential. If you are buying a new car, go for a lightweight, fuel-efficient model - every 10 per cent drop in car weight decreases carbon emissions by 5-6 per cent. But do you really need a car? The greenest drivers join a car club (<a href=\"http://www.citycarclub.co.uk\">www.citycarclub.co.uk</a>)<P><b>Effectiveness rating</b><P>2/5 - just having a car is a problem, frankly.<P><b>3: Switch off</b><P><b>The problem </b><P>UK households are horribly energy-inefficient (the worst in Europe). We have a penchant for tumble dryers (4,000 watts per hour), leaving appliances on standby and using energy intensive incandescent bulbs. The average household uses 10 kWh every day on powering lights and appliances alone, and overall spews out six tonnes of carbon dioxide. Inside the home, average domestic temperatures are up from 13C in the 1970s to 19-21C now.<P><b>What you can do</b><P>Brenda Boardman, of the Environmental Research Institute, believes every household could get their electricity usage down to just five kilowatt-hours a day relatively easily. Turn appliances off standby (which consumes 10-60 per cent of an appliance's electricity) and we could save enough electricity to power 2.7 million homes for a year.<P><b>Is it worth it?</b><P>Yes. Insulating your loft is key - more than 40 per cent of heat is lost through walls and the roof. Turn down your thermostat by one degree and you'll save around 230kg of carbon dioxide a year. Go to <a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.co.uk/commit\">www.energysavingtrust.co.uk</a> for more ideas. Wash your clothes at 30C, then hang them on the line, and unplug your mobile phone charger when not in use. A fridge over 20 years old should be upgraded to an energy-efficient model. Invest in an Electrisave (<a href=\"http://www.electrisave.co.uk\">www.electrisave.co.uk</a>) or similar smart meter to tell you how much electricity you are consuming.<P><b>Effectiveness rating</b><P>5/5 - it's easy and worth it.<P><b>4: Go on to a low-carbon diet</b><P><b>The problem </b><P>Thousands of goods we buy off the shelves are now as well travelled as the average celebrity or cabinet minister. One kiwi fruit flown from New Zealand, for instance, emits five times its own weight in carbon dioxide emissions and the average shopping basket of food has clocked up the same miles as flying to the moon. Between 25 and 30 per cent of the UK's overall carbon dioxide emissions are attributed to food production and transportation. Food miles also tarnish organic food's halo - 70 per cent is imported.<P><b>What you can do</b><P>Start counting carbon calories generated by food miles, rather than the traditional dietary variety, and support calls for food miles to be printed on packaging. Research by Tim Lang, from City University in London, concludes that eating produce from within a 12-mile radius would reduce UK environmental costs by a spectacular &#163;2 billion.<P><b>Is it worth it?</b><P>Even professional food foragers would be hard-pressed to find enough grub within a 12-mile radius of their home. More realistic is to give yourself a 100-mile 'production zone' for food - most farmers' markets source within 50 miles - and join the movement promoting 'local eating for global change' (<a href=\"http://www.100milediet.org\">www.100milediet.org</a>). And remember, food is not the only consumable with a high carbon calorific content: last year, 19,000 tonnes of flowers were imported into the UK from Kenya, racking up 33,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. Give them a miss and buy local flowers.<P><b>Effectiveness rating</b><P>3/5 - important, but there are probably better things you can do.<P><b>5: Make your own power</b><P><b>The problem </b><P>As in-house energy demands increase, so does the pressure on power production. Three-quarters of our electricity comes from coal and gas-fired plants spewing out carbon dioxide: Drax contributed 20.8 million tonnes last year.<P><b>What you can do</b><P>Microgeneration - turning your house into a power-creating hub by adding solar panels and a small wind turbine - is a liberating idea. Industry estimates suggest that, by 2050, microgeneration could provide 30-40 per cent of total electricity needs. But currently only 100,000 British homes have any form of microgeneration, although the idea is becoming more mainstream: Currys recently began selling solar panel systems at &#163;9,000.<P><b>Is it worth it?</b><P>Choose your technology carefully: wind turbines are not suitable for every house. Also bear in mind that the DTI's Low Carbon Energy Programme grants have apparently run out already, so payback times will be even longer. Solar thermal is by far the easiest and most cost-effective technology and can produce at least 70 per cent of a family's hot water during summer.<P>Get your own house in order first with insulation and energy reduction targets. If you are itching to embrace renewables, changing your electricity supplier to Good Energy or Ecotricity will speed the revolution quicker than an mini-turbine.<P><b>Effectiveness rating</b><P>2/5 - a tricky thing to do on your own, better to reduce your demand.<P><b>Case study: </b><P>Gilles Jourdan, 30, and Cecilie Maurud Barstad, 29, live and work in east London. They never go to supermarkets, rarely use public transport and try to use sustainable, local materials in their work as graphic designers. 'I think you need to be in touch with yourself and the environment by eating proper food and being active,' said Barstad. 'If you have a bicycle, you get around, you stay healthy and that's good for yourself and the community.' She added that she gave up a book-binding business because she did not want to continue importing the materials from China, as the journey used too much aviation fuel.<P>'We're not what you would term \"super-green\", but we're concerned about environmental issues,' added Jourdan. 'We're not buying things we don't need; we don't consume things we would not use for a long time. We want to buy things that last a lifetime,' he continued. 'We buy local when we can and we buy vegetables when they're in season.' They often looked online to find when and where farmers' markets were open and planned their week accordingly.<P>Barstad, originally from Norway, inherited her concern about the environment from her parents, who live close to a 'retreating ice shelf' on Spitzbergen. 'The ice retreats further north each year. It makes life difficult for the polar bears. I just spoke to my auntie and she said the birds left just now; they left later than they usually do because the summer lasted longer. My auntie said: \"I hope they make it to Africa.\" It's not fair that we're changing the world just because people want to fly all around the globe whenever they want.'"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/29/greenpolitics.economy1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2006/oct/29/greenpolitics.economy1","sectionName":"Politics"},{"webTitle":"Letters: Spreading impact of climate change","webPublicationDate":"2006-10-26T23:02:05Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/2006/oct/27/guardianletters.climatechange","fields":{"body":"<p>Jonathan Freedland is right that climate change affects more policy areas than many realise (Comment, October 25 ).

This could provide a framework for the many measures now needed to avoid catastrophic global warming. Throughout 2006, the Co-operative Bank and its customers have been campaigning for such a bill. But we are disappointed that the government appears to be resisting a law requiring year-on-year reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Our recently commissioned research by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change (The Future Starts Here) details the UK's carbon budget and shows the government has just four years in which to introduce policies that will begin reducing our emissions year-on-year if we are to have a chance of achieving the required reductions by 2050.<br /> <strong>Simon Williams </strong><br /> Co-operative Bank<br /></p><p>The government should now press hard for an international system of contraction and convergence and introduce a carbon ration. As a first step, why not extend the EU environmental trading system downwards to all but the domestic sector as a quick halfway step and remove all remaining barriers to microgeneration? In this way, almost everyone would have some contact with carbon trading and emissions.<br /> <strong>Neil Hollow</strong><br /> Edinburgh<br /></p><p>A new bill would provide an early opportunity to reform the Renewables Obligation. This mechanism could provide the funding needed to make Britain a world leader in a range of renewable and microgeneration technology. In its current form, it only subsidises multinational power companies while they industrialise great swathes of our most beautiful countryside with wind power stations. The government must not miss this chance to adopt a holistic approach: one that respects our landscapes and natural environment, that promotes a sustainable approach to transport, and that links the effects of individual behaviour to the effects on society as a whole.<br /> <strong>Christine Elliott</strong><br /> Chief executive, Ramblers' Association<br /></p><p>The idea of charging for parking space according to vehicle type offers food for thought (Science, October 25). But by suggesting electric cars should go free, Richmond council shows it really has no idea about emission control. When it comes to carbon dioxide emission, electric cars are some of the worst offenders. A power station and a good diesel motor are both capable, at peak performance, of 30% to 33% efficiency. But the electric system has significant transmission losses of at least 10%.</p><p>A battery charger might hope to be 80% efficient. A good battery won't do any better, nor will the drive motor. So from the power station to the wheels the losses are at least 0.9 (transmission), then 0.8 (charger), then 0.8 (battery) and then 0.8 (motor), which together come to 0.46. Even when we try to be kind to it, the electric drive is, overall, more than twice as polluting as a diesel engine.<br /> <strong>Harry Butterworth</strong><br /> Reading, Berkshire</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/oct/27/guardianletters.climatechange","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2006/oct/27/guardianletters.climatechange","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"What happened to the cashless society?","webPublicationDate":"2006-09-29T09:14:52Z","sectionId":"money","id":"money/2006/sep/29/consumernews.technology","fields":{"body":"<p>According to a recent\nreport from the Post\nOffice, we are still a\nnation of cash lovers.\nOne in 10 of\nus feel naked if we\ndon't carry cash. Although\nthe majority of shops now accept electronic payments,\neight out of 10 people in the UK still like\nto carry cash at all times. On average we\nlike to carry &#163;23 in ready cash, totalling\n&#163;871m in the nation's pockets on a dayto-\nday basis.</p><p>\"The survey raises the cash versus plastic\ndebate,\" says Graham Halliday, banking\nand financial services director at the\nPost Office. \"And while younger generations feel more comfortable using debit\nor credit cards for some of their smaller\ntransactions, as a nation, we still love\ngood old fashioned cash. We found that\nalthough plastic provides us with a fast\nand convenient way to shop, people feel\nhappier knowing they have cash in their\npockets, whether this is for emergencies,\nto keep control over spending, or because\nit's the easiest method of payment.\"</p><p>So what happened to the cashless society?\nThe most high profile attempt at\nintroducing an e-payment system aimed\nat low value (below &#163;10) transactions of\nrecent years was from Transport for London\n(TfL), which attempted to extend\nthe capabilities of its Oyster travel card\nfor use as an e-wallet. Since its inception\nover 6m Oyster cards have been issued. In\nany given four-week period, 3.5m cards\nare used, which equates to 67% of all\njourneys on London's transport systems.</p><p>This installed user base makes Oyster an\nideal e-payment platform. However, TfL\ncited the inability of suppliers to reconcile\nthe \"commercial arrangements\" that\nwould make the e-payment component\nof the Oyster card a reality, so the project\nhas stalled.</p><p>Adam Smith, CEO of Squidcard, which\nwill be launching its own e-payment card\nin London next year, believes TfL simply\ntried to bite off more than it could chew.\nSo why should his company's system\nsucceed? \"Our stance is different because\nwe're not coming at it from a bank\nperspective, and that means there are no\nlegacy systems, plus no network restrictions\neither.\"</p><p>But Dave Birch, director of consultancy\nConsult Hyperion and organiser of the\nDigital Money Forum, supports TfL's account\nof the difficulties the Oyster card\nhas had extending its capabilities. \"TfL\ndidn't say that there was no demand, or\nthat the whole thing had fallen apart.</p><p>\"What it said was it hadn't been able\nto agree an appropriate commercial\nmodel with the people that it had been\ntalking to. So it was time to go back to\nthe drawing board. If you look at places\nlike Hong Kong and Singapore, the transit\nguys run the payments card and the\npayment service.</p><p>\"Where there is a structural difference in\nLondon, of course, is that TfL doesn't run\nthe card. This is run by a PFI consortium,\nwhich introduces an extra interface.\"</p><p>Ultimately, the Achilles heel of any\ne-payments system is the symbiotic relationship\nbetween the card holder and\nthe merchant. If either of these groups\ndoesn't have faith in the system, it simply\nwon't reach a critical mass to justify\nthe cost of installing the infrastructure.</p><p>Chris Barling, CEO of Actinic, says we\nshouldn't read too much into Oyster's\nsetback. \"I don't think too much should\nbe drawn from the failure of the Oyster\ncard to move into mainstream retail. It\nwas being promoted by a public body that\nwas hoping to make a bit of easy money\non the side, with no risk.</p><p>\"Since success in this field requires\nhuge commitment, it's not surprising\nthat problems have been encountered. It\nrequires a critical number of both buyers\nand sellers to get off the ground.\"</p><p><strong>Contentious issue</strong></p><p>Who pays for the infrastructure that supports\nany e-payment systems is always\ngoing to be a contentious issue. Sandra\nQuinn, director of corporate communications\nat APACS, says: \"I use my debit\ncard to pay for my sandwich in M&amp;S.\nThey must hate it because they pay disproportionately\nfor the transaction . But\nas customers, as long as they're allowing\nit, I don't care, because I'm not getting\ncharged for it - they are.\"</p><p>Over the last few years the number of\npayment systems that have become available\nfor online and mobile purchases has\nmushroomed. BT's click&amp;buy, which\nlaunched in 2002, now has 300,000 subscribers\nin 180 countries. The service has\nbeen slow to take off, but BT is now pushing\nto widen its appeal.</p><p>The massively successful PayPal stands\nhead and shoulders above almost all other\nonline payment schemes. With nearly 64\nmillion users across 45 countries making\n$19bn in transactions last year, PayPal is\na force in online payments that no business\ncan afford to ignore. Outside of its\nrelationship with eBay, many businesses\nnow routinely off er PayPal as a payment\noption on their websites - despite high\ntransaction costs compared to other payment\nsystems - simply because their customers\ndemand it.</p><p>In a bid to cement its position as the\nleader in online advertising, Google has\nlaunched Checkout. Supporting its massively\nsuccessful AdWords advertising\nprogram, merchants can now place their\nadvertisements and pay without leaving\nGoogle. In the same way that PayPal complements\neBay, Checkout is designed to\noff er similar integration for AdWords users.\nWhether Checkout will be expanded\ninto other sectors has yet to be seen.</p><p><strong>Paying with your phone</strong><br /></p><p>The mobile phone, of course, is touted as\nthe next mass e-payment system. Dave\nBirch of Consult Hyperion agrees. \"I don't\nthink it's particularly going out on a limb\nto say that in 10 years' time it will be extremely\nunlikely to see you pay for anything\nin a shop with a plastic card . You'll\nstill be using your credit card. It just won't\nactually be a card. It will be something on\nyour phone.\"</p><p>This vision of the future is already taking\nshape. In countries that don't have\nan extensive banking infrastructure, the\nmobile phone network is seen as a possible\nsolution to increase the accessibility\nto fi nancial services. One product in\ndevelopment is M-PESA, which enables\ncustomers to borrow, transfer and pay\nmoney using SMS text messages. M-PESA\nis currently being piloted with 1,000 people\nin Kenya in partnership with the Department\nfor International Development,\nVodafone's affi liate Safaricom, the Commercial\nBank of Africa and Faulu Kenya,\na local micro finance organisation.</p><p>There are now a number of e-payment\noptions all jockeying for position, but\nwhat is certain is the next evolution of\ne-payments will be with contactless systems.\nThe use of RFID technology enables\nthe existing card payment infrastructure\nto move to wireless payments with very\nlittle effort.</p><p>\"We envisage contactless technology\nsitting on your existing card,\" says Colin\nGrannell of Visa UK. \"It could be on your\ndebit card, or it could be on your credit\ncard. Or it might be in your telephone,\ntoo. We've already done some pilots with\nNokia. But let's not call them cardholders,\nbecause the payment mechanism might\nnot be cards.\"</p><p>The cashless society is coming, it's\njust taking a while for merchants and\nconsumers to adopt the new forms of\ne-payment systems that are becoming\navailable. Money on the move is clearly\nwhere the future of e-payments lies. The\nmobile phone is now just as ubiquitous as\nthe credit or debit card and, as a payment\nplatform, it seems ideally positioned\nto offer speed and convenience to merchants\nand consumers alike.</p><p>For business it still makes sense to offer\na wide range of payment options at\nthe till or at the online checkout. Consumers\nwill eventually adopt a number\nof payment options that suit them.

The Guardian says he will commit to tackling climate change in a bid to wrest the issue away from the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.<P>The two papers say he will till the conference: \"New Labour will never retreat, but positively entrench our position in the centre ground - in the mainstream as the party of reform.\"<P>The Mail interprets this as a \"warning to potential Blairite challengers who seek to portray him as a left-winger\". The paper predicts the speech will do little to soothe the chancellor's often fraught relationship with Mr Blair, claiming it will be seen \"as a damning rejection of what he believes is the corruption and sleaze that marks Tony Blair's political legacy\".<P>The Sun, meanwhile, claims the chancellor will pay tribute to the prime minister and \"sensationally praise\" his leadership in the war on terror.<P>In its leader column, the paper says Mr Brown is the only member of the government who has \"proved his ability and capacity for the job\" of prime minister - but warns there should be a leadership contest to resolve the splits in Labour.<P>The Independent claims \"a dream ticket\" of the education secretary, Alan Johnson, and the home secretary, John Reid, is being proposed by \"ultra-Blairites\" in a bid to prevent Mr Brown from becoming prime minister.<P>But it's the Telegraph's lead story that will most trouble the chancellor. A poll conducted for the paper shows him lagging behind the Tory leader, David Cameron, and \"even Mr Blair\" as the voters' preferred choice of prime minister.<P>The YouGov poll gives Mr Cameron a five-point lead over Mr Brown as \"the best minister\", and Mr Blair was ahead when voters were asked to choose between them.<P>* <a href=\"http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1880256,00.html\">Brown plants flag firmly in centre ground</a><br> * Times: <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-2373790,00.html\">Brown to stake all on middle England</a><br> * Mail: <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=406797&in_page_id=1770\">Brown to consign Blair era to history by offering revolution</a><br> * Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=FUJEZB1VC2QNFQFIQMFCFFOAVCBQYIV0?xml=/news/2006/09/25/nlabour25.xml\">Poll blow for Brown as Blair refuses to back him</a><P><b>ROTTWEILERS MAUL BABY TO DEATH</b><P>The horrific story of a baby mauled to death by two rottweilers is the lead story in both the Sun and the Mirror.<P>The guard dogs, called Bruno and Bess, dragged five-month old Caydee-Lee Glaze from her cot onto the flat roof of a pub in Leicester, where witnesses said she was savaged beyond recognition. \"They went for her face and simply ripped her apart.

Its precursor, the Polytechnic Institution opened its doors in 1838. However, the Cornwall Polytechnic Society was founded in 1833. Its hall now houses the Falmouth Arts Centre.<br><br><hr size=\"1\"<br><P>Sir Eric Richardson, who has died aged 101, was an exponent of polytechnic education who headed three institutions that have developed into universities - Salford, City and Westminster - and was a leader of 20th-century evangelical Christianity.<P>In 1957, he became head of the Regent Street Polytechnic, which since 1881 had brought education plus sport, social and spiritual activity to the less privileged of London, and now sought to cater for every need, whatever the level. It was the only UK institution embracing a school and a vast range of further education courses, as well as undergraduate, postgraduate and research work, but this was to count against it.<P>Although the volume of advanced work was greater than in many other similar places, the polytechnic was not designated as a college of advanced technology because of the non-advanced work, and so was not eligible for transfer to the university sector when that possibility arose in 1964. But Richardson grasped the nettle. Within three months he went to the Ministry of Education with a plan for expansion, only to be told to reduce his student intake, as provision was to be moved away from central London. He completely ignored this dictate.<P>By 1964, 70% of the polytechnic's work was advanced, and a few years later virtually all of it was. Subsequently, the Inner London Education Authority accepted Richardson's proposals, and a massive building programme commenced in 1966 to provide two new colleges - one to serve the professions of the construction industry, the other for engineering and science - plus a school of management studies and a tower block for student residences.<P>The polytechnic was ready for the next phase in the expansion of higher education, namely the polytechnics. Ironically, the government had chosen for its policy the very name of the institution which had brought the word \"polytechnic\" into English, but in 1969 the governors of the day were compelled to rename it the Polytechnic of Central London, with Richardson as its first director. His tenure did not see it become a university, but he had focused its work on higher education while retaining its commitment to less privileged Londoners. When, in 1992, the next policy shift permitted, the Polytechnic of Central London was easily launched as the University of Westminster.<P>Born in Woodchurch, Birkenhead, Richardson, barely breathing and feeding badly, looked set to follow a brother who had died at seven months. In desperation, his mother took him to Rhyl, north Wales, where within weeks he was transformed and equipped with a constitution that was to last for a century. He attended Birkenhead higher elementary school and became a Methodist Sunday schoolteacher; he remained a devout Christian all his life.<P>While working as an apprentice in Liverpool, he attended evening classes at Birkenhead Technical College and Liverpool Technical College, obtaining his ONC, HNC and matriculation. With a Birkenhead scholarship and support from local Methodists, he was able both to enter Liverpool University and continue to support his family: he took a first-class BEng degree in 1931 and a PhD in 1933. His academic career began at Hull Municipal College, as chief lecturer (1933-37) and head of electrical engineering (1937-41). He moved to be principal of Oldham Municipal Tech-nical College (1942-44) and of the Royal Technical College Salford, now Salford University (1944-47).<P>Richardson was then invited to became principal of what was then Northampton Polytechnic, so named from its location in Northampton Square, London EC1, and is now City University. He had married his wife May in 1941, and part of the motivation for moving to the capital was access to Great Ormond Street children's hospital for their daughter Sheila, who sadly died while under treatment. A decade later he took up the challenge of Regent Street.<P>Richardson held many professional offices, becoming president of the Association of Principals of Technical Institutions in 1962, the year he was made a CBE. He was particularly amused by his appointment as chairman of the General Optical Council; they wanted to avoid anyone with specialist knowledge. He served for 21 years on the advisory committee on colonial colleges of arts, science and technology - he was particularly associated with the development of higher education in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya - and was knighted in 1967.<P>His Christian commitment mirrored his professional life, in Africa as chairman of the African Evangelical Fellowship (1950-70), and in visiting hospitals and homes of the Leprosy Mission, of which he was a council member from 1970 and subsequently chairman (1974-84). His involvement with youth was reflected in posts with the National Young Life Campaign, the Crusaders Union and the University and Colleges Christian Fellowship. He was a trustee from 1966 of the Evangelical Trust and its chairman from 1989 to 1999. For the London School of Theology, he acted as chairman (1970-77) and president (1978-90). He leaves May and his three surviving children, David, Rosalyn and Anne.<P><b>&#183;</b> John Eric Richardson, electrical engineer, academic and administrator, born June 30 1905; died July 20 2006"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/aug/15/guardianobituaries.highereducation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/news/2006/aug/15/guardianobituaries.highereducation","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"How to help the poor in the developing world","webPublicationDate":"2006-08-08T09:14:54Z","sectionId":"travel","id":"travel/2006/aug/08/budgetingforyourholiday.ethicalfinances.internationalaidanddevelopment","fields":{"body":"<p>The beach is perfect, the sunset just right, the drinks perfectly cooled and then a small hand taps at your side. Beggars, and in particular child beggars, are a sad reality of any travel outside the first world.</p><p>They immediately present an ethical dilemma: what is the best way to help them? Do you opt for the give nothing strategy, or do you give a little - or even a lot?</p><p>Francesca Leadlay, information officer at UK charity <a href=\"http://www.tourismconcern.org.uk\">Tourism Concern</a>, is in the don't-give camp: \"Tourism Concern believes that giving to children encourages begging,\" she says. \"'One school pen' is the chorus of children in many developing countries where tourists have dished out pens like trinkets.\"</p><p>But David Else, a writer for guidebook publisher Lonely Planet and a specialist in Africa, thinks differently. \"Giving to beggars is a matter of choice,\" he says, picking his words carefully, \"and it needs to be a responsible choice.\"</p><p>He believes that visitors should decide whether to give based on local factors. \"In many developing countries begging and giving is part of the local culture,\" he points out. \"And where it is, I think it's OK to give money and I think tourists should give money.\" His advice is to watch the locals: \"If people are giving loose change, there's your answer.\"</p><p>However, he adds, \"When it's patently not part of the local culture - kids on the beach in Kenya, Goa or Cambodia - then you need to question it. Are they begging because the tourists are there?</p><p>He also warns that the money may not be going straight into the child's pocket. \"There are Fagin-type characters who control the children, or often it's the parents who send them out to beg,\" he says.</p><p><strong>Third world ways</strong><br /> Tourism Concern suggests there are other ways you can make a difference without negotiating the murky area of giving to child beggars. \"You can make a positive difference as a tourist and avoid guilt trips by taking simple steps such as staying in locally-owned accommodation, buying locally and paying a fair price,\" says Leadlay.</p><p>Else agrees: \"When you don't want to give directly you have two choices. Give to a local charity, or, if you can't do that, give to a charity at home.\"</p><p>Carl Wootten did exactly that. The 23-year-old is a music technology student at Bath University who spent a gap year in 2002 teaching Aids awareness at a secondary school in Tanzania. When he came home, he tried to find something that could help people in similar situations to those he had met.</p><p>\"After looking around, I found Plan, which helps children directly. I started sponsoring 12-year-old Shetrick in Kenya, which is not that far from Tanzania.\"</p><p>According to the child sponsorship information website <a href=\"http://www.dontbuyicecream.com\">www.dontbuyicecream.com</a>, there are 28 charities in the UK that are involved in directly sponsoring children overseas. All of them have similar procedures which allow UK supporters to sponsor a child in the developing world for &#163;10-&#163;25 a month and, in return, receive regular updates on the child's progress - as well as the feeling of being directly involved.</p><p>The biggest of the charities involved is <a href=\"http://www.plan-uk.org\">Plan UK</a>, which was founded in 1937 by journalist John Langdon Davies after he worked as a reporter during the Spanish Civil War. His slogan at the time was that a British \"foster parent\" could support a child refugee in Spain on one shilling a day.</p><p>Now Plan International operates the biggest scheme in the world, sponsoring over 1 million children worldwide. \"We have 119,000 sponsors in the UK,\" says press officer Sandra Brobbey. \"We have one woman who sponsors 12 children.\"</p><p><strong>Bread tape</strong><br /> So how does it work in practice? With Plan the monthly commitment is &#163;12. When you first apply, your name is run through a police check before the charity links you with a child in a country of your choice. You are then invited to write three or four letters a year, perhaps even send appropriate gifts to the child, who - with the help of a local charity officer - will write back.</p><p>The process is quite involved, with \"safety checks\" along the way. \"All letters come first to the Plan UK office,\" explains Brobbey. They are checked for appropriate content before being sent on to the Plan office in the field, which then distributes the letters.</p><p>The scheme is organised on the basis of one child, one sponsor. Although the money you donate goes towards projects in the child's community rather than directly to the child or family, the children are definitely real and not simply representatives of their village.</p><p>Your commitment to sponsoring a child is expected to be a minimum of three years. Many sponsors support \"their\" child for a decade, and some even visit them in their home country. \"We coordinate hundreds of sponsor visits a year,\" explains Brobbey.</p><p>Rosemary Wickham, 66, is a retired occupational therapist. She started sponsoring 14-year-old Yustin-Lindaly in Honduras four years ago and went to visit her in February this year.</p><p>\"It was lovely to meet them all,\" she says. \"I was shown the school that Plan had built and sat down for a meal with Yustin-Lindaly, her mum and brothers and sisters.</p><p>\"I took some gifts including a football for her brothers, some crayons for her sister and a tea towel and calendar with pictures of Bristol on for her mum.</p><p>\"The personal contact you get from sponsorship is really good and the visit showed what the money is being spent on.\"</p><p><strong>Global villages</strong><br /> However, it is exactly this personal contact that makes other, larger charities shy away from such schemes. Oxfam, for example, says, \"Helping individual children can also cause inequality between brothers and sisters or between friends, which can lead to further problems. Additionally, it is expensive to keep up a flow of specific information and photographs between each child and their sponsor.\"</p><p>Instead Oxfam has developed a wider sponsorship scheme. Through the charity's Life programme, you can sponsor a whole village.</p><p>Malambo is a Maasai village in Tanzania. Four people from Malambo have been chosen to represent the village in all Oxfam's promotional material. Emma Walsh manages the scheme: \"People want to follow the progress over the years and that's the main attraction. We have signed 2,000 sponsors and ask for a commitment of seven to 10 years.\"</p><p>Sponsorship money goes into a dedicated fund for the village and its surrounding area - about 22,000 people.</p><p>\"We're trying to boost their income generation through grants and loans to start up small businesses: for example, making beadwork crafts.\"</p><p>The charity even commissioned local women to make bead bracelets for the sponsor kits sent to UK donors. \"The result is women can pay for education and housing.\" Funds also go towards training teachers and ensuring water and food supplies.</p><p><strong>Under the carpet</strong><br /> At the other end of the scale from Oxfam and Plan is <a href=\"http://www.projectmala.org.uk\">Project Mala</a>. This small charity was founded 20 years ago to give child knotted-carpet workers in Uttar Pradesh, India, an education. The charity has 200 sponsors and supports 1,000 children in six schools.</p><p>\"They get breakfast, a midday meal, health checks and an education for about &#163;5-&#163;6 a month,\" explains Joan Worth, the charity's only salaried staff member.</p><p>Project Mala depends almost entirely on sponsors. \"It's good because once you've got a sponsor they stick with you,\" she says.</p><p>Unlike Plan, the charity doesn't allow sponsors to write or to visit. \"Not every child is sponsored so it could create a rift, and, anyway, everything is in Hindi. Sponsors get a report on the child every term - it's emailed directly from the school in India.\"</p><p>Worth thinks that these reports help explain the popularity of sponsorship schemes as a way of giving to charity. \"People like to know more,\" she explains.</p><p>And then there is the fact that the financial commitment the schemes involve is such a small one. \"It's &#163;9 a month,\" Worth says, of the Project Mala scheme. \"It's nothing really.\"</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/aug/08/budgetingforyourholiday.ethicalfinances.internationalaidanddevelopment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2006/aug/08/budgetingforyourholiday.ethicalfinances.internationalaidanddevelopment","sectionName":"Travel"},{"webTitle":"CNN takes a closer look at Africa","webPublicationDate":"2006-07-13T09:58:23Z","sectionId":"media","id":"media/2006/jul/13/broadcasting.tvnews","fields":{"body":"<p>CNN is to launch Eye on Africa, a new series described as a 'landmark moment' in the TV network's history.</p><p>The week-long season aims to redirect the media's focus on the continent to highlight \"emerging trends and the positive impact they are having on growth and development\".</p><p>Programmes in the series will be presented by some of CNN's most experienced journalists and feature guests such as Kofi Annan and Africa's first female president, Liberia's Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf.</p><p>Correspondents will report from across Africa, covering issues which affect the entire continent.</p><p>The week's programming begins on Sunday, July 16, with CNN connects in Soweto, a round-table discussion about modern South Africa and the state of the nation since the end of apartheid.</p><p>Where Have all the Parents Gone?, a documentary following the plight of Aids orphans in Kenya, will be hosted by Christiane Amanpour, CNN's chief international correspondent - will air on Wednesday July 19. </p><p>\"The media often gets criticised for not covering Africa.

Your students and staff have made a huge contribution over the last 175 years to our knowledge and well-being.<P>The College was co-founded by one of my predecessors at Downing Street, even though I'll accept that the Duke of Wellington is far more famous for battles won outside Parliament than within.<P>I am also the third Labour Prime Minister to be a Commemoration Orator after Clement Atlee and Harold Wilson. And of course, more recently in 2004 for your 175th anniversary, Desmond Tutu spoke.<P>It is about Africa, as well as the challenge of climate change, that I want to talk about tonight, and the progress we have made since the Gleneagles G8 Summit in July 2005.<P>We achieved at Gleneagles more than all, but those with the most rose-tinted spectacles, thought was possible. These issues were not high up the political agenda, in the UK, let alone internationally. Now they are.<P>That was in no small part down to the efforts of million of people mobilized by the Make Poverty History campaign and Live8.<P>But just because these issues are at the top of the agenda now, it doesn't mean they couldn't easily slip down again. I will do everything I can to ensure they don't. I hope you will too.<P><b>Achievements at Gleneagles</b><P>Let me recap what we actually achieved at Gleneagles.<P>Six months before the Gleneagles Summit, at the annual UN talks on climate change, in Buenos Aires, the EU and the US were at loggerheads simply about whether we could even talk about tackling climate change after 2012, when the first stage of Kyoto expired. In fact, climate change was not even on the agenda at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2003 in South Africa. <P>By making climate change a priority for Gleneagles, I wanted to re-start a more meaningful, more practical conversation between the key international players - the G8 plus five other major emerging economies. The aim was to get consensus that we needed urgent action to address climate change, to agree on practical actions we could take now - working with business and consumers - to reduce emissions, and to establish an ongoing dialogue with key countries on a strong international framework for after 2012.<P>We achieved all three of these objectives. We established a new consensus on the need for action which set the foundation for much more successful UN talks on climate change at the end of 2005 in Montreal, compared to the talks a year before in Buenos Aires. <P>The G8 agreed a wide ranging and very practical Plan of Action on measures we could take now to clean up the way we produce and the way we all use energy, and how to fund in particular developing countries to be able to access this clean technology too. And we established the Gleneagles Climate Change Dialogue, with 20 of the biggest energy using countries. <P>The next meeting of this group will be in Mexico in October to further drive forward the Gleneagles action plan, and to discuss the elements of a future international framework and the outcomes of the Stern review on the economics of climate change.<P>But we also achieved some practical action.<P><b>&#183;</b> The International Energy Agency has developed 4 practical energy efficiency proposals that we are discussing at St Petersburg<P><b>&#183;</b> The World Bank has pushed forward planning for an investment framework to lever billions of dollars to help poor countries get access to clean technology<P><b>&#183;</b> The EU, under our presidency, agreed to help build a demonstration clean coal power station with China<P><b>&#183;</b> The EU agreed a new initiative with India on renewable technology.<P>On Africa, I have learned two key lessons in the last 10 years, in Sierra Leone, in Rwanda, in Ethiopia and now in Sudan. Firstly, that everything is connected. There's no single solution. There's no point in providing health care if there's no clean water. People with an education also want skilled jobs. There's no point having oil if it only fuels corruption. So we need a comprehensive approach.<P>And secondly, I have seen that if there is real commitment by African governments to progress, then their people will do the rest. And that's why, now matter how desperate the situation looks or how insurmountable the obstacles appear, we can maintain hope that change is possible.<P>When I was in Ethiopia a year and a half ago, I visited a project in a village just outside Addis Ababa, called Debre Zeit, which helped children orphaned by AIDS. And it was clear there - as it has been each time I have visited Africa - that the people, every time, in no matter how small a way they were given the chance of a better future, they took it. So it has to be a partnership, a deal between developed countries and African governments.<P>That's why I wanted Gleneagles to bring the G8 and African leaders together to agree a detailed and comprehensive plan, which addressed the multiple causes of poverty, together and effectively.<P>That's why Bob Geldof, who is here tonight, and I established the Commission for Africa. The Commission published its report, 'Our Common Interest', in March 2005.<P>At Gleneagles, three months later, the G8 agreed with African leaders to implement over fifty of the detailed recommendations of the Commission for Africa. As well as agreeing to cancel debts and double aid for Africa, there were commitments on peace-keeping, on AIDS treatment, on free healthcare and primary education, on improving infrastructure and encouraging investment.<P>My main disappointment at Gleneagles was that we were not able to make more progress on trade. In a way, what was most frustrating, was that the leaders there all agreed that we needed a good outcome for developing countries from the Doha Round, but the negotiations are not reflecting this. <P>I have worked hard since Gleneagles to turn this political commitment into a real breakthrough in the negotiations, but we are not there yet. The coming month will be critical.<P>We need an ambitious pro development package that will help millions climb out of poverty and stimulate global growth. <P>This means further cuts in agricultural subsidies and significant market opening, as well as a deal on industrial goods and most importantly a package of measures for the poor countries that includes $4bn aid for trade, 100% market access and the power to choose their own economic and trade polices. <P>Everyone will have to move beyond their comfort zones. In the coming month I will work to try and make this happen. Failure would not only be a blow for the poor but the whole idea of multilateralism.<P>So, that was Gleneagles. Not everything we wanted. But I genuinely think it was the most that was ever likely to be achieved in the circumstances. <P>At the time, some people focused on the shortfalls. Some people just always do. Others recognised how much has been achieved. Kofi Annan called Gleneagles \"the greatest summit for Africa ever.\" But I think everyone agreed then, and still agree now, that the real test was yet to come. Would these promises be kept?<P>We are doing better than many would have predicted a year ago. But not - of course - fast enough on everything.<P><b>Next steps on climate change</b><P>On climate change, in the next 12 months we need to build a global consensus about the scale of the action we need to take, and the long-term goal we're all working towards. We need to begin agreement on a framework that the major players - US, China, India and Europe - buy into and has at its heart a goal to stabilise temperature and green house gas concentrations. <P>And we need to accelerate discussions - we can't take the 5 years it took Kyoto took to negotiate.<P>I believe a clear goal and a strong framework would help spur the technology revolution we need. It is vital to give business the certainty it needs to invest in cleaner technology and reduce emissions, so that they can produce the clean products consumers want to buy.<P>You need goals whether you are planning a government programme for developing technologies or setting targets for the private sector. I happen to believe in such targets because I have seen them work. The EU emissions trading scheme has already been shown to be an incredibly powerful incentive for private sector action, involving around 12,000 installations across 25 countries. <P>This market is already estimated to be worth 5.4 billion. And the investment decisions that are being made now, both within Europe and across the world, will determine what happens to global emissions in the next 15-20 years. But this also need to go further. <P>That's why, within the EU, I believe we need to give a clear, strong signal to business that the emissions trading scheme should be extended and strengthened, after 2012 and made the heart of a global carbon market.<P>We also need more investment in research into cleaner technology, to bring that technology from design to manufacture, and to enable it to be used by households in both developed and developing countries. The OECD already estimates that the market for cleaner investment in developing countries through the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism is worth about $10billion. But we know this won't be enough on its own. And we will need stronger action to help the poorest countries adapt to climate change, both now and in the future.<P>Finally, we need to back all this up with real action to reduce UK domestic emissions. The UK has already reached its target under the Kyoto Protocol, 7 years ahead of schedule. We will be doing twice as much as we have to by 2012. A track record very few can better.<P>Regarding our much more ambitious 20% target on CO2 we are getting closer but are not there yet. The energy review will be critical in setting out new measures to help us go further, including on renewables and energy efficiency.<P>We also need to recognise that taking action on climate change is not just a matter for Governments. Yes, Government needs to give a lead. But ultimately each of us also has a responsibility to act in our daily lives. In the choices we make - whether it's in the energy we use at home, or how we move around - we also can each make a contribution towards tackling this global challenge.<P><b>Progress on Africa</b><P>And now Africa.<P>First of all, the numbers.<P>At Gleneagles, we agreed to double aid for Africa and increase total aid for all developing countries by $50bn a year, from $80bn in 2004 to $130bn by 2010.<P>In 2005, aid increased to over $105bn. It was a huge leap - over half way to the 2010 target.<P>Yes, its true, a lot of this increase in the figures resulted from debt cancellation for Iraq and Nigeria. We know that this means that - for some - there is a real challenge to ensure aid figures don't fall again in 2007 or 2008. But we are facing up to that challenge.<P>DFID increased aid to Africa by 22% last year, to over &#163;1 billion for the first time ever. The UK has increased aid by 140% in real terms since 1997.<P>We are also taking forward various innovative financing mechanisms to ensure that aid is increased as quickly as possible. Along with a number of other countries, Gordon Brown has launched the International Finance Facility for Immunisation. It will frontload $4 billion of aid to help save five million children's lives before 2015. <P>The first bonds will go on sale this year. Solidarity contributions on airline tickets are another innovative way to help deliver more aid - the UK already has an Air Passenger Duty. And with France in particular, we are developing an International Drug Purchase Facility designed to lower the cost and improve the availability of drugs for HIV and AIDS and malaria.<P>We are not apologetic about increasing debt relief. Debt relief brings real benefits to developing countries. NGOs campaigned for Nigeria's debts to be cancelled. The UK worked hard with Nigeria to find a solution. Nigeria is now developing poverty reduction programmes that will be funded from the annual savings of at least US$1 billion, employing an extra 120,000 teachers and sending 3.5 million children to school.<P>In addition, the G8 - thanks to the work of Gordon Brown - agreed to cancel 100% of the multilateral debts of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries. This could amount to a total of $50 billion of relief. 14 African countries have already benefited from cancellation of their debts to the IMF. <P>The World Bank and Africa Development Bank will cancel debts owed to them in July. A further 18 African countries could benefit once they have qualified under the HIPC initiative, which is to ensure that the resources released by debt relief go to benefit poor people. Zambia has already used the resources released from this debt relief to make health care free for all people in rural areas.<P>These increased resources should help us invest above all in better health and education for poor people in developing countries - and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals to get all kids into primary school, to cut infant and maternal mortality rates and to tackle infectious diseases.<P>The Polio Eradication Initiative is on-track to end polio transmission in all countries except Nigeria by the end of 2006 though extra international funding is still needed to eradicate polio fully.<P>It is 25 years since AIDS was discovered. And for the first time we have in place the means to begin to reverse the AIDS epidemic. 8 times as many Africans are on treatment now as 3 years ago - but still only 1 in 5 who need it, get it.<P>The G8 agreed that we should aim to provide universal treatment for all AIDS sufferers by 2010. The UN has now agreed that every developing country should produce a plan for delivering on this promise and that no good plan should go unfunded.<P>On corruption, we have ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption which came into force in December. We are taking action to enforce this. We are implementing the recommendation of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Africa, to set up a dedicated unit - joining up the Met and City of London Police, with other key agencies and departments - to deal with international corruption, and ensure that allegations of bribery and money laundering are properly investigated.<P>On peace and security, over 20,000 peacekeeping troops have been trained since the 2004 G8 pledge to train 75,000 by 2010. We have been training Rwandan troops, in Kenya, who are now protecting refugees in Darfur.<P>Ever since the UK sent a relatively small force to Sierra Leone in 2000, and helped to end the civil war, I have been sure that if Africa had its own ability to respond rapidly to conflicts as they broke out, then many of the long, protracted conflicts we have seen on the continent could be avoided. <P>The new African Union has embraced this doctrine of \"non-indifference\" and has now established a Stand By Force to do just this. We will help it to achieve full capability by 2010. AU forces have already made a difference in Darfur, under the most difficult circumstances, and have provided a good base for the planned UN mission to build on. <P>But the difficulty we had in getting the mission underway shows the urgent need for such a Stand By Force. The EU has agreed 300 million for the Africa Peace Facility for 2008-2010 to support these efforts further.<P>And finally, there is some good news on Africa's economy. Last month's IMF World Economic Outlook showed that Africa's economy is growing faster than the global average. It said that \"growth in excess of 7 percent in Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone reflects the continuing positive effects of earlier reforms...\" and that \"the economic outlook in sub-Saharan Africa remains positive, with growth of 5.8 percent projected this year - the highest rate in over 30 years - underpinned by high commodity prices, improved macroeconomic policies, and structural reforms...\"<P>We are also investing in Africa's economy. At Gleneagles, we pledged to support the AU/NEPAD Investment Climate Facility. This was launched in Cape Town a month ago with about $100m of initial capital from four multinational companies, 3 governments and two international organisations. We also pledged to build an international infrastructure consortium to increase investment in the infrastructure which business in Africa is crying out for. <P>We launched this in October. In its first year, consortium members secured funding for ten regional projects worth $700 million and 34 country projects worth US$1.8 billion. And they have agreed scoping studies that will lead to further rounds of new infrastructure projects.<P><b>Next steps on Africa</b><P>So, very real progress has been made in the last 12 months, which will make a real difference to peoples lives. What next?<P>The Government will shortly be publishing a new White Paper on Eliminating World Poverty which will set out what we need to do in the next ten years to ensure that we deliver on Gleneagles and get Africa back on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals. We can't be complacent or underestimate the action required.<P>At the St Petersburg G8 Summit, leaders will reaffirm their commitment to the Gleneagles promises, review progress and focus on further steps we can take, particularly on health and education.<P>Let me focus on health and education for a moment, therefore. The G8 has promised to help developing countries fund free healthcare and primary education for all. The challenge now is for developing countries to draw up ambitious plans for health and education and for the G8 to provide the long-term predictable funding required.<P>To encourage developing countries to do this, the UK is taking the lead.<P>In April, Gordon Brown and Hilary Benn, announced that the UK would provide &#163;8.5bn over the next ten years to fund long-term education plans.<P>In order to deliver on this, I can announce tonight that DFID's budget for education will more than double to over &#163;1 billion a year by 2010, up from about &#163;450 million last year.<P>Alongside funding from others, this will help to give at least 22 developing countries the predictable funding they need to invest in ambitious long-term strategies to get all children into school by 2015.<P>And, as we get closer to getting all children into primary school, the demand will increase for secondary and higher education. This is crucial to skill people in developing countries to work in a growing economy and to be the teachers, doctors and nurses which are needed to provide health and education for the next generation.<P>In our forthcoming White Paper, the Government will set out how we will increase our support for post-primary education, to underpin economic growth, good governance and public services.<P>We also need to provide developing countries with long-term, predictable funding for 10 year health plans, to provide free basic health care and universal access to AIDS treatment. Save the Children have estimated that making health care free for all could save nearly 300,000 kids' lives in Africa every year.<P>We will be working with developing countries, NGOs and other partners to produce 10 year health and education plans and to secure the funding for them. No good plans should go unfunded. This will require a joint effort by all donors, to implement the commitments made at Gleneagles and at the UN Millennium Summit.<P>At St Petersburg, we will discuss the launch of a pilot Advance Market Commitment - to stimulate research and development into vaccines for killer disease.<P>But, looking ahead, we can't just focus on health and education. We need to deliver the comprehensive package agreed at Gleneagles.<P>At Gleneagles, the G8 agreed that the existing Africa Partnership Forum should be strengthened to monitor implementation. The UK and other donors are funding the establishment of a Support Unit to help the APF carry out its monitoring mandate.<P>The Commission for Africa recommended the establishment of an independent mechanism to monitor and report on progress. In the year since then, it has become more necessary not less.<P>Working with Bob Geldof, who was also on the Commission for Africa, I have therefore decided to convene a Panel of world leaders from all sectors to ensure that our promises to Africa are kept.<P>It will be called the Africa Progress Panel. It will encourage and measure progress, against the commitments made to and by Africa at G8 and UN Summits, notably Gleneagles, towards the achievement of the Millennium Development goals, and will maintain the international political profile of Africa, achieved in 2005.<P>The Panel will produce an annual report that will be submitted to the G8, UN and the African Partnership Forum. I will meet the panel regularly to hear from them.<P>Conclusion - we will succeed if we keep Africa and Climate Change at the top of the international agenda<P>I want to finish by saying that there is a role for everybody -everybody in this room and everybody outside this room - in making sure that the promises made in Gleneagles are delivered.<P>Kofi Annan, has agreed to chair it. He has worked tirelessly for Africa as UN Secretary General for the last 10 years, and before that within the UN. No-one understands the challenges better.<P>We will be ready to introduce the whole Panel in the next few weeks but today I can say as well as Bob and Kofi, President Obasanjo of Nigeria and Peter Eigen, the founder of Transparency International have agreed to be on it. Bill Gates has also kindly agreed to help fund it. for years to come to eliminate poverty in Africa and tackle climate change.<P>But I believe that if we do implement the ambitious agreements on climate change and Africa agreed at Gleneagles, and if we do this with all of the G8 and the EU and China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and Africa, and if we do reform the UN and the rest of the international system, and if we work with business and civil society partners, and if we mobilise public support, then we can hope to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to start to cut the levels of carbon in the atmosphere to the levels necessary to avoid dangerous climate change.<P>It will take hard work by governments and for this we need your political support. I have already mentioned the importance of the Make Poverty History campaign and the Live8 concerts last year. We need that sort of public support year in year out, in every country, if we are to end poverty and stop climate change.<P>It's a huge challenge. Together, we can succeed."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jun/26/development.uk1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2006/jun/26/development.uk1","sectionName":"Politics"},{"webTitle":"Luxury without the guilt","webPublicationDate":"2006-05-14T17:24:25Z","sectionId":"travel","id":"travel/2006/may/14/ecotourism.observerescapesection","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>1 Dubai - Al Maha</strong></p><p>The Emirates Al Maha Desert Resort is unadulterated opulence.

The lake, also known as Lake Malawi, is the third-biggest in Africa, at 560km long, and has more garishly-hued fish (1,000 species) swimming around in its gin-clear fresh water than any other inland body of water on earth.</p><p>Mozambique is recovering after 40 years of civil war and, in Lake Nyasa's most gorgeous corner, Nkwichi Lodge and the Manda Wilderness project have together assumed a prominent role in the country's tourism renaissance.</p><p>Nkwichi Lodge was built using sustainable local materials in a faintly Flintstones-esque style, with boulders and branches protruding into rooms and four-posters fashioned from chunky logs. Which is not to say it lacks elegance or comfort: there are just seven secluded chalets, each with its own outdoor en suite, where you shower under the stars or with a view of the lake. Fourteen surrounding villages have set up the 100,000-hectare community-owned reserve, where wildlife populations decimated during the wars are now reviving.</p><p><strong>Green highlights</strong></p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>To encourage the return of big game, surrounding communities have agreed to stop cutting and burning the forest and hunting with snares and dogs.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Nkwichi is the biggest local employer and provides training in tourism.

The restoration of the building began in 1990, when the British-owned travel company Discover purchased the decrepit shell and turned it into a luxury boutique hotel, renowned for having some of the best views in north Africa.</p><p>The rooms are unabashedly luxurious - and the food rates with the best in Morocco. You can sip mint tea on a rooftop terrace and soak up the views of Jebel Toubkal, North Africa's highest mountain, or soak in the steamy decadence of the hammam, a Turkish bath.</p><p>The restoration was a joint venture with the Berber people of the Imlil valley. It used local labour and traditional methods wherever possible - not that there was a choice, since access was by mule and electricity didn't arrive until 1997. It's now run by staff from the surrounding villages, who bring traditional Berber hospitality to their guests.</p><p><strong>Green highlights</strong></p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Funding from the Kasbah has supported a waste management system and environmentally appropriate incinerators for surrounding villages.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>The Kasbah employs hotel staff, guides, porters and other tradespeople from the Ait Mizane tribe in the surrounding valley.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Discover bought an ambulance for Imlil.

Until a decade ago, the local wildlife was diminishing at a rapid rate and virtually no one in the local community had a job.</p><p>The safari camp operator Wilderness Safaris joined forces with the local Riemvasmaker people and aid and conservation organisations to establish Damaraland Camp as a blueprint for community tourism projects. Around 350,000 hectares are now under protection, wildlife numbers are thriving and the local people have training and incomes, and are actively engaged in managing the land and wildlife.</p><p>Ten luxury tents squat rather insignificantly amid a landscape of vast views and enormous plains edging up to huge mountains. The daily camp routine usually involves game drives and nature walks where the Damaraland guides breathe life into the arid landscape, explaining the intricate adaptations of desert dwellers, from the tiniest insect to the black rhinoceros, desert elephant, oryx, and kudu.</p><p><strong>Green highlights</strong></p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Many of the animal populations have doubled since 1996, when the project was established, and where wildlife was once seen as a threat, it is now regarded as an important economic asset.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Damaraland Camp won the overall 2005 Tourism for Tomorrow Conservation award.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Ten per cent of room revenues are returned to the community to fund the local school, stock loss compensation programmes and other projects.</p><p><strong>Getting there</strong></p><p>Prices start from &pound;2,038 per person for a two-week stay based on two people sharing, including return flights from London.

Along with the corals and a myriad of reef fish, the guided snorkelling excursions normally encounter turtles and dolphins and many other creatures that would generally go unnoticed without the eagle-eyed guides. Visitors can stay in the delightfully romantic eco-villa, built in traditional Swahili style using materials from local suppliers.</p><p>Rainfall is stored in huge holding tanks underneath each unit, then pumped to a tank on the roof where it is solar heated for showers. Lighting comes from solar power, grey water is filtered and used for irrigation, and the toilets are of the non-smelly compost variety. All this really means is guilt-free afternoon siestas, either on the beach or in your own private hammock.</p><p><strong>Green highlights</strong></p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Each building on the island is completely self-sustaining and has virtually no adverse impact on the environment. The coral park protects a pristine coral island ecosystem in an area that is otherwise heavily overexploited.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Chumbe is staffed and managed by local people from nearby fishing villages on Zanzibar. The lodge funds an education programme where children from schools on Zanzibar are brought to the island to spend a day learning about coral reefs and the need for their conservation.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Profits from the lodge are reinvested directly into the island's education, conservation and research programmes.</p><p><strong>Getting there</strong></p><p>Seven nights in Zanzibar costs from &pound;1,195 per person with Rainbow Tours (0207 226 1004; <a href=\"http://www.rainbowtours.co.uk\">www.rainbowtours.co.uk</a>), including three nights at Chumbe Island Lodge, three at Matemwe Bungalows; and one at Tembo House Hotel including flights and transfers.</p><p><strong>6 Australia - Kooljaman</strong></p><p>A gruelling three-hour drive along dirt roads north of Broome on Australia's north-west coast, Cape Leveque ranks with the most isolated - and jaw-droppingly beautiful - spots on earth. Kooljaman is a wilderness camp offering accommodation ranging from traditional palm-frond shelters to sophisticated safari-style tents, set high on the hill with spectacular views, comfortable beds, kitchenette, balcony with barbecue and an en suite bathroom.</p><p>It is owned jointly by Aboriginals from the local One Arm Point and Djarindjin communities. Between July and October, migrating humpback whales put on a display in viewing distance of the deserted beaches.</p><p>And when you tire of the astonishing daytime colours, wait for sunset and moonrise, when the entire landscape is suddenly steeped in violet and vermilion.</p><p><strong>Green highlights</strong></p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>All members of the One Arm Point and Djarindjin communities are shareholders in Kooljaman.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>The construction of Kooljaman follows low-impact environmental guidelines. Its ongoing conservation projects include tree planting, recycling and the construction of boardwalks to protect the sand dunes.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>All profits go back to the community, and Kooljaman is nearly self-sufficient.</p><p><strong>Getting there</strong></p><p>Travelbag (0800 082 5000; <a href=\"http://www.travelbag.co.uk\">www.travelbag.co.uk</a>) offers a 'Call of the Wild' package to Kooljaman starting at &pound;759 per person for six nights, including return flights from Perth to Broome but not air travel from the UK to Perth.</p><p><strong>7 Romania - Danube Delta</strong></p><p>Some 2,860 kilometres from its origins in Germany's Black Forest, the Danube comes to a wild and isolated end. As it approaches Romania's Black Sea coast and the edge of Europe, the river breaks into three main branches to form the continent's second biggest delta (after the Volga), an environment of such variety and richness that Unesco has declared it a Natural World Heritage site.</p><p>There are 45 species of fish, 1,150 species of plant and 300 species of bird; plus tropical woods, pastures, sand dunes, subtropical forests and, spreading over almost a quarter of a million hectares, one of the world's largest reed beds. Opened last year, the five-star Delta Nature Resort on Lake Samova has 30 cabins built in the style of the local fishing villages. Rangers, naturalists and botanists will take boat safaris into the delta and there are kayaks and canoes for individual use.</p><p><strong>Green highlights</strong></p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>As a Unesco Natural World Heritage site, the Danube Delta is environmentally policed. Access to sensitive areas is limited and most forms of transport are relatively low impact.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>The resort is built with local wood and stone, food is locally sourced, and boat tours are designed not to disturb bird life.</p><p><strong>Getting there</strong></p><p>Prices start from &pound;105 per person per night. Road transfers from Bucharest can be arranged by the resort at a cost of &pound;123 per person.

There are serious rapids here, but you can alwas walk around the rapids: two hours through virgin rainforest.</p><p>Rafting the Fu involves two nights of luxury camping (complete with improvised sauna) on a riverside beach over three days. The river flows through stunning wilderness - valleys, canyons and rainforest - which would otherwise be completely inaccessible.</p><p><strong>Green highlights</strong></p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>The guides follow a minimum-impact policy at the camp site.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>$10 from the price of your trip cost goes to a local conservation group, Futafriends, which is campaigning to prevent the construction of a series of proposed dams on the river. Futafriends supports Chilean groups working to develop responsible tourism, small-scale agriculture and increased opportunities for the local community.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Local people are now seeing the value of tourism, which provides direct cash benefits, over hydro schemes (which benefit distant shareholders) and are becoming more forcefully opposed to the dams.</p><p><strong>Getting there</strong></p><p>Mountain Travel Sobek (01494 448901; <a href=\"http://www.mtsobek.com\">www.mtsobek.com</a>) offers nine-day packages from &pound;1,700 per person including internal flights from Santiago and all activities. These include easy to moderate daily hikes, three days' white water rafting and optional mountain biking. Accommodation is in lodges and hotels for six nights, with two nights of de luxe camping. The price does not include international flights.</p><p><strong>9 Ecuador - Kapawi</strong></p><p>Until the early Seventies the Achuar people were almost unknown to the Western world. Unlike many of the Amazon's indigenous groups, they have since been able to grow in numbers and thrive, while maintaining the bulk of their traditions (headhunting being a notable exception). They are also part owners of the Kapawi Ecolodge and Reserve, tucked away in the Ecuadorian Amazon, close to the Peruvian border.</p><p>The lodge was built using the Achuar concept of architecture - not a single nail was used in the construction - and offers guests a range of activities such as walking in the forest with tribesmen, bird-watching, canoeing and fishing trips, and visits to local villages.</p><p>Yet what really separates this from many of the Amazon's other 'ecolodges' is the unique nature of the partnership between the Achuar and the local tour company, Canodros. Canodros pays the Achuar a significant annual rental and a share of the profits. It is also training the Achuar with the aim of handing over the entire operation to them in 2011.</p><p><strong>Green highlights</strong></p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>The Kapawi Ecolodge was developed in part to show indigenous communities that they have economic options other than oil exploration, logging and cattle ranching.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>The Achuar see direct financial benefits through their shares in the company and the rental paid to them by Canodros. Kapawi also buys products and services for the lodge in the nearby communities.</p><p><strong>Getting there</strong></p><p>Journey Latin America (020 8747 8315; <a href=\"http://www.journeylatinamerica.co.uk\">www.journeylatinamerica.co.uk</a>) offers a four-night package from &pound;663 including accommodation, full board and transfers.</p><p><strong>10 Tonga - Vava'u</strong></p><p>The islands of Vava'u in Tonga are a humpback whale nursery. Every year between August and October, several hundred humpbacks migrate from Antarctica to the warm waters here to breed and give birth to young. Here, rather than just watching the whales from a boat, you can get into the water and swim alongside them - without doubt one of the most awesome wildlife experiences you will ever have.</p><p>Some conservation groups have raised concerns about whether swimming with whales is detrimental to their wellbeing, but there is a strong pro-whaling lobby in Tonga - hunting them was only banned in 1978 when the humpbacks were almost extinct - and if the income from whale-watching were to dry up, hunting might again become a serious threat.</p><p>The operator, Whaleswim, runs trips lasting from three to 10 days, staying on shore in traditional fales (wooden houses) with en suite bathrooms, double beds and mosquito nets.</p><p><strong>Green highlights</strong></p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Whaleswim donates 10 per cent of the profits of each booking to whale-protection organisations.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Tourism is not well developed in Tonga and the fledgling whale-watching industry provides employment and a much- needed economic boost for the country.</p><p><strong>Getting there</strong></p><p>A nine-day tour, including seven days swimming with whales, costs from &pound;1,456, excluding flights.

One answer is to offset the emissions by paying money to a company which will invest it in energy saving and green technology projects around the world.

This death toll falls disproportionately on women and children, who spend a lot of their time near fires. Indeed, more than half of the victims are children under the age of five. A third are women. If we are to achieve the UN millennium development goals by 2015, then every day for for the next 10 years 485,000 people will need to gain access to cleaner fuels.</p><p>The international community largely ignores indoor air pollution. Many people still do not appreciate the magnitude of the problem, and the sources and effects of the pollution fall under the jurisdiction of multiple government ministries, including health, energy and environment. As a result, household energy and health is often neglected, and it is difficult to highlight universally applicable solutions to attract donors.</p><p>But urgent action must be taken on this type of pollution and its adverse health effects. As the UN commission on sustainable development meets this week in New York to assess progress on energy-related development issues, delegates have a real chance to commit to programmes that address this public health crisis.</p><p>Fortunately, there are solutions. Cooking stoves that require far less fuel and emit far less smoke are readily available. Smoke hoods and simple chimneys would also improve indoor air quality. Cleaner fuels such as kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and biogas have the greatest potential to improve health.</p><p>High cost and inaccessibility prevent poor people from utilising cleaner fuels and new technologies. Multilateral organisations should work with the private sector and national and local governments to improve LPG distribution chains. They should also work with microfinance institutions to offer loans to help offset initial investments in improved technology.</p><p>In Britain, Practical Action, a Rugby-based group, has identified a set of low-cost solutions to reduce indoor smoke in communities in Kenya, Nepal and Sudan. With funding from the Department for International Development and support from the University of Liverpool and the WHO, they are now evaluating the impacts on health and family livelihoods.</p><p>While UN delegates at the commission on sustainable development may touch on indoor air pollution this week, the attention the issue receives is unlikely to be proportional to its adverse impact on public health. But by promoting cleaner fuels and improved technologies, the international community can help 3 billion poor people across the globe to lead longer and healthier lives.</p><p><strong>&amp;#183</strong> Erik Wurster, a graduate student at Harvard University's John F Kennedy school of government, is co-author of this article with Eva Rehfuess, a scientist with the WHO.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/may/10/internationalaidanddevelopment.comment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2006/may/10/internationalaidanddevelopment.comment","sectionName":"Society"},{"webTitle":"Ones that got away","webPublicationDate":"2006-05-05T10:03:00Z","sectionId":"film","id":"books/2006/may/05/filmadaptations6","fields":{"body":"<p>There are the great unfilmables you think won't work because their language resists translation to the screen: Joyce's Ulysses springs to mind. There are the classic adaptations you so wish had made it: Lean's Nostromo, Pinter's Proust, Godard's Voyage au Bout de la Nuit. And then there are the modern books you know would make good films, but have yet to appear. One such, for me, is Martin Amis's Money, which, of course, is partly about the hoops of film development the novel itself has gone through.</p><p>For Amis, the great chance was lost about 15 years ago. \"Gary Oldman seemed poised to play John Self and then it all fell through,\" he says. \"I saw Gary a couple of times and his grasp of the character was almost terrifying. The first thing he said to me was, 'I've got a great new cough.'\"</p><p>Perhaps Amis recognised in Oldman's remark something of himself; it certainly seems the kind of sentence he could have written. That union of sensibility between author and film-makers is what creates great adaptations, and Amis is still wistful about the possibility. \"After that, I felt the moment had gone, but who knows...\"</p><p>The good news is that another Amis novel in a similar mould, London Fields, remains a goer, with David Cronenberg attached to direct. \"It's still a possibility,\" Cronenberg said in March. \"It's a project I'm interested in. It's sort of on a back burner, I would say. It's about third in line.\"</p><p>What usually pushes optioned books down the line in the development process are questions of budget: cast size, location, period and so on. And waiting for big stars to come on board. Or the film-maker is waiting for the right interpretation. Or, as with Lord of the Rings, the appropriate technology.</p><p>Sometimes it's a question of the author holding on to the rights, as is an author's prerogative. I doubt we'll see The Catcher in the Rye till it's in the public domain, though the rumour is that Fox Searchlight is working on it hush-hush, with Terence Malik set to direct. Probably a canard, but you never know.</p><p>As for the great unfilmables, it turns out some of them have been filmed. Joseph Strick directed a version of Ulysses (1967), and Sean Walsh made a good fist of part of the story in Bloom (2003). Even Tristram Shandy - like Ulysses, a text so playful as to make any scriptwriter balk - was last year brought to the screen as A Cock and Bull Story, by Frank Cottrell Boyce and Michael Winterbottom.</p><p>With Tom Jones well in the can (1963), and a TV version made of Clarissa in 1991, the field is open for choicer cuts. My money is on Charlotte Bronte's weird and wonderful Villette. It was done for TV in 1970, but the great big-screen version has yet to materialise. The same goes for Ford's The Good Soldier. </p><p>Some works from the Victorian period that might lend themselves well to film treatment are not novels, but long poems, such as Tennyson's In Memoriam and Clough's Amours de Voyage.</p><p>Of earlier long poems, there have already been several versions of Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner (including one by Melvyn Bragg and Ken Russell) and there are a couple of versions of Paradise Lost in development hell - where else?</p><p>The most famous recent case of a book that cries out to be adapted but hasn't been is Jonathan Coe's What a Carve Up, planned as a TV serial for 1996. The BBC had optioned in the year of publication (1994), Kevin Loader was going to produce, and about 600 pages of scripts were written - but the BBC2 drama budget was tight in 1996 and they only had room to do one big serial. It was a straight choice between Carve Up and Iain Banks's The Crow Road - which did indeed, as Coe acknowledges, \"make an excellent and popular serial\".</p><p>What a Carve Up went through two other option holders, one with a script by David Nobbs of Rising Damp fame, before it was picked up for radio by a bright producer called Lucy Armitage, who kept Nobbs on to write. The radio version was a great success and last year ITV announced that it wanted to transfer it to television with the same cast. As Coe ruefully recalls, \"Lucy stayed on as producer and poor old David did another tranche of scripts. We all thought this was a bit crazy, but at this stage, if we'd been asked to do it as a four-minute short after News at Ten, we would have found a way.\"</p><p>A week or two after Nobbs' compressed script was delivered, a new head of ITV came in and cancelled it. Armitage went back to the BBC, but they already had a big Thatcher-era drama in production: Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty.</p><p>Sometimes it is the size and scope of a novel that kills its chances. This was always the case with William Boyd's magisterial The New Confessions, which covers a whole life in the 20th century, and like Money has film-making as its subject. \"People have circled around The New Confessions for years,\" says Boyd, \"but its scale daunts them in the end.\"</p><p>While he's had personal success as a scriptwriter of other material, Boyd has also experienced frustration with An Ice Cream War, his WWI-set Africa story: \"In the mid-80s I wrote a film script based on my novel. Thames TV was going to put a million quid into the movie - a lot of money in those days. We had a great director (Gavin Miller) and had done 50% of the casting and location recces in Kenya. Suddenly Thames TV lost its franchise as the then Conservative government had decided in their wisdom to open up UK commercial TV franchises to competitive bidding. Thames went and with them went their million for An Ice Cream War. I blame Margaret Thatcher.\"</p><p>Speaking for myself, I blame Osama bin Laden. On September 11 2001 my agent was in New York, trying to sell a script of Zanzibar, a novel about earlier al-Qaida bombings in East Africa. He was actually looking out of the window discussing the novel with a producer when he saw the planes hit.</p><p>Coe, who's been through the wars more than most, has some wise advice. \"In the end, you just have to shrug your shoulders and move on.\" He's right. Books don't need the imprimatur of film.

Unfortunately it wasn't because I was troughing my way through a bucket of food but because I *splutter* had other work to do.</p><p>Anyway: I've missed two instalments so far - one seemingly very interesting discussion on Middle Eastern media, and a second from pointyhead <a href=\"http://www.mediacenter.org/content/7594.cfm\">Jeffrey Sachs</a>.</p><p>But what else is on the menu?</p><p>Now we're off to look at some voices from the African media and new media sphere.</p><p>Incidentally, each panel discussion is brought in with a slideshow of Reuters pictures, usually focusing on death, disease, famine, war etc - whatever's dramatic. What would they characterise the west with, I wonder?</p><p>Oop, I'm not the only one.</p><p>Wilfred Kiboro, an African news exec, gets riled up about the continued stereotyping of Africa. I've lived in Kenya all my life, he says, but I don't recognise the country you're describing. We have 55 different countries in Africa, hundreds of ethnic communities, but people turn up and talk about Africa as if they're talking about France, Luxembourg, Switzerland etc.</p><p>How's that for a stunning piece of prescience from me, eh? Chalk one up.</p><p>Ory Okolloh, a Kenyan blogger, comes in via satellite. Our concern is that our stories weren't being captured well by international media or domestic media - but rather than complain about the coverage we're not getting, I challenge people to tell their stories.</p><p>Matthew Buckland, Mail &amp; Guardian Online, echoes Wilfred's points and notes that people get paid to write stories at <a href=\"http://www.reporter.co.za\">Reporter.co.za</a>; there is a thriving online community, but there still is a problem with internet access.</p><p>The chair of this panel, Rachel Rawlins, points out that western media treats Zambia like a basket case - a failed state, at the bottom of the heap - and yet the second newspaper to go online in Africa was one in Zambia. We're talking about the way the (westernised media) world views other nations.</p><p>How much time and money should we spend on connectivity when there? Ory Okolloh calls it \"crap\" that we shouldn't spend money on one thing because we have other problems. Matthew Buckland: connectivity is vital - whenever George Bush or Tony Blair sneezes, the world's media is on it. In Rwanda, 800,000 people are killed and all we hear is tumbleweed rolling down the corridor. If people are connected, they can get the message out.</p><p>David Dunkley Gyimah comes along to explain exactly: give people the means, and they will report. He met TV reporters in Ghana who only had two cameras and one of them was seconded by the president. The answer? Give them the equipment, they can run things. Six videojournalists, he explains, ran an entire 24 hour news channel. It's an action point.</p><p>Now we're onto meat and potatoes stuff that I think quite a few people have been waiting for: all the talk about money. This panel (the penultimate one, thankgoodness) features Rafat Ali (paidContent), Sebastian Grigg (Goldman Sachs), Carolyn McCall (Guardian), Shoba Purushothaman (TheNewsMarket), Dave Sifry (Technorati) and Chris Ahearn (Reuters Media).</p><p>Stephanie Flanders, moderating the panel: what is the business model for all of this?</p><p>Carolyn McCall - the challenges are very well documented, how do you cope with change and with investing in that change? Chris Ahearn says it's much ado about nothing. There are plenty of ways you can make money; taxes (BBC), advertising or subscriptions. The new new media is the old old media in a different form. How does the audience help us tell a story better? People who create content will be paid over time.</p><p>Rafat Ali, you can make people change their mindset by making them blog as part of the job (HELLO!) or go the lower-risk way of helping blogs grow. The weakest link in the chain is the individual journalist: they have to become open. Try and work at one tenth of the cost of what you used to: do more work at less cost.</p><p>Who pays for the fact checkers, the lawyers, says Stephanie Flanders? Chris Ahearn says we piss away money on technologies that startups would scoff at. Carolyn McCall says 40% of a print operation's cost is on the physical process of printing. Shoba Purushothaman believes the cost of newsgathering is increasing fast, and they talk a lot about trust but does anyone apart from investors really care about trust? Getting global domination has never been cheaper, but retaining it has never been more expensive.</p><p>Sebastien Grigg points out how old many media businesses are, but nobody has any idea where we're headed. Investors don't have any certainty either, but this problem has been going for a number of years. Dave Sifry: the reality is that there's a lot of fear and uncertainty and questions about who will make money. He plays a video - \"Day of the Long Tail\" - about how consumers are now very powerful. Very droll, Dave. Look at the core trends that are unstoppable, he says: on one side, adoption of broadband and mobile continues to increase, and on the other the ease of tools to make people producers as well as consumers. Then he trots out a line from web wonks the Cluetrain Manifesto about \"consumers who eat content and crap cash\"... (but he doesn't attribute it).</p><p>Now come on - some nitty gritty people. How do you make money out of this stuff? Shoba says we don't need to - there are tons of people prepared to do it for free. Dave Sifry points to small groups of bloggers who federate and co-operate to create advertising networks. And, he notes, the indirect revenues - people using the net to show off their portfolios, get consulting jobs and build their own personal brands - is far bigger than traditional revenue, but unrecorded.</p><p>Carolyn McCall: there are issues with established brands, legal issues etceterararara. Rafat: you just have to get the story right.</p><p>This is quickly swerving off the original premise and back towards a general discussion about the value of blogs (yawn). It's certainly more invigorating than yesterday's snoozefest, but talk about making money has disappeared.</p><p>Questions from the audience: What do we do about advertising? People can steal stuff if they don't like the way they're being advertised to or sold to. Where is the thinking going?</p><p>Sebastien Goldman Sachs: advertising needs massive audiences. That's changing online, but not fast enough. Rafat Paidcontent: it's not necessarily a scale game; I don't need five times the audience. McCall: small audiences can be very valuable. Nods of agreement, but not from Goldman Sachs.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mbites.com\">Mike Butcher</a> wonders whether it's technology companies, not media companies who will really make money from the future. Middle-sized media firms could struggle, says Shoba - but everybody thinks they are in the media business these days.</p><p>Last word to Dave Sifry - I hope we can finally put to bed this whole discussion of journalist versus blogger. The audience, bored of hearing this argument time and time again, applauds.</p><p>Moving on, the final session of the afternoon is going to be a \"call to action\" from Media Center, who put the whole thing together. Apologies to the organisers, but I'm going off to see what else is going on outside. Thanks for reading.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/may/04/wemediadaytwoafternoonsess","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/organgrinder/2006/may/04/wemediadaytwoafternoonsess","sectionName":"Media"},{"webTitle":"Programmer for hire","webPublicationDate":"2006-03-30T11:10:32Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/askjack/2006/mar/30/programmerforhire","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>I am a software engineer graduate living in Kenya.

PhotoShop is expensive but you may know someone who has a copy, and will load the PDD files and save them in a more common format, such as JPeg. PDD is a layered format and files can become corrupted, so there are also programs designed to rescue valuable images. Examples include Advanced PSD Repair (<a href=\"http://www.psd-repair.com\">www.psd-repair.com</a>), which costs $149.95, and PhotoshopRecovery (<a href=\"http://www.officerecovery.com/photoshop/\">www.officerecovery.com/photoshop/</a>) which costs $99.</p><p>Because there are hundreds of image file formats, many programs will convert between them. The first ones to try are Irfan View (<a href=\"http://www.irfanview.com\">www.irfanview.com</a>), XnView and Nconvert (<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/4y64r\">http://tinyurl.com/4y64r</a>), and both are free for non-commercial use. These are still worth a go, but if Total Image Converter (<a href=\"http://www.coolutils.com/TotalImageConverter\">www.coolutils.com/TotalImageConverter</a>) can't read the files, I would not hold out too much hope. It could be quicker and easier to go back to the original images or have fresh prints made for rescanning.</p><p>In general, it's a good idea to avoid saving important data in proprietary file formats or formats supported only or mainly by one company. These have their uses, but it's always worth saving a back-up copy of a file in a different, widely supported format. For example, save a JPeg as well as a PDD or PSD file, save an RTF or HTML file as well as a DOC file in Microsoft Word, save a CSV file in a database, and so on. The internet answer to the image file format problem is PNG which stands for Portable Network Graphics or, recursively, PNG's Not GIF (<a href=\"http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/\">www.libpng.org/pub/png/</a>). However, it has not been as successful as expected.

So I was pleased to read, in the Independent this morning, that the author <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article351353.ece\">has joined an appeal</a> to raise funds for the victims of the very severe drought that is currently killing hundreds of people and thousands of animals in Kenya.</p><p>As an African, I feel frustrated and humiliated that every time there is a natural disaster in any part of Africa, an appeal has to go out to the rich world for funds to save lives. But I have had to reconcile myself to the fact that the way the world economy is arranged now, Africa has no choice but to depend on the charity of the west when the worst comes to the worst.</p><p>For who is going to revalue African products in such a way that they will be bought for a decent price instead of an artificially determined one decided unilaterally by the rich countries on a 'free market' which they do everything to manipulate - including the overt undermining of the prices of Africa's agricultural products with subsidies?</p><p>If you think by talking about revaluation of the prices paid for products from Africa I am talking tosh, let me remind you that a barrel of petroleum used to cost less than $5 some decades ago but now costs about $60; and that an ounce of gold also used to be sold for about $35, whereas today, it's being bought for about $550. The prices of the two commodities have been revalued - with a vengeance.</p><p>The west has carried out economic subterfuge against the \"poor countries\" for over 100 years. But, as in the case of oil, the poor have sometimes been able to summon the muscle to fight back. It is through sheer economic trickery that the west has been able to accumulate the resources that it currently holds close to its chest. It could, if it chose to, work through the United Nations to put in place, mechanisms that could easily prevent, say, the drought in East Africa, from devastating the place as much as it is doing. But getting it to release money for such purposes is well-nigh impossible.</p><p>You see, most African countries occasionally experience floods or heavy rains, the water from which penetrates the earth to lurk uselessly in \"water tables\" deep underground. If this water had been oil, the west would know how to drill wells to bring it up pronto! But because it is \"only water\", and thus, unlike petroleum, of value \"only\" to the people whose lives it sustains, the west pretends that nothing can be done about the effects of the drought. Except tinker at the disaster it causes with offers of charity.</p><p>The technology is also available, in the 21st century, for \"seeding rain\" by spraying chemicals from an aeroplane into rain clouds identified as rain-bearing. But here again, this is a very expensive undertaking and cannot be readily afforded by any of the drought-ravaged African countries.</p><p>John le Carré points out that \"in the worst drought of the decade, 3.5 million people in northern Kenya are in imminent danger of starving to death, dying of thirst, or being killed in fights for survival.\" He then asks, \"Wouldn't it be wonderful if, this time round, we devoted as much money and energy to saving 3.5 million of our fellow citizens as we do to making war in other regions of the globe?\"</p><p>The Iraq war is estimated to have cost over $245bn already, and there's no end in sight. An infinitesimal fraction of this huge amount could give the drought-stricken areas of Africa all the water they need to keep human beings and animals alive; plus provide irrigation for crops; and also transform the African countryside by tapping for electricity, the solar power we have in abundance and which, at the moment, dries everything up and remorselessly slays man and beast.</p><p>And yet such huge sums have been deployed, instead, to kill or maim, so far, at least 100,000 Iraqis, slaughter over two and a half thousand American soldiers, as well as over a hundred British soldiers. All in a senseless war whose casus belli was based on pure lies. Or a \"hoax\", as Colin Powell's former chief of staff, Mr Wilkerson, describes it.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/mar/15/helpingafricatocombatdroug1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2006/mar/15/helpingafricatocombatdroug1","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Yesterday in parliament","webPublicationDate":"2006-03-02T10:25:22Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2006/mar/02/houseofcommons","fields":{"body":"<b>Tessa Jowell</b><br>\nClaims that the Home Office mishandled an extradition request from Italy involving David Mills, husband of the beleaguered culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, will be investigated, Tony Blair said. He told MPs: \"We will, of course, examine any allegations that are made and reply to them fully.\" <P><b>Schools reform</b><br>\nFurther concessions to Labour rebels over the government's controversial education reforms were ruled out by the prime minister. \nThe Tory leader, David Cameron, again pledged Conservative support for the education bill, due for its crunch Commons second reading vote in two weeks time. He said: \"Given you have our support, you don't have to make any further concessions to the rebels. So will you be clear - this bill will not be weakened any further?\" Mr Blair replied: \"Yes, I do make that clear.\" He promised that the education secretary would retain a veto over the creation of new schools by local authorities and insisted that by introducing the changes \"we are doing the right thing for our children\". <P><b>Guantanamo Bay</b><br>\nGuantanamo Bay is an \"anomaly\" and must close, the PM said. But he coupled his criticism of the camp, used to detain terror suspects without trial, with a fierce defence of the reasons for setting it up. Challenged by the acting Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Menzies Campbell, over the \"outrage\" of Guantanamo Bay, he said it arose from the worst terrorist attack ever seen in the world - the destruction of New York's twin towers. He urged Lib Dems to spend less time criticising the US and more on understanding the scale of the threat from international terrorism. <P><b>Iraq</b><br>\nMr Cameron joined the prime minister in sending condolences to the families of two British soldiers killed in Iraq. Mr Blair told the Commons the soldiers were doing a \"vital\" job and the country owed them a \"debt of gratitude\". Mr Cameron said: \"They died serving their country and we should honour their memory.\" Sir Menzies associated his party with the expressions of sympathy. <P><b>London bombings</b><br>\nThe prime minister defended the provision of information to relatives after the 7/7 London bombings amid accusations that the existing systems had failed. However, he pledged to consider an initiative by the family of victim Emily Jenkins to establish a website providing speedy information about victims in the event of a similar attack. <P><b>Gas prices</b><br>\nMr Blair said there was \"obviously a lot of concern\" about gas price hikes. Labour's Lindsay Hoyle told him it was \"totally unacceptable to have 22% price increases in gas at the same time as profits of &#163;1.5bn by British Gas. Has the time not come for a windfall tax to ensure investment in new gas streams in the UK and further introduction of storage facilities in order to bring the price down to help the poor consumer?\" The PM said: \"It is true that even with the increases we are still well below the EU median level and other countries have seen significant price increases as well. But of course you are right to draw attention to the fact these price increases are very steep. I happen to think one answer to it also of course is to liberalise energy markets in Europe still further.\" <P><b>Climate change</b><br>\nMr Blair said he had met the Stop Climate Chaos coalition and there were three \"major things\" that needed to be done. \"We need to strengthen the international framework - both through the UN process and also the G8+5 dialogue that has been very useful indeed, we need stronger action at a European level - in particular the extension of the emissions trading system post-2012 and we need action here too and we are looking carefully at the idea that was put by the coalition yesterday for a carbon budget.\" <P><b>Energy sources</b><br>\nLabour's David Marshall attacked opposition parties' approach to future energy sources. He said clean coal and new generation nuclear power alongside renewables were \"the sensible approach\". Mr Blair said: \"We need all those things together. We need the renewables, we obviously need to consider the issue of nuclear power for the future and of course clean coal technology is dramatically important as well.\" <P><b>TV licences</b><br>\nThe PM rejected a request to reduce the qualifying age for free TV licences to 65 from 75. He told Labour's David Crausby: \"I'm not sure I can do that I am afraid.\" Hailing initiatives such as the winter fuel allowance and free off-peak travel for OAPs, he added: \"Taken together with the money spent on pension credit, there has been a massive increase in support that this government has given to pensioners.\" <P><b>Parliament TV</b><br>\nMr Blair was told the lack of subtitles on the Parliament TV channel sets an \"extremely bad example\". Tory Jeremy Hunt said more than one million hard of hearing people used subtitles where possible. He added: \"There is no such facility on our own parliament channel and will you take urgent action to ensure that deaf people have the same access to democracy as everyone else.\" Mr Blair said: \"It is not up to me to decide how parliament arranges its affairs in that way.\" <P><b>Best wishes to the speaker</b><br>\nThe PM led MPs in sending good wishes to the speaker, Michael Martin, who is recovering from heart surgery. Mr Blair said: \"I'm sure the House will join me in sending our warm wishes for a speedy recovery to Mr speaker.\" Mr Cameron echoed the sentiments, hoping for a \"speedy return\" of Mr Martin to the chamber. Sir Menzies also sent best wishes on behalf of his party. <P><b>Oxfam report</b><br>\nThe government faced a grilling over an Oxfam report which found that a subsidiary of a British company sold military vehicles to Uganda, \"making a mockery\" of this country's arms control laws. It said BAE Systems' subsidiary Land Systems OMC, based in South Africa, supplied 32 personnel carriers to the repressive regime in east Africa. Andrew George, for the Lib Dems, sought reassurance that the international development department was not becoming a \"respectable front for lax and unacceptable practices of other government departments\". The international development secretary, Hilary Benn, said: \"The truth is it depends on the circumstances and it depends on the nature of the subsidiary and the extent, as I understand it, to which it is controlled by the company here in the UK.\" Mr Benn announced an additional &#163;15m aid to help people afflicted by drought in Kenya. <P><b>Historic buildings</b><br>\nA shake-up of the rules governing planning applications for England's historic buildings, intended to remove unnecessary delays and bureaucracy, was proposed by the government. A key change would see responsibility for determining most appeals relating to Grade I and Grade II* properties transferred from the secretary of state to planning inspectors. Planning minister Yvette Cooper said transferring jurisdiction would speed the process and give greater certainty to councils, developers and owners without putting the buildings at risk. <P><b>Dentistry</b><br>\nThe new NHS dental contract is a \"shambles\" and will lead to rising costs and even more patients unable to find a dentist, shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley warned. He accused the government of failing to fulfil its promise of September 1999 that by 2001 everyone would have access to an NHS dentist. Health minister Rosie Winterton said the new contracts being introduced next month constituted a \"very radical shake-up\". They would allow primary care trusts to commission and develop dental services and, for the first time, give them the financial power to commission new services when a dentist leaves an area or reduces their NHS workload. The contracts would lead to a \"simple and transparent\" system of dental charges. <P><b>Cancer services</b><br>\nIncreased government investment in cancer services has not been matched by substantial improvements in long-term mortality rates, Tories argued. Shadow health minister John Baron said it would be \"churlish\" not to recognise improvements in cancer care provision after extra NHS funding. However, there had been no marked improvement in overall mortality trends despite the extra funding, he added. The health secretary, Patricia Hewitt, said death rates from cancer were falling by 2% each year among people under the age of 75. It was falling \"particularly quickly\" for men suffering from lung cancer and women suffering from breast cancer. She said: \"We are well on course to meet the target that we set of reducing the death rate from cancer by 20% by 2010.\" <P><b>Smoking ban</b><br>\nThe government hailed its health bill, banning smoking in all English pubs, clubs and enclosed workplaces, as \"an important and historic measure\". Health minister Lord Warner said: \"We have come a long way in recent years but smoking is still the principal cause of premature death in England.\" <P><b>Super-casinos</b><br>\nThe government faced fresh calls to give the go-ahead to more than one super casino. Labour former minister Tony Lloyd said increasing the number of regional casinos was \"in the interest of Britain as a whole\". Culture minister Richard Caborn warned of the increase in e-gambling which had prompted the government inquiry into the whole issue. The \"cautious approach\" was the right one, he insisted. <P><b>Video games</b><br>\nA bid to make age restrictions and content labels larger and more visible on violent computer games was launched by Labour former minister Keith Vaz who has been leading a campaign for a crackdown on the sale of such software after the killing of Stefan Pakeerah in the city in 2004. Mr Vaz's video games bill, which aims to increase the size of the age certificate on video games, gained its first reading but stands little hope of becoming law. <P><b>Austin Mitchell</b><br>\nLabour's Austin Mitchell delivered a speech sitting down after being given special dispensation. Deputy speaker Sir Michael Lord said: \"Mr Mitchell is seriously incapacitated at the moment and is being given special dispensation to remain seated whilst he addresses the House.\" Mr Mitchell riposted: \"I am most grateful to have permission to remain sitting down for entirely non-alcoholic reasons.\" <P><b>Baby Cameron</b><br>\nMr Cameron was congratulated by the prime minister on the birth of his son, Arthur, on Valentine's Day. He told Mr Blair: \"Can I thank you for the flowers you sent to my family.\" To laughter, he added: \"You may not know that I also received flowers from No 10 and No 11. So I'm delighted to be the first man in history to get bunched by both our prime ministers.\" <P><b>Today in parliament</b><br>\nThe chancellor, Gordon Brown, and his ministers face the Commons at question time. The children and adoption bill is set to gain its second reading. The Lords debates the police, drug classification, municipal waste disposal, the transport act (consequential amendments) (Scotland) order and the rail vehicle accessibility (Gatwick Express class 458 vehicles) exemption order."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/mar/02/houseofcommons","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2006/mar/02/houseofcommons","sectionName":"Politics"},{"webTitle":"Obituary: Sir Hans Singer","webPublicationDate":"2006-03-01T00:26:39Z","sectionId":"business","id":"business/2006/mar/01/guardianobituaries.germany","fields":{"body":"<p>No economist of the 20th century was as persistent in focusing on the problems of developing countries or so creative in exploring what could be done to accelerate their development as Professor Sir Hans Singer, who has died aged 95. He had a career lasting seven decades from 1936, as an &eacute;migr&eacute; from Hitler's Germany receiving his doctorate at Cambridge, to a lecture last November. Extraordinary vision and energy issued from a small man, of modest appearance and mild-mannered stance, head often cocked to one side and bushy eyebrows, with a friendly but questioning smile. He was widely loved and deservedly feted.</p><p>Singer was one of the first economists employed by the United Nations, joining the UN economic affairs department in 1947. Working alongside the UN's first economist, David Owen, with Sidney Dell, VKRV Rao and Michal Kalecki, Singer gave intellectual edge to the rapidly expanding international organisation. Those were the days when the UN was acknowledged to be in the lead, the World Bank still being preoccupied with reconstruction in postwar Europe, and Singer rapidly became its working economist of choice, moving from new department to new department.</p><p>Singer left the UN in 1969 to become one of the first fellows of the new Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex. His prodigious output continued, though now under his own name. John Shaw, in his biography published in 2002, lists Singer's output: 107 books, 83 major reports, over 260 professional articles and an almost uncountable number of book reviews, letters to the press and other pieces. Singer added a few more books and articles during the last four years.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Singer's best known work relates to the declining terms of trade experienced by developing countries. Generally referred to as the Prebisch-Singer thesis, we now know the underlying analysis ought to be attributed to Singer himself, as argued in a recent book by John and Richard Toye.</p><p>The thesis, first published in 1949, tracked the long-term decline in terms of trade between developing and developed countries and analysed the causes. At the time, when Keynesian preoccupations were with short-term fluctuations in commodity prices, Singer's work attracted controversy. Many economists disputed the existence of a decline, but today professional opinion has shifted in Singer's favour. Much of the action Singer recommended has however not been taken, so that countries still dependent on coffee, cotton and other primary commodities for the bulk of their export earnings continue to lose out.</p><p>Singer made many other fundamental contributions to development thinking. In the 1950s, as secretary to the committee which recommended the creation of a UN fund for economic development, Singer did much of the technical work to create a soft-loan facility for poor countries. The fund was to be called by the acronym Unfed, until Singer pointed out how unfortunate a name this would be. So, as he delighted in telling, it became Sunfed, the Special UN fund.</p><p>None the less, Eugene Black, president of the World Bank at the time, did his best to keep it unfed, opposing the proposal for seven or eight years, and referring to Singer as \"one of the wild men of the UN\". By the end of the 1950s, the idea of concessional loans to poorer countries was accepted and became the basis for IDA, the International Development Association, established in 1960 and still serving today as the World Bank's main arm and multibillion-dollar mechanism for concessional lending to developing countries.</p><p>In 1961, the UN responded to President Kennedy's call in the general assembly to set up a Development Decade focused on reducing world poverty. Singer was the main drafter of the blue book which provided guidelines for implementation. His ideas on aid and development always had a creative eye to policy applications. He was the first to write about the problems of \"fungibility\" - how development assistance provided for one purpose could be used to support quite another, since it eased general budget constraints. This was one reason why Singer opposed tough conditionality in the use of aid.</p><p>Singer fashioned many of the ideas underlying food aid and the creation in 1963 of the UN World Food Programme, which bestowed on him its Food For Life award in 2001. Singer was one of the first economists to work in the Economic Commission for Africa and later served as the first director of research for Unido, the UN industrial development organisation (1967-69). For Unicef, Singer wrote the first document on children and economic development, which he thought so important that for several months he set aside his work on terms of trade. Indeed, there are few UN development agencies to which Singer did not at one time or another contribute.</p><p>Some of Singer's most significant contributions came at the IDS. He helped draft the Sussex Manifesto: Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade (1970). He revisited his theory of declining terms of trade, to give more attention to the part played by technological advance in developed countries. Singer was one of two main advisers to the World Employment Programme of the International Labour Office. In 1972 I was co-leader with him of the mission that produced the ILO Kenya report, Employment, Incomes and Equality. Singer on this mission originated the concept of redistribution from growth, which later became the theme for a seminal World Bank-IDS study, Redistribution with Growth. The Kenya report was also the first international document to draw attention to the positive contributions of the informal sector and laid the foundation for the \"basic needs strategy\" which for a few years became fashionable orthodoxy after the World Employment Conference in 1976.</p><p>Singer was born into a Jewish family in the Rhineland. At Bonn University, his brilliance brought him to the attention of the renowned economist Josef Schumpeter. In 1933, when Singer had to flee Nazi Germany, Schumpeter wrote to John Maynard Keynes in Cambridge, and Singer became only the fourth student to obtain a doctorate under his supervision. Soon after, Singer embarked on Men without Work (1938), a study of unemployment in Britain, supervised by William Temple, then Archbishop of York and later of Canterbury, with William Beveridge as its main adviser. Singer and his colleagues, Walter Oakeshott and David Owen, lived with poor families in five towns, to ensure a first-hand feel for the issues. Their study had an important influence on Beveridge's famous 1942 report on Social Insurance and Allied Services and his later Full Employment in a Free Society.</p><p>Notwithstanding these contacts and a post at Manchester University (1938-44), Singer was interned for about six weeks in the early months of the second world war, until released at Keynes' personal intervention. Singer often said he developed his deep sympathy for marginalised people in developing countries by growing up as a Jew in a Catholic area of Protestant Germany and later coming to Britain as a refugee. In 1945-46 he was at the Ministry of Town and Country Planning, and in 1946-47 at Glasgow University, till the call came to New York.</p><p>Singer maintained his extraordinary warmth, gentle manner and human concerns over his whole life. In the UN he was admired for his outstanding professional qualities, ready willingness to help and scrupulous avoidance of gossip and infighting. The UN old guard remembered him as maintaining his integrity even when singled out for attack by Senator Joseph McCarthy (for his work on Sunfed). Indeed, because of these pressures, Singer resigned from the UN in 1953, and only an appeal by Dag Hammarskjold, newly appointed as secretary general, stopped him leaving.</p><p>Singer was married for 67 years to Ilse Plaut Singer (obituary, March 13 2001), who brought her own moral commitments and an incisive and independent perspective to their partnership.</p><p>Singer always found time for others - for students as for colleagues - even while maintaining his prodigious output. He gave what was to be his last lecture without notes, pausing only to elaborate a point or to explain his early calculations for the UN on how much aid would be needed if developing countries were to accelerate their growth and development. Knighted in 1994, for services to economic issues, Singer is survived by his son Stephen.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Hans Wolfgang Singer, development economist, born November 29 1910; died February 26 2006</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/mar/01/guardianobituaries.germany","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2006/mar/01/guardianobituaries.germany","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Hilary Benn's speech on climate change","webPublicationDate":"2006-02-24T11:30:37Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2006/feb/24/development.internationalaidanddevelopment","fields":{"body":"Thank you Richard, BOND and Chatham House for hosting tonight's event. And thanks too for the classy way you have stirred up the audience! There is always a certain tension in the engagement between government and NGOs, and it needs to be creative, because none of us have all the answers.<P>This is the fifth in a series of speeches I am making as part of our consultation on the Government's development White Paper to be published in the summer. I think we are having a very good debate, and I am sure this evening's discussion will be no exception.<P>The challenge facing developing countries in making poverty history for themselves is becoming more and more complicated because we live in an increasingly interconnected world. And if I can leave you with one thought tonight, I want it to be this. The world is entering a stretch of rapids on the river ahead. And what we need now are maps of safe routes through the currents; a willingness to paddle together; and lifejackets for the inevitable bumps along the way.<P>These rapids are the result of national borders having become ever more porous to a host of different flows over the past few decades - people, ideas, capital, trade, viruses - real and virtual - carbon emissions and so on. And the result is a world with few islands left, as the distinction between the domestic and the foreign erodes. <P>The symptoms of today's problems will become the catalysts and the causes of tomorrow's crises. And it is already clear that we will have to deal with a number of global trends over the next ten to twenty years - some of them positive and some of them negative - that represent an even greater acceleration of the pace of change.<P>And I want to begin by listing some of them.<P>Climate change is happening faster than any of us anticipated even five years ago. And I'll say more on this later.<P>We are fast depleting natural resources including soil, oil, forestry, fisheries and water, and in the process creating potential flashpoints of conflict in the future. In just the last twelve months we have seen the results of water scarcity in Niger, Kenya, the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa, as well as in parts of Asia. <P>There is a double demographic time bomb. Ageing populations in industrialised societies with under-funded pensions and long term care liabilities, and a whole generation of teenagers wanting to find a job, and a life, in developing countries where employment and growth are stagnant. <P>This year, for the first time, more than half of the world's population will live in cities or towns - and the same will be true of Asia and Africa within a generation. <P>Infectious diseases and rising HIV infection, with death rates from AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa possibly spreading elsewhere. And as the climate changes so malaria moves. <P>Poor governance and inadequate accountability which can trigger state failure that then causes human insecurity, refugee migration, organised crime, conflict and, potentially, terrorism.<P>The multilateral system under serious examination at the very time when we need it most, but it has to show itself to be effective. <P>A clash not of civilisations but within them, as different value systems increasingly \"talk past one another\". The split between the \"sacred\" and the \"secular\" worldview in societies across the world.<P>And the endemic short-termism in our politics and economics that under-values the future relative to the present.<P>Now, all of these changes, all of these challenges, are partly the result of the same underlying shift it seems to me: the shift from a world organised primarily around independence to one increasingly based on interdependence. <P>In the light of this, I think there are five features of this interdependence that really stand out: <P>First, more interdependence - where countries come together and cooperate - can mean more safety. The European Union is a prime example of that. It has diminished the risk of another war between countries that spent much of the preceding centuries fighting each other.<P>Secondly, greater interdependence can also mean more risk, like antibiotic resistant illnesses, economic downturns, or currency crashes like the one that hit Asia in 1997. Interdependence can mean that you're more at risk from actions over which you have no control. Like the fact, for example, that rising sea levels caused by global warming will cause - some people say - a tenth of Bangladesh's population to have to move home - equivalent to more than all the people who live in Greater London. <P>Thirdly, global interdependence requires global management of its consequences. The erosion of borders between nation states creates a need for multilateral frameworks to manage shared resources, and shared challenges. Yet the most pressing global challenge of all - climate change - does not yet have a global framework for solving it. <P>Fourthly, the successful management of global interdependence will partly be about individual behaviour and values. Whether individuals drive their cars or take the bus. Whether they practise safe sex. How they treat neighbours of different faiths or ethnicities. Whether they finish the course of penicillin or not. National and international policy will increasingly be about trying to find ways to influence behaviour and change attitudes. Governments will not be able to solve these problems on their own.<P>Finally, and above all, the overarching and fundamental truth about global interdependence is this: interdependence means complexity and uncertainty, as well as opportunity. <P>I think this is the context. What are we going to do?<P>Well last year we made progress on aid and on debt cancellation. But this isn't going to be enough if we and developing countries are to create a better world.<P>The truth is, aid - in itself - is not enough. <P>This might come as a surprise to some people, who often think of development in terms of building schools, hospitals, and providing water, giving money to a charity, or what aid or debt relief can do. <P>But we all know it is more complicated than that. It's not just about money; other things we do matter as well, and we have to tell the whole story about what makes development possible.<P>Trade is a perfect example of that. The problem, as we all know, is that the poorest countries are denied a fair chance; they can't compete with protected and subsidised agriculture in rich countries.<P>We also know that if we can change this, the world's poorest countries will have the chance, with the right support, to grow, create jobs, and increase the incomes of poor people.<P>The argument about fairer trade used only to be made by development ministers. Nowadays trade ministers make that argument - something that would have been impossible to imagine two or three decades ago. <P>We know now that the policies we pursue matter just as much, if not more for development, than the money we give. <P>And that's why, at the launch of the Commission for Africa report, the Prime Minister committed the whole of the UK Government to implementing its recommendations. These have gone far beyond DFID's reach, and are about more than money. The Home Office has taken action to get the UN Convention Against Corruption ratified, the Foreign Office is working hard with the African Union to help create an African Stand-by Force by the end of this year. The Office of Science and Technology and the Department of Education and Skills is working with DFID to implement the recommendations on Higher Education in Africa. <P>This evening I want to take just two of the challenges which I touched on earlier which we will all have to make priorities over the coming years. The first of these is climate change, and the second is global governance.<P>Let me start with climate change.<P>Climate change is increasing the intensity and severity of natural disasters. 2005 was an unprecedented year for disasters - some made worse by our behaviour - the hurricanes in the USA and the Caribbean, and the food crises and drought across Africa, and some just natural in origin - the tsunami and the earthquake in Pakistan.<P>Disasters, as we know, affect poor people most. 97% of all deaths due to natural disasters occur in developing countries. The super cyclone that hit the Indian state of Orissa in October 1999 destroyed or damaged every single aspect of the state's infrastructure including roads, communication systems, public offices and schools. And as the sea temperature rises, cyclones we are told could become even more intense. <P>Climate change will have gradual but just as devastating effects. Sea levels are rising - a 1 metre rise projected over the next 100 years - and the result will be that people will be flooded from their homes. In sub-Saharan Africa, where a third of men, women and children are already malnourished, climate change could mean that food production is reduced by a fifth. Higher temperatures and shorter rainy seasons in Tanzania are expected to cut the main food crop, maize, by a third, making more people even more hungry. <P>Competition over natural resources already causes conflict. Climate change will make this worse. By 2025, only 20 years away, more than 3 billion people could be affected by serious water shortages. Some argue that we need a new agricultural revolution for water - a \"blue revolution\" to ensure the gains in food production are not wiped out as rivers run dry and underground reservoirs empty.<P>The truth is if we if we don't do something about climate change, aid from rich countries will look pitiful by comparison with the consequences and the costs for developing countries. <P>And yet climate change is not, primarily, the fault of developing countries. <P>So what should we do? I think there are four key things we need to do.<P>First, we need to keep publicising the science. We have much better models now for predicting the impact of climate change. There should now be no question about the science and at Gleneagles, G8 heads agreed on the scale and the urgency of the problem.<P>Second, we need to work for a global solution. <P>There is new momentum on Climate Change. At Montreal, just before Christmas, all countries signed up to discussions on what will happen after Kyoto runs out in 2012, at which point we will need a new framework. <P>Negotiations will take place through the UN, but the Gleneagles Dialogue we set up last year will also set shared goals for action by the G8 and five of the biggest emerging economies. But what should the new framework look like?<P>Many argue that we will need to agree what a \"safe\" level of carbon dioxide concentration would be if we are to stop dangerous climate change, and a deadline by which we need to meet that target. That's a job for both scientists and politicians.<P>We'll then need to come up with a way of dividing CO2 emissions between countries so that this safe level isn't exceeded. There are various ways of doing this. Some say that those who have polluted most should do more; others that each person on the planet should be able to emit the same as anyone else. But the international debate on all of this is at an early stage. <P>DFID's interest in all of this is that climate change is a problem caused by the rich countries which is having the greatest impact on poor countries. We cannot ignore the impact of our own actions on the climate, nor can we deny developing countries the chance to grow and to reduce poverty.<P>Poor countries need reliable and affordable energy to meet the Millennium Development Goals. People increasingly point the finger at the rapidly industrialising economies of China and India. But although China does emit around 14% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, second only to the United States of America, per person it produces 8 times less than the US. India is the fourth largest emitter globally, but per person emits only one-sixth of the global average.\n \nChina and India, and other developing countries however, will have to be part of the solution, but it has to be fair to have any chance of being agreed. Understandably, they will not sign up unless they have helped to design that solution, and unless they understand and can manage the impact it will have on their economies. <P>Any global solution is going to require developing countries to have the capacity to negotiate. So, as we have done on trade, we need to help build the capacity of developing countries to better analyse the implications, and work out what they want out of a global climate agreement. <P>Third, we need to reduce the volume of carbon emissions through the greater use of cleaner technology.<P>Working on the global framework is the big prize, but it will take several years. There is much that can be done in the meantime to reduce the global level of carbon emissions. <P>Like making sure developing countries are able to take advantage of cleaner and more efficient technologies. This is an urgent question for China and India because the power stations they are building now will stay in operation for a generation. And it is much much more expensive to make an existing power station more efficient, than to use more efficient technology to start with.<P>That's why Gleneagles asked the World Bank and other development banks to look at how to increase public and private investment in cleaner technology on a major scale - in the order of billions of dollars a year. <P>Making more use of clean technology is not just about reducing emissions. It is also vital to sustainable growth. High oil prices are a barrier to development for countries that don't produce their own energy. For Ghana the $35 increase per barrel in the last two years has meant that the annual cost of energy for that country is equivalent to nearly 70% of all the aid it receives. <P>Finally we need to help developing countries cope with, and adapt to, the impact of the climate change that we already know will happen, and make sure that they can plan to minimise its future impact. <P>Part of this is knowing more about what is going to happen in future, and not just what we know will already happen but that we can't change. The Global Climate Observation System, which DFID is helping to fund, will help to give a better picture about which areas will be most affected, including in Africa. <P>Once countries understand better what is going to happen, they will be able to plan and respond more effectively. And the way they will respond will depend on the kind of change, whether a sudden event like a flood or gradual change from rising temperatures and reduced rainfall. <P>We need to make sure that investment now takes into account the effects of climate change; for example, building roads that can still be used after they have been flooded. Work like this is being pioneered in Bangladesh and again supported by DFID. <P>And in the worst case, we will need to prepare for population movement caused by rising sea levels as I mentioned earlier in the case of Bangladesh.<P>But all these initiatives come at a huge price - far beyond what our aid can help with. And that's why Nick Stern's Review - which is due to report in October - is taking a serious look at the economics of climate change, to work out the best course of action and how all these things will be paid for. DFID has seconded two people to Nick's team to help make sure that development considerations is at the heart of these calculations. <P>We also need to remember that climate change is not something governments can solve by themselves - we will all need to take action to change our own lifestyles. To stop global warming, the average person in the industrialised world needs to reduce their carbon emissions by three quarters. One short haul flight to Europe emits over a fifth of our annual \"allowance\". One hundred miles in an ordinary family car produces over 3 times as much carbon dioxide as the same distance on a train. <P>Our consumption patterns even affect the global water crisis. While many of us would avoid leaving the tap running at home, how many people realise that the water needed to grow a T-shirt's worth of cotton is equivalent to 25 baths! Or that the water needed to produce the grain to make just a hamburger's worth of beef takes 3,000 baths!<P>Being a vegetarian does make me feel a bit better about that statistic ! <P>Now, the second major issue which I think we have to address is the global causes of bad governance. I talked a few weeks ago at SOAS about corruption and governance, but most of that was about what happens in countries. Now I'd like to talk about how bad governance can create insecurity and conflict, and lead to large scale theft and the squandering of the wealth and resources of poor countries. <P>One of the reasons this happens is that rich countries and we, their consumers, are willing to pay a great deal of money for valuable commodities, like oil and gas to keep us warm, and coltan to make our mobile phones work. This provides an opportunity for political elites in some countries to enrich themselves, and the ease with which money can now move around the world makes it easier to steal. <P>The DRC is an example of a country with huge natural resource wealth, above the ground, below the ground, but which has seen terrible conflict, bad governance and as a result desperate poverty. <P>Mobutu's appalling and corrupt regime was backed by rich countries for much of its history. During the 32 years he was in power, what was then Zaire received over $12 billion in aid - not just because Mobutu was on the side of the west in the Cold War, but also because of the DRC's huge wealth of natural resources. The whole economy of Zaire was geared towards institutionalised kleptomania for the benefit of those who controlled the army and the police. During that time, according to the UN, Mobutu embezzled $5 billion. <P>As the regime collapsed, different armed groups fought for control of these resources, including armies of neighbouring countries, with many doing deals with international investors along the way. The ensuing regional war led to the deaths of 4 million people - more than lost their lives in battle in the 1st World War. Some 1,200 people a day are still dying in the DRC from disease and malnutrition and violence.<P>We need to tackle the causes as well as the consequences, and in the DRC, help create the conditions in which new leaders will have an incentive to invest in their country. <P>What are we doing? Just to take some examples.<P>We're working with FCO, MoD and other donors to help create a safe and secure environment for people to live in, for example helping the DRC's transitional government to integrate various fighting forces into a proper national army. Some 50,000 soldiers have decided to return to civilian life and are being helped to do so. And for those who stay, we are supporting reform of soldiers pay, so that they do not resort to robbery and violence to make ends meet. <P>We're supporting the elections - the first the people of DRC will have experienced for 40 years - and in the longer term we want to ensure natural resources are used for the benefit of the citizens of DRC. Government revenue from the mining sector - copper, cobalt and diamonds - amounted to $15 million in 2004. Potential revenue - if governance had been better - is estimated to have been ten times that! Meanwhile the annual income for people from using forests - wood, charcoal, bush meat - is around $900 million - poor people depending on earning a living from natural resources.<P>So what we need to do is work to improve governance in the sector with the aim of attracting new investment from the private sector and improving the livelihoods of poor people who depend on these resources. <P>Our support to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the Kimberley process will improve the transparency of revenue flows and can help ensure that the exploitation does not continue to fuel the conflict. I hope we can get the support of Brazil, Russia, China and India for EITI best practice. A UN General Assembly resolution would give EITI legitimacy across the world, as I think we should be looking to apply its lessons to other sectors such as fishing or construction or forests or public procurement.<P>The new EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade regulation will help to tackle illegal logging in DRC. Globally the World Bank estimates that illegal logging results in $10-15 billion per year in lost revenue. <P>NGOs like Global Witness have been instrumental in documenting the trail of illegal natural resource exploitation and holding politicians and officials to account. And we will continue to support them in this role. <P>And I've just returned today from Darfur, where civil war has been fuelled in part by the fight over resources - has seen thousands and killed - numbers ranging from 80,000 to 300,000 to 400,000 - no one knows, because no one was counting. And just under 2 million people displaced.<P>And two camps I visited in El Fasher the day before yesterday are being supported by the international community.<P>A lasting resolution of the conflict in Darfur will require agreement on returning land and livestock; compensation, and opening up of transport routes to provide safe passage of people, livestock and goods.<P>The conflict has in part arisen from competition between nomads and farmers, with one group armed by the Government to take on the rebels. <P>The Abuja peace process and the wealth-sharing arrangements in particular, provide a framework - if those who are fighting are prepared to put bombs and bullets aside - for addressing these issues. The precondition for all of this is security. We are working hard to improve security on the ground through support to the African Union Mission in Sudan because despite continued ceasefire violations on the part of the Government and the rebel groups, and we are providing financial and technical support to the Abuja process. <P>And the message is that the world's patience has run out. Because the only chance the 1.8 million people - tonight and every night - have to leave these camps and go home is through peace.<P>UK support to peace building means that we have to bring together the development, defence and diplomatic parts of government. We have done this - one example - through our Conflict Prevention Pool. In Mozambique, we have funded the destruction of over 3,300 guns and 1.6 million rounds of ammunition. In Sierra Leone, the Pool has paid for the police, a functioning court system, and a comprehensive national security plan.<P>UK government departments are working closely together to fight international corruption. We did work very hard to get the UN Convention Against Corruption agreed, we reformed our own legal systems and we ratified it two weeks ago. And we are helping developing countries with the legal reforms they need in order to bring their legalisation in line with the convention.<P>We passed the proceeds of Crime Act in 2002 to fight money laundering. You'll have heard of Alamieyeseigha who fled the UK recently dressed as a woman. Well, he hasn't escaped justice, and is now in prison in Nigeria awaiting trial for stealing $55 million of public money and 40 counts of money laundering. And our shared work with other police forces led his assets to be seized by the South African authorities.<P>We need to do more to recover stolen assets - this is a long and complex legal process. In the UK, Joshua Dariye, the Governor of Plateau State in Nigeria, has had his assets seized in December last year, and we are making efforts to return them to Nigeria. An appeal is in progress.<P>So there's climate change and there's bad global governance. These are some of the problems. What these two examples of our interdependence demonstrate - and there are many others which I'm sure we'll discuss later - is that progress demands work across government; and across many governments. These challenges can't be tackled by any one department, and any one state; they are by their nature global. <P>I've talked about what the UK government is trying to do. And can I mention Tom Clarke's Bill - now gone through committee stage - which will help, for the first time requiring us to report not just on aid, but also on how other issues affect development.<P>Other countries do it differently. Germany requires their plans for helping countries to highlight issues of concern beyond aid, and one result is that there are new policies in Germany on arms exports and export credit schemes. Sweden has legislation; others have what they call policy coherence units. And last year all EU members agreed to report back on the action they are taking to promote a more coherent approach to policies that affect development.<P>And then, of course, there's you - the development and NGO community - because you keep us on our toes by pressing us - and long may you continue doing so - to ensure everything government does assists development.<P>Since these speeches are about consultation - this issue of interdependence and what we do about it is one on which I'd particularly like to know your views. Why ? Because, as I said at the beginning, none of us yet have all the answers. So, for each of the issues I've raised - and others you may think about, I want to end with these questions.<P>What should a \"whole of UK government\" approach look like, in say, 2010 or 2015? <P>What would a global plan for each of these issues look like by 2010 or 2015? And how much influence can the UK have?<P>What will happen if no action is taken? Which countries or regions are most at risk?<P>And how can we in the UK, and especially those countries and regions in the developing world, best cope with, and adapt to these changes?<P>What we are grappling with here are the consequences of our interdependence as human beings - the most complex area of all. So a really good reason for us to think about this and ask these questions."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/feb/24/development.internationalaidanddevelopment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2006/feb/24/development.internationalaidanddevelopment","sectionName":"Politics"},{"webTitle":"Jean Ensminger's work with Kenyan nomads threw up fascinating insights into the human animal.

Her neighbour wanted to use Ensminger's phone to call her mother and say she had decided not to take up the chance to work with Louis Leakey, the paleontologist who conducted discipline-defining work in the Olduvai Gorge in Kenya.

In her work with them she uses the Ultimatum game, common among experimental economists, but not, as she points out, among fieldworking anthropologists. \"You start with a day's casual labour wage - about $2 in Kenya. The experimenter explains the rules to a group of, say, 20 people. Then we bring the people, by themselves, into a room. They play the game completely privately with the experimenter. The way it works is everybody is paired with somebody else in that group of 20 and when they're brought into the room they're told whether they're player one or player two. If they're player one then they're allocated the whole two dollars and told that they can decide how they are to divide that money with player two. But they will never know who that is: it's anonymous. They're also told that player two has the option of refusing the offer in which case neither player gets anything. They both go home with nothing - joint losers. Now, the standard economic prediction is that player one will deduce that player two 2 will never be foolish enough to say no to anything, however 'unfair'. Therefore player one should offer the least amount possible because, on the bird-in-the-hand principle, it won't be rejected. But that's not, in fact, how people play the game.\"</p><p>Looking at Ensminger's results, it appears she is challenging two received ideas. One is that hunter-gatherer, or nomadic, societies encourage economic cooperation. Members share what they have with the group, and therefore there is no incentive to acquire things for oneself. Noble selflessness keeps the society forever poor. Thus it is that societies which are highly developed will always do better because of the entrepreneurial, individualistic incentives. Ignoble selfishness makes the society rich. Is this the bottom line?</p><p>'OK,\" she says, \"let me start with the first one. Yes. We have definitely come up with some findings that contradict some of the received thinking about hunter-gatherers. However it's not that what we knew about hunter-gatherers was wrong - the ethnographic record is right. They do share meat, they do share food. The question the anthropologist must ask is: why do they do that? Do they do it because it's just their nature? Is it, perhaps, in all of our natures to be generous and share? Or do they do it because they have no choice? In our games - guess what? Those hunter gatherers are not so interested in sharing everything. It goes along with other ethnographic data which supports the notion that when hunter gatherers actually have a choice, they don't always divide things up equally.</p><p>\"One of the reasons that we see so much sharing in hunter-gatherer societies is that everything is readily observed in those societies. They barely have houses. When a young Hadza male gets hold of trousers, this is revolutionary because it allows him to privatise property in his pockets. They like trousers for that reason. In the same way, the Au in New Guinea prefer their new opaque bags to the old string bags which you could see through. People can't see what they've got. So we have ethnographic evidence that indicates that in these societies where people do share very readily it isn't entirely voluntary.\"</p><p>Are Ensminger's findings at all applicable to contemporary America?</p><p>\"I also did the replications of this research in the US. There is a significant difference. What we find in both rural and urban America is a very, very strong moral sense of what is - quote-unquote - fair. In America, there was a very strong sentiment that the money was meant to be divided down the middle.\"</p><p>So is there a \"fairness gene\", so to speak, built into our wiring? Or are fairness and trust socially constructed?</p><p>\"The gene question's outside my area. But my hunch would be no, because if it were, we would see it strongly among hunter-gatherers, and we don't. As to how fairness and trust become imbued into society, my own feeling is - and I believe this is consistent with our cross-cultural results - you need a certain level of institutional development within the society (it's especially obvious, I think, with regard to trust) before you find these pro-social behaviours evolve, that is, which is good for the community, not just the individual. I would put fairness, co-operation, and trust in that category\".</p><p><strong>&middot; </strong>An extended account of Ensminger's research among the Orma can be found at <a href=\"http://pr.caltech.edu/periodicals/EandS/ESarchive-frame.html\">pr.caltech.edu</a>.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/feb/14/academicexperts.highereducation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2006/feb/14/academicexperts.highereducation","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"Tentacles reach for Africa ","webPublicationDate":"2006-02-10T12:56:43Z","sectionId":"theguardian","id":"theguardian/2006/feb/10/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1","fields":{"body":"The Chinese workers who have been busy for months laying paving stones in front of the white marble senate building in Libreville, Gabon, have finished. But another job awaits them across the road, with the construction of a media centre commissioned by President Omar Bongo.<P>Thousands of kilometres to the northwest, in Nigeria, their compatriots are equally busy. Last month Chinese representatives paid more than $2bn for a substantial share of one of Nigeria's offshore oilfields. In Mauritania the Chinese are prospecting for oil and gas. In Sudan they are operating a petrochemical plant. In Zimbabwe they have taken a controlling interest in a mobile phone operator. They are building roads in Rwanda and Kenya, rehabilitating farms in Tanzania, modernising Angola's railways, investing in forestry in Equatorial Guinea and Mozambique.<P>China is moving into Africa, advancing its pawns methodically and without too much concern for ethical issues. \"It is prepared to grant loans guaranteed by a country's coming oil production, a practice the International Monetary Fund [IMF] deplores because it jeopardises the future,\" says a French official. Nor does it pay much attention to politics or geography, investing in all economic sectors, from oil to telecommunications, forestry to public works.<P>China's activities are upsetting westerners, who tend to assume that they have exclusive rights over the continent's 54 nation states. Last summer the US Congress held a special hearing on growing Chinese influence in Africa. The French trade ministry asked all its economic development outlets to file a report on market penetration by China.<P>In 2002-03 trade between China and Africa increased by 50%, rising by a further 60% the next year. A few years ago the US and Britain were leading foreign suppliers in central and western Africa, bettered only by France. In 2003 China overtook the Americans and British. France is still the top exporter, but there is no certainty it will hold on to its lead. \"China has simply exploded into Africa,\" says Walter Kansteiner, a former US assistant secretary of state for African affairs.<P>The Chinese are pragmatic. The Central African Republic, for instance, is penniless after years of civil war. International donors, such as the IMF or the World Bank, are understandably hesitant. But not Beijing. Nor is its input restricted to finance. Its firms are prospecting for oil and designing a cement works; the countries have signed two cooperation agreements, covering agriculture and defence.<P>Sometimes the newcomers take advantage of a crisis to supplant their rivals. In 2002, when Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe introduced controversial agricultural reform, the West imposed sanctions. About 100 Chinese businessmen soon turned up in Harare. Four years later their work is bearing fruit, with interests in mining, transport, electricity production and transmission and mobile phones. There are now direct flights to Beijing.<P>Events in Ethiopia followed a similar pattern. At the end of the 1990s the war with Eritrea scared off the British and Americans. After a huge influx of subsidies, loans and volunteers, Beijing has become a key player in the local economy, working in pharmaceuticals, oil and roads. Its embassy in Addis Ababa is one of the finest in all Africa.<P>The top priority for China, as it collects prospecting permits from Mauritania to Gabon, is to secure access to African crude oil. Its appetite for African hydrocarbons, which account for 30% of its overseas energy bill, is certain to upset the US. In an attempt to reduce its dependence on the Middle East, Washington too has selected the Gulf of Guinea - Nigeria, Angola and Equatorial Guinea - as a strategic zone for oil supplies.<P>Chinese firms are also competing with their western counterparts in fields as varied as pharmaceuticals and telecommunications. In Mozambique the national phone company recently decided in favour of a Chinese company. The capital, Maputo, has an eloquent example of the decline in western influence: a new supermarket selling exclusively Chinese goods."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2006/feb/10/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2006/feb/10/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1","sectionName":"From the Guardian"},{"webTitle":"Prize draw","webPublicationDate":"2006-01-28T00:17:57Z","sectionId":"money","id":"money/2006/jan/28/graduates.graduation1","fields":{"body":"<p>Can you predict the future of communications?

Many see a competition win as a welcome addition, particularly when faced with statistics - like those published by High Fliers Research earlier this month - which warned of increased competition for places on graduate trainee schemes at the top 100 employers, despite record numbers of vacancies.</p><p>But could writing 2,000 words on your free surface fluid animation project, or designing a new Tango can, really land you a job?</p><p>Robert Silverton seems to think so. Silverton, a Bournemouth University graduate, won the British Interactive Media Association (BIMA) student prize in 2003 for the final-year project of his new media production degree.</p><p>Not thinking he had a chance of winning when his project was shortlisted, the 24-year-old considered staying away from the awards ceremony. Changing his mind, however, proved a lucky break as he was seated next to executives from Unit9, a new media production company, who he was able to talk to over dinner. \"You don't get an opportunity like that often,\" says Silverton. \"Money can't buy that sort of advertising, particularly for students.\"</p><p>Through that chance meeting, Unit9 offered Silverton freelance work, which helped when he decided to start his own internet software development company, Unwrong, with his brother in Edinburgh.</p><p>\"We got a really big job through them &#91;Unit9&#93;, based on the other stuff I had been doing. It was an incredible success and based on that and subsequent jobs we've been able to build the company on that.\"</p><p>Silverton does not believe he would have been so lucky if he had just sent the company his CV.</p><p>Heledd Charles-Williams, a graduate of the University of Sheffield, is still waiting to see if her 2004 SET prize for chemical engineering will open doors.</p><p>She had already secured a job as a process technologist in the food industry before winning her award, but now she's looking for a new job and putting her CV to the test. So far, she's managed to get an interview with a company that sponsors the SET awards, but was rejected for two other graduate schemes based on her application. \"I was a bit surprised. I thought I might at least get an interview,\" she says.</p><p>Despite this, Charles-Williams, 24, believes her SET award does add value to her CV. \"I definitely think you need to have something like this.

Mark Iremonger, the vice-chairman of the BIMA, which began awarding its student prize in 2001, says entering competitions was \"hugely important\", especially in the creative industries, which has a large number of small companies that employ few staff.</p><p>But it's not just about winning, he says. Submitted work is judged by some of the top people in the business. \"Senior people will assess students' work and give it more time than they would if just getting a CV ... it's quality time with senior executives.\"</p><p>He adds: \"If I was a student, the idea of not entering an award would be madness.\"</p><p><strong>Was it worth it? How L'Or&eacute;al awards helped</strong></p><p>Last year, Rise followed a group of UK undergraduates competing in the L'Or&eacute;al Brandstorm marketing competition.

Hilary Benn, the Secretary of State for International Development, thinks it's time to defend business against the fury of the anti-globalisers and recognise that without a thriving private sector no country can free itself from poverty.</p><p>'The poor are the private sector,' he says, just back from Ethiopia and Kenya. 'Those people I met in the village of Arba Minch, in Ethiopia, are part of a very small private sector. They are growing food and selling it; they're weaving mats and taking them to the market to sell.' Surveys of people in developing countries show that they believe self-employment, business and earning a wage offer them the best prospects of escaping poverty.</p><p>Benn says donors have to learn to think beyond the humanitarian crisis, when food hand-outs are vital, and put in place the building blocks of an expanding economy. Britain would like to see more countries follow the free-trade, high-growth model which has seen the Asian Tigers, China and India burst onto the global market place in the past 20 years. More than 400 million people have been lifted out of poverty in China in that time.</p><p>As part of government efforts to encourage private sector-led growth, more than 100 Asian business leaders will gather in London next month, at a Department for International Development (DFID)-sponsored conference, to discuss the next stage of Asia's development. Benn's attempt to rehabilitate the reputation of business in developing countries is part of a fundamental review of DFID's activity. After the frantic action of 2005, when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown used Britain's G8 presidency to wring fresh debt relief and aid from the rich world, the government has to decide how to spend the &pound;6.5bn annual budget DFID will have by 2007-08, as Britain raises its aid spending towards 0.7 per cent of GDP.</p><p>Benn is asking aid agencies what DFID can do to kick-start economic growth in the developing world, and how it should tackle issues such as bad governance. His dramatic decision to cut off aid to the rogue Ethiopian government last week, carrying out a threat made before Christmas, was an illustration of the tricky moral issues facing aid donors.</p><p>After telling the Ethiopian President, Meles Zenawi, of Britain's concerns, Benn flew back to London on Thursday to kick off the policy review with a defence of the private sector. 'The evidence around the world is pretty clear that economic growth and jobs are fundamental to lifting people out of poverty,' he says. 'Once you have made sure people don't starve to death, how do you get them out of the cycle of destitution?'</p><p>He described a 'safety net' scheme, funded by Britain, which he visited in Kenya last week, under which villagers receive a parcel of food, plus a little cash. 'It hasn't rained there for a year. You've had to sell everything. People said to me, \"This has meant we have been able to put a little money aside to buy clothes, utensils, small animals\". One householder said, \"I hope by next year I can buy some cattle\".'</p><p>Projects like this may require aid to get them started, but attracting foreign investment is critical. Benn uses the telecoms sector as an example of private investment in emerging economies: 'Africa is the fastest-growing market for mobile phones. People are prepared to invest because there's a return to be made. Technology is leap-frogging the landline generation. Some people may never own a mobile phone, but maybe someone in the village has one and they rent it to them for two minutes or so.'</p><p>Phone contact suddenly makes doing business much easier: 'You could ring the market and find out if anyone is buying cassava &#91;the root-crop which is a staple food in parts of Africa&#93; today.' He says fishermen off Tanzania have been using mobile phones to decide whether they will get a better price for their catch in Zanzibar or Dar es Salaam.</p><p>Global leaders will meet next week on the fringes of the Davos conference in Switzerland to try to breathe new life into the World Trade Organisation talks which stalled in Hong Kong in December. 'It's about how we can create sufficient pressure to move on the issues that got stuck in the run-up to Hong Kong.,' Benn says. But he rejects the charge, made by some trade campaigners, that the government has failed to devote enough effort to persuading its European partners to give up more of their lavish agricultural subsidies. 'Nobody could accuse us of not pushing hard for fundamental change,' he says.</p><p>Benn believes more has been achieved at Hong Kong than critics claim, but without better infrastructure, and the right legal and economic structures, rewriting trade rules would mean nothing to the world's poor.</p><p>'It's about building capacity. You need a fair opportunity to compete institutionally; but you also need to have something to sell, and capacity to move it.'</p><p>Passing through Bangladesh on the way to Hong Kong, he discovered that, whereas in some global ports, cargo passes through in six or seven hours, in Bangladesh it can take six to seven days - and involve 38 separate signatures. 'That is not because of the World Trade Organisation; it's not because of the colonial legacy; it's about how you choose to organise things,' he says. What is important is 'raising people's awareness that making changes to that can create a better climate in which to invest their money'.</p><p>He adds that 40 per cent of the wealth generated by sub-Saharan Africa leaves the region, to be salted away elsewhere. 'What message does that give about encouraging others to come and invest?'</p><p>Benn's pro-business message, which is backed by a new DFID pamphlet, 'Working with the Private Sector to Eliminate Poverty', may be difficult for aid agencies, traditionally suspicious of multinational companies operating in poor countries, to swallow. But if a WTO deal opens the door to new markets and opportunities for producers in Africa, Asia and South America, Benn believes thriving businesses and keen entrepreneurs, with an injection of foreign cash, do offer the best hope of making poverty history.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jan/22/theobserver.observerbusiness11","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2006/jan/22/theobserver.observerbusiness11","sectionName":"Business"},{"webTitle":"Full text of Hilary Benn's speech on growth and poverty reduction","webPublicationDate":"2006-01-19T00:07:05Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2006/jan/19/development.internationalaidanddevelopment1","fields":{"body":"<b>Growth and poverty reduction - creating more and better jobs in poor countries</b><br><P>Stewart, Andrew, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to the New Economics Foundation for organising this evening's event, not least because your professionalism, dedication, and commitment are widely admired.<P>Although I remember the last time I spoke here I was a prisons minister - politics can be an uncertain business!<P>This is the first of a series of speeches I am making to launch the consultation on the government's development White Paper to be published in the summer.<P>And you may well ask \"what will it be about?\"<P>Let's reflect for a moment on what we achieved last year.<P>And by we, I do mean we. All of us. None of this would have been possible without the Make Poverty History campaign in the UK, and campaigns around the world.<P>None of this would have been possible without politics - the tide of people calling for justice.<P>Last year 15 EU states agreed to reach the UN 0.7% target by 2015; the G8 to $50 billion, with $25 billion to Africa by 2010. At Gleneagles we agreed a new target of by 2010 access for all to AIDS treatment. Free basic education and health care.<P>Later on, we saw an International Finance Facility for Immunisation launched, which aims to save 5 million children's lives over the next decade, and the UN agreeing that states have a Responsibility to Protect their citizens, and that if they fail in this, we, the international community, must take on that duty. And we agreed a new humanitarian fund for places like Niger or to respond to the earthquake in Pakistan.<P>In essence this new White Paper is about asking ourselves these questions and trying to find answers. How do we turn all of this political agenda in 2005 into more children in school and fewer people dying of AIDS or malaria? What should we be doing in fragile states? What's the best way to build country capacity? How do we ensure that the international development system works effectively to eliminate poverty? And what should DFID be doing in all of this?<P>Over the coming weeks I'll talk about the main themes of the White Paper - reform of the humanitarian system; how we deal with corruption and governance; public services; areas beyond aid which are vital to development - trade, climate change, migration - and finally on the shape of the international development system we have created.<P>Your ideas will help us improve our own; after all, Government does not have all the answers. And I would welcome your response to our consultation document - available tonight and on DFID's web-site - and to this series of speeches - in which I must confess I also aim to provoke.<P>This is the first speech - and it's about growth and poverty reduction - creating more and better jobs in poor countries.<P>Why have I chosen this?<P>You could say, \"It's the economy stupid\", and you'd be right.<P>Poor people in poor countries want the same things that we do here - they want to have a decent job, to meet their basic needs, to lead a fulfilled life, take good care of their children and have a role in their community and in society.<P>In poor countries, very little of this is possible without a growing economy. Only by growing your economy can you secure employment for all.<P>Let's imagine a poor farmer in Malawi. What do you think her chances are of a better life, and that of her children?<P>Almost no chances at all in an economy that is stagnant.<P>If she is lucky she'll have a small plot of land, she'll travel, say, 8 miles to buy fertiliser and better seeds, or to sell her produce.<P>Trapped in this kind of agriculture, with no other choice of employment, she can't produce or buy enough food to meet the needs of her family, and decent healthcare and schooling for her children are simply not possible.<P>It should be no surprise then that half of Malawi's children are malnourished, and their growth and development stunted, or that half of all children enrolled drop out of school at standard 5 unable to read, write or count. Nor that Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world.<P>And this story is repeated across much of Africa where 70% of employment is in agriculture.<P>The only chance she and her children have of a better life, is if they have the chance to be part of a growing economy. The chance to live in a country with more and better jobs; ways of earning a living.<P>On current trends, poor countries, even with growth rates 2% per person per year, will take two generations to double the incomes of poor people. This is too slow.<P>Even with faster rates of growth, it's going to be a long term process.<P>But there are grounds for optimism.<P>High and sustained growth in successful Asian countries has led to the greatest number of poor people being lifted out of poverty in human history.<P>The number of people living on less than a dollar a day dropped over the last 20 years from 1.5 billion to 1.1 billion - an incredible achievement, in one sense given that the world's population grew by 1.6 billion during that time. China alone lifted 400 million people out of extreme poverty.<P>Vietnam has doubled the size of its economy in the last decade. This was accompanied by a fall in poverty from three-quarters in the late 1980s to under a third in 2002, with \"extreme poverty\" half that - the most rapid poverty reduction on record.<P>And growth rates have risen in many other poor countries, including in Africa where over the past decade, 16 countries have seen rates of over 4% - including 10 with rates over 5%, and 3 with rates over 7%.<P>Now I think that shows us progress is possible, but only if that growth can be sustained by the world's environmental carrying capacity - a point I will return to later on.<P>The Make Poverty History and other campaigns last year focused on more and better aid, debt relief and international obstacles to trade - on education, on HIV/AIDS - all absolutely critical and where we have made considerable progress.<P>But I do feel that many of these campaigns say little explicitly about the creation of more and better jobs for poor people. I think there is little real debate about growth.<P>Amongst some there is even hostility to the idea of international integration into the global economy. Some argue that globalisation is a race to the bottom. And amongst others there is a mistrust of the private sector.<P>I say that because it reflects the meetings I have.<P>This is not in the interests of poor people.<P>Yesterday morning in Arba Minch in Ethiopia I drove up the mountain to visit a safety net project, coming down were people carrying bamboo poles and woven mats - taking them to market to sell. This is the private sector - 9 out of 10 jobs are in the private sector.<P>Poor people are the private sector, they are the farmers and small businesses that we are trying to help.<P>Ask poor people where the best prospect for escaping poverty lies - they'll tell you it is through self-employment or business - a good job.<P>Making Poverty History will not be possible without more and better jobs in poor countries.<P>And by ignoring job creation and growth, poor countries will be relying on aid indefinitely. And that's in no ones' interest. And it's not, on its own, a solution.<P>We have to do better.<P>Social justice should be provided, not at the expense of the economy, but founded on it.<P>A strong economy that provides everyone with a job or the chance of one; that helps the vulnerable who struggle to make an adequate living, and that can support free basic education and health care - is what is needed.<P>I think we need a better debate than this. I hope the White Paper process can help us do that, and I look forward to our discussion this evening.<P>I think there are seven essential ingredients of growth and poverty reduction.<P>The first is undoubtedly a stable macro-economy - with reasonably low levels of inflation and responsible and sustainable levels of public debt. Because stability is the precondition for growth. High levels of inflation hit the poorest hardest.<P>Here in the UK stable macro-economic policy and fiscal discipline has helped us achieve the longest period of economic growth in 200 years, low levels of inflation and high levels of employment. And what holds true here is no different for poor countries.<P>And we have seen real progress amongst poor countries in improving their management of the economy - where for instance, between the mid-80s and mid-90s inflation was on average 50%, it is now a tenth of that. This is encouraging.<P>However stability, whilst necessary both for growth and reducing poverty, is certainly not sufficient.<P>The second is through getting conditions right for the private sector and improving the investment climate.<P>The aim must be to bring products to market of the right quality and price, while at the same time creating more jobs. This requires a host of things as we know: building up educational and skill levels, becoming technologically innovative, improving productivity, and managing international integration. A tall order for any country!<P>I would like to suggest that the single most important thing a developing country can do to benefit from the trade and investment opportunities thrown up by globalisation, is to get their investment climate right. By that I mean the specific factors that create the opportunities and incentives for firms to invest, create jobs, raise incomes, create a better life. And where people earn, pay tax, and where governments can then spend and invest.<P>This is because improvements in the investment climate lead to increased rates of productive investment and economic growth. And in turn this leads to more and better jobs, and sustained reductions in poverty.<P>The investment climate is fundamental for both domestic and foreign investment - and we should remember that the bulk of investment in developing countries - some 80% - is domestic.<P>The basic conditions that are right for farms and small businesses, are also good for large firms, and multinational corporations too.<P>And I just want to look at two key areas - infrastructure, and a supportive financial sector.<P>The road I drove up yesterday is being extended. People said the road helps them get to the market quicker.<P>On a much bigger scale, if you compare a map of Africa with India, you will see their roads and rail connect resource-rich areas to the coast. India's roads and rail join India.<P>So it is no surprise that the cost of moving a container between Accra and Lagos is three times the cost of moving it to Europe, and that transport costs in Africa are twice that of Asia.<P>No surprise that's one reason poor farmers can't improve their land - why? Because fertiliser is too expensive, in part, because of no roads.<P>The Commission for Africa noted that the major part of investments into the roads and railway networks that Africa needs must come primarily from public investment, including aid.<P>I agree - we went through a period where the world deluded itself that this should come from the private sector.<P>But that doesn't mean the private sector can't play a part too.<P>DFID supports several facilities that help governments harness private investment for infrastructure. We've spent about &#163;100m over 6 years on these, and we reckon they've promoted some $1.5 billion of extra investment in poorer countries.<P>As an example, one of the facilities - DevCo - advised the Mozambique government on getting the best deal for the development of coal mining in Moatize. The result was that a Brazilian company agreed to invest some $2 billion in a venture that will create up to 5,000 new jobs and earn the government some $80m a year in royalties and taxes - and more money to spend on education and health.<P>Or telecoms - CDC - wholly owned by DFID, has helped to deliver mobile telecommunications across Africa through its investment in Celtel. Celtel has more than five million direct customers in 14 countries, and provides coverage for 30% of Africa's population. It's the biggest tax payer in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has created 4,000 jobs across Africa.<P>And this technology is making a difference to poor people - think again of the farmer in Malawi - borrowing or paying to use a mobile phone means she can check prices at other markets and get a better deal - rather than accepting whatever price she'd be offered when she got to her nearest market. It would mean that if telephones were available in Arba Minch then villagers would be able to check whether it was worth the 8 hour walk to market, up and down the mountain.<P>Access to a bank - to credit or having an account - is another crucial part of the investment climate. While in the UK more than 90% of the population have access to banking services, in African countries this can be the reverse, with more than 90 percent of the population financially excluded.<P>This means that people cannot save money safely to protect against an unexpected crisis, and that farms and businesses cannot finance their expansion.<P>When I was in Kenya three days ago, one of the things people said to me was that access to credit was a serious problem because of extremely high interest rates.<P>Remittances, another financial service, are in some countries 40% of a household's income, and have been shown to reduce poverty. Better access to lower cost remittances can make a real difference to peoples' lives.<P>Getting the investment climate right also includes other areas too, such as property rights or market regulation.<P>Property rights do have a role to play. In Peru around 90% of businesses have no title to their property, making it very difficult to borrow money and hard to invest.<P>In Vietnam rural households got increased rights when land was de-collectivised, making it worthwhile for them to invest in their land, raising production and growth. Informal and customary arrangements in many countries mean that reforms need to take into account the interests of poor people, within a proper legal framework.<P>Now you also need regulation to address market failures such as monopoly powers of large firms, and ensuring that firms have an incentive to control pollution. Or to ensure that appropriate labour standards encourage job creation, but also jobs where people can work in dignity.<P>That's why we do need decent work. That's why we need free trade unions to turn work into a better life for people.<P>Some countries regulate too little, and others regulate inappropriately or too much, which imposes huge costs on the private sector. Red tape makes poor countries uncompetitive.<P>Let me give you an example, when I passed through Bangladesh on the way to the WTO meeting in Hong Kong, and was told that it takes 6 to 7 days to turn around a ship in the port, compared to 6 to 7 hours in Singapore. It takes 38 signatures to get your goods through the port and into Bangladesh, but only 2 in Singapore! These barriers to trade are not because of the WTO or a colonial legacy - and it's not too hard for governments to do something about this.<P>The third is in raising agricultural productivity.<P>It is a simple fact that virtually no country - be it China, India, the USA or the UK - has achieved economic progress and improved the welfare of its people without first achieving progress in agriculture.<P>It was certainly the case in Asia where cereal production has tripled over the last 40 years, lifting millions out of poverty through increased incomes, cheaper food and more employment.<P>But perhaps most importantly, evidence from Asia and Africa shows that improvements in agriculture not only reduce poverty, but help the rest of the economy grow. In Zambia, each dollar of additional farm income creates a further one and a half dollars of income outside agriculture.<P>These gains beyond agriculture are particularly important with growing urbanisation - over half of Africa will be urbanised in twenty five years time - and so creating jobs inside agriculture, yes, but also outside of agriculture is a priority.<P>The fourth through trade.<P>Poor countries more than anyone else need a fair and transparent global trading system, and equally importantly they need to develop the capacity to take advantage of it.<P>More and better jobs will come from more trade and investment.<P>Getting the conditions right for farms, small firms and large business will help build the capacity of poor countries to trade and to benefit from the gains from trade.<P>Because without trade, they will have to try to make a living from small markets. And in small, closed, markets, there are no economies of scale, prices are higher, there is less choice. What is the biggest market after all? The world.<P>No country has developed without increased trade. To integrate with, and to compete effectively in the regional and global economy, countries need to manage a complex range of reforms - phased in different ways to meet different country circumstances. And this is what successful countries have done with their trade and development strategies.<P>At the same time, neither is this to say - as some NGOs do - that trade liberalisation is never the right thing for developing countries. The key point is that there are no \"one size fits all\" models - that's why I introduced DFID's new conditionality policy and why Labour's last election manifesto committed us to no forced liberalisation, and why we have argued this in discussions on world trade.<P>China is the obvious example of the potential of trade to lift millions out of poverty, and Sub-Saharan Africa's declining world share of trade - from 6% in 1980 to 2% in 2002 - costing some $70 billion a year - is an example of the reverse.<P>But trade reform - while leading to large overall gains - does involves winners and losers. That's why we need to help countries address the costs of reform, and build capacity, and why the UK Government has committed to provide &#163;100 million per year in aid for trade by 2010.<P>Now all of these issues are fundamental to the Doha Round, and this is the year the Round should conclude. And the truth is that all of us were disappointed with progress at Hong Kong, we need to do better - and I'll talk more about where we go next in my speech next month.<P>A fifth area is in investing in people - providing decent and free basic education and health care, and income support for those who need it.<P>It's simply not right that over 100 million children are not where they should be - in school. Nor that 30,000 children die each day from easily preventable diseases.<P>And the truth is good public services are vital for growth too.<P>In a globalised world, the number of years of education can be a proxy for income. An extra year of schooling for a girl can raise her eventual wages by 10 to 20 per cent. Expanded access to secondary education is linked to increased employment away from the farm. And Malaria, unless we beat it can reduce growth by over 1%, and AIDS by up to 1.6%.<P>Now income support - or \"social protection\" - or \"safety nets\" - can stop the Malawian farmer selling precious assets - her livestock, seeds for planting and tools - when she suffers a crisis, such as a drought or someone in her family becoming ill.<P>They can encourage her to take risks with higher yielding crops. They can encourage poor families to keep their children in school - as shown by successful schemes in Brazil and Mexico. All of which contributes to growth, but also to a fairer and more equitable society.<P>A sixth issue is environmental sustainability.<P>Because at the New Economics Foundation you know all about this, and I'm sure you'd agree that it's a myth that developing countries can go for growth and worry about environmental sustainability later on.<P>Environmental wealth - natural resources - is one of the main sources of growth in developing countries, and central to the livelihoods of poor people.<P>But at the same time we can't, and shouldn't, deny poor countries the chance to grow their way out of poverty. More industries, more places where people can work, factories, agriculture, are good for poor people - it's about more and better jobs. Poor countries will use more power, consume more resources - and they will need to, if they are to grow.<P>But we can help countries develop better approaches, using assets - forests, water - more sustainably, and help them to manage the environmental impacts of their growth. This includes better environmental information for economic planning, and the use of more efficient and newer technologies - for instance, clean energy.<P>And of course, we also need to focus on the global consequences of growth, because above all in the case of climate change, unless we do something about it, it will have huge negative consequences for us all, and especially for poor countries who are worst affected.<P>This illustrates a point that NEF has made: that the relationship between growth and sustainability is above all about equity and fairness. We know developing countries need to grow their economies. But we also know that all 6 billion of us can't consume at the same unsustainable rate as those of us in the developed world.<P>And the implication I think is clear: if developing countries are to develop sustainably, then part of the deal has to be that we in the industrialised world reduce our carbon emissions and other unsustainable use of resources, if we are to stay within globally sustainable limits.<P>I want to come back in more detail to some of these challenges in another speech in February.<P>And finally, strong institutions and capable states<P>Perhaps more important than anything else, is the ability of governments to promote development - to prioritise wealth and economic growth and job creation.<P>Unless you have a capable and effective state it is impossible to make progress in the areas I described earlier. Strong institutions matter more than anything else in explaining the difference in growth performance between different countries.<P>It's necessary for making markets work properly, for regulating markets. For example the interests of consumers and workers need to be protected along side the legitimate interests of producers.<P>This is not about privatisation, or multinationals taking over, but about getting the conditions right for poor people to earn a living.<P>These are the seven key areas that will drive growth and poverty reduction, but poverty reduction can be made faster if poor peoples' participation in growth is increased. In other words equity is important.<P>Those who are excluded from opportunities to raise their incomes - from markets, from social and economic assets - have got to be included in order to maximise economic growth and social development.<P>Growth in Uganda between 1992 and 2003 was high at over 3% per person per year. But over the same period, inequality rose. Had inequality remained unchanged in Uganda, an extra 2 million Ugandans would have been lifted out of poverty.<P>If income inequality is high, or rising, or if poverty reduction is low despite growth, then more action should be taken to address inequalities in access - including to land, or to opportunities. It also means tackling the power structures that exist in these societies - so that people can have greater say in decisions that affect their lives.<P>Our agenda is about growth with equity, not either or.<P>Now all of this is easy to say, easy to describe, harder to do.<P>Because the trade-offs between promoting growth and promoting equity are complicated. And as with all policy choices there are winners and losers; and the status quo is also a policy choice with its own winners and losers.<P>We need to do more to help countries assess the impacts of such choices and weigh up the pros and cons, and take their own decisions about their future development.<P>We know that growth is key, but how to achieve these ends is more controversial than the ends themselves.<P>The Washington consensus approach is now in its death throes, and very few will mourn its passing. A \"one size fits all\" approach didn't focus enough on reducing poverty. We have learnt more about the important role of governments in fostering development and investing in institutions and people, and more about the need to address the costs of adjustment.<P>And this does not mean in picking this subject, that I believe that business and investment alone will solve the problems of poverty. They won't. The private sector needs capable states, needs a sound investment environment, needs infrastructure, governance, investment in human development and social protection.<P>The approach I have tried to outline, however is intended to stimulate debate. We want to hear what you think. Because in essence, it's a part of the development story that we need to tell more often - the story of how growth should become a more central part of progress in poor countries. Question - do you agree?<P>Ultimately progress is in the hands of poor countries themselves, and while getting the economy right is fundamental to progress - it is political will that will deliver the changes necessary. \"It's the economy, stupid\" is right, but underlying that is another truth. \"It's the politics, stupid\".<P>After all it was politics which achieved all those things in 2005. It is politics that decides levels of spending on health and education. It is politics that determines what kind of society it is we wish to live in and to create and hand on to another generation.<P>But that's for another day and another speech."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jan/19/development.internationalaidanddevelopment1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2006/jan/19/development.internationalaidanddevelopment1","sectionName":"Politics"},{"webTitle":"Benn defends aid for GM crops","webPublicationDate":"2005-12-08T10:32:29Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"science/2005/dec/08/gm.food","fields":{"body":"<p>Britain is to direct more foreign aid to develop genetically modified crops in Africa to speed up economic growth on the continent and use modern science and new technologies to tackle hunger.</p><p>A paper from the Department for International Development, launched yesterday by international development secretary Hilary Benn, includes commitments to promote patented GM seeds and scientific research by GM firms.</p><p>But Mr Benn said that it was up to individual developing countries to decide whether they wanted the controversial technology. \"We should work on the basis of good science.

What they make it (Heaven? Hell?) can be open to conjecture. My two girls are at different stages - the toddler still believes in Father Christmas, the teenager believes rather more fervently in Topshop, iPods, Benefit High Beam, and cash (lots of it).</p><p>Polaroid cameras are super-hot this year, coolly meshing the teenage girl's main characteristics - self-obsession and instant gratification. By comparison, toddlers are a cheap date at Christmas - dolls, dressing-up clothes, Duplo, a rocking horse for the traditionalists. Oddly, this year, there's been some clamouring for toy housework utensils (vacuum cleaners, ironing boards), so in the spirit of the times I intend to get a DNA test to prove that she's mine.</p><p>Me? Shucks, I'd be happy with anything so long as it's reassuringly expensive, to the point where the giver goes bankrupt (adults) or handmade with glitter and Pritt Stick (children). I'd also like not to have a hangover on Boxing Day - which could be viewed as a gift to all.</p><p>However, the nice thing about having children around at Christmas is nothing to do with gifts - it's being able to have another attempt at the Childhood Christmas yourself, to make it what your own wasn't. That could be why I always start the season with the children decorating the most overdone, tasteless tree ever, complete with bog-roll angel, short-circuiting lights, and Woolies chocolate novelties. Hard on the eye, yes, but fun as well.</p><p>I'm not only giving them memories, I'm giving myself some, too.</p><p><strong>Nigel Slater </strong><br />Cookery editor</p><p>The great thing about edible Christmas presents is that they tend not to hang around looking embarrassed like an unwanted bibelot. Greed and a healthy appetite see to that. To be honest, I would be perfectly happy with a simple lump of Parmesan Reggiano from Valvona &amp; Crolla in Edinburgh, or a bottle of sloe gin from Bramley and Gage of Devon, though I wouldn't honestly turn my nose up at anything edible that's chosen with love.</p><p>For those who prefer to give something a little more lasting I have made a short list of kitchen-related objects that I find both beautiful and useful: a set of silver cutlery made to order from Egg, perhaps; beech chopping boards from Margaret Howell, or pretty much anything from the kitchen treasure chest that is Summerill and Bishop in Holland Park (020 7221 4566).</p><p>Of course, Christmas shopping is so much easier now, with so many irresistible catalogues and internet sites, that anyone, anywhere can do their shopping at the click of a mouse. In which case can I direct those who really want to show how much they care to the delights of the kitchen section of <a href=\"http://www.manufactum.com\">www.manufactum.com</a>.</p><p>As I always say, if you are going to do something, you might as well get it right.</p><p><strong>Lucy Siegle </strong><br />Ethical columnist</p><p>Giving ethical Christmas presents just gets easier and easier. From the brocade jacket by Edun (designed by Mrs Bono) to the silk Eco Boudoir cushions for Coco de Mer, these are 'worthy' gifts drenched in style, glitter and general gorgeousness. This year I even got to wear red velvet high heels from Bourgeois Boheme - free of any animal derivatives.</p><p>But who cares about me when I've been upstaged by a goat? Tammy travelled up from Newhaven city farm to eat the belt off my cardigan and encourage you to donate a goat to a subsistence farmer in the developing world. This year, as well as offering the standard goat (&#163;24, <a href=\"http://www.oxfamunwrapped.com\">www.oxfamunwrapped.com</a>), Good Gifts (<a href=\"http://www.good-gifts.org\">www.good-gifts.org</a>) has a super goat for &#163;75, specifically bred for conditions in western Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe. They breed faster, producing more sets of twins and are of huge value to local communities.</p><p>Tammy is used to the limelight, but the vertical axis wind turbine, by Quiet Revolution, is an ingenue. This is not its actual size - the real version, 5m x 3m, generates enough to keep an average house supplied with energy for the foreseeable future. And although it costs &#163;25,000, I'd love one. Like the goat, it's the gift that keeps on giving.</p><p><strong>Monty Don </strong><br />Gardening editor </p><p>It is a sock thing. There comes a point in every man's life when the prospect of socks for Christmas is actively desirable. Some of this is down to a male hatred of shopping for mundane stuff and partly it is a realisation that socks are that perfect marriage of function and form.</p><p>My garden feels the same. All the seemingly dull things that are indispensable in any garden make the most desirable presents, especially if they are the best version. So, a good ball of tarred string (not twine) is essential for tying in anything that is temporary, but it must be really strong for up to a year. On the other hand, soft green twine is much more appropriate for tying in soft stems. To have a year's supply of both in my stocking is a joy.</p><p>Good secateurs, knives and my own favourite, bill hooks, are another joy. And this is not the time to scrimp and save - you get what you pay for when it comes to gaining an edge.</p><p>Finally, there's one book every garden owner should read. The fantastic Birds Britannica by Mark Cocker and Richard Mabey is a compendium of ornithology, folklore, anthropology, etymology and a celebration of one of the most undervalued parts of everyone's gardens. It is a joy.</p><p><strong>Jo Adams </strong><br />Fashion editor </p><p>There's nothing worse then opening your stocking and getting another misshapen jumper from Auntie Mabel and a nylon nightie that you can't get within 10ft of an open fire in. How to avoid festive disasters? Start a carefully honed, hint-dropping programme now. Gather your weapons close - mail-order catalogues, internet print-outs, magazine pages - and scatter them in reach of present-giving loved ones. Think of this as much-needed guidance. If you love the peep-toe Marc Jacobs heels on this page, circle them now.</p><p>However, if the mule is on the other foot and you are the giver, then there are some fashion gifts that are sure-fire winners. Sexy lingerie, for example. Agent Provocateur always comes up trumps in this department, but don't be afraid of the mainstream: M&amp;S has a great a silk line. Most of us also love the idea of holidays, so I'd recommend a stylish globetrotter case. Even if you don't go anywhere, it looks great in your bedroom where it can store handbags and jewels. Or there's Chloe's nude-coloured dress with jewelled shoulders, guaranteed to see you into a glamorous new year. And for shoeaholics, try the Blahnik by Boman book - shoe porn for people like me.</p><p><strong>Phil Hogan </strong><br />Family columnist</p><p>As our boys get older - almost three out of the four in their teens now - Christmas stockings get smaller. Even the youngest, eight, joins his big brothers in their preference for CDs, plug-in assassin-based games, iPods and smutty adolescent movies. Having said that, one of them is up for a bike this year and our ancient Scalextric - we had it out a couple of wet Sundays ago - could do with some new cars and a mile or so of extra track.</p><p>When Dr Who was on TV this year, I bored the youngest to death telling him how brilliant the Daleks were and how, when I was his age, I once entered a competition to win one, but didn't. Anyway, I might get him the robot version, whether he likes it or not. Either that or the brilliant little Wallace and Gromit car from the new film.</p><p>Although our children are as idle as the next man's, they will kick a football around the field and - living as we do in England's windiest town - we might occasionally think about putting a kite in the air. Still outdoors, I have been thinking of getting them a trampoline, which last summer was voted the gift most likely to put your child into casualty for the afternoon.</p><p>Most weekends, though, at least two of ours - sometimes three - will be making as much noise as they can on electric guitars, keyboards and drums. I'm not sure how they can make it worse, but Santa Claus should expect requests for distortion pedals and bigger amps. My advice to him would be to bring them a selection of educational reading material instead.</p><p><strong>Helen Seamons </strong><br />Beauty editor </p><p>I can think of nothing better on Christmas morning than unwrapping a series of perfectly packaged cosmetic treats. Nothing. I don't particularly lust after new technology, or want money in a card, but nothing is as satisfying as opening luxurious pampering products.</p><p>I've been this way ever since I received a Fame! make-up kit for Christmas when I was seven. It included shimmer nail varnish that I rationed so fiercely it finally turned solid in the bottle, unfeasible amounts of face glitter that left their mark on everything, and garish face paints in red, white and black. I'm pretty sure the latter induced quite a severe allergic reaction - and they certainly did nothing to complement my stripy legwarmers.</p><p>These days, I'm more discerning, but the Hot and Flashy body lotion would make it into my bathroom without question. In fact, I'd welcome almost any Benefit product. I love the antique bottles from Liberty, which are nicely grown-up, and while Prada body lotion may be expensive, the scent is divine and lasts all day. My penchant for eye make-up in primary colours has luckily moved on since the glory of Fame! These days, the subtle Stila winter trio is much more my poison.</p><p><strong>Martin Love </strong><br />Motoring editor</p><p>Men are supposedly hard to buy for. Givers panic that the basics (slippers, soap) show a lack of imagination; 'novelty' gags (cartoon boxers, personalised socks) are inappropriate; superannuated 'boys toys' (remote-control cars, jukeboxes which dispense jellybeans) are immature, and executive trinkets (anything shiny or black) are boring. In fact, men are happy with any/all of these offerings. The secret is simply to tell us that they're just what we've always wanted.</p><p>There are, however, dead certs which, money permitting, do not need any donor spin. Starting at the top is this scooter. The Honda Zoomer is the grown-up version of the monkey bikes we used to hanker after as kids. To complete the look, a biker jacket from Belstaff makes us feel less like we're having a mid-life crisis - and will still look great long after the bike's been stolen.</p><p>Every man has always wanted a guitar - and if we're going to look the part, we'll need new jeans and a rock'n'roll T-shirt, too. As for gadgets to keep us occupied in the lull after Christmas lunch, think small and slick. The best options are: a Navman; a Leica digital camera or a handheld PSP. And, as the gentlest hint, a pair of seasonal scales to help us shift that festive fat.</p><p><strong>Fiona Rattray </strong><br />Style editor For the indecisive gift-buyer, Christmas is murder. I have no problem finding things I want to buy for myself (and usually do, which is why it costs me a fortune), but for other people? Hell no. How are you supposed to know what anyone else wants for their home? The fear of rejection - the wine glasses left unpacked, the candlestick that's straight off to the charity shop the minute the high street reopens - is crippling. Far better to umm and ahh, then run round in a blind panic at the last minute grabbing things you'd already rejected...</p><p>But this year, I've confronted those nasty seasonal demons for your benefit. I thought hard about what people (oh all right, I) would really, really want, and these are the things at the top of my list.</p><p>If you have an eye for colour, a pretty cushion is a lovely gift, and anyone would make room on their sofa for Salvor's zebra.I wouldn't normally suggest furniture as a gift, but this Habitat stool - designed by Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad - is a bargain, a future classic, and a lovely splash of colour. And George Nelson's multicoloured Sunburst wallclock meets the golden rule of gift-buying: if it makes you smile just to look at it, it's a winner.</p><p><strong>Marie O'Riordan </strong><br />Relationship columnist</p><p>It is a terrible truism that gift-buying for your other half can be a relationship deal-breaker. The item is a declaration of intent - the giver is either here to play, stay or is in the departure lounge. It is a way of communicating your unique connection - the ideal gift is one that says, 'He/ she is the only one who knows the real me.'</p><p>While men across the land will guffaw, buying for a woman is so simple there is no reason for the inevitable sighting of men at the perfume counter on Christmas Eve. The failsafe is jewellery or a great handbag. Always get a second opinion from another female. Men, though, are a nightmare. I'll never forget my boyfriend's disappointment when he opened his portable record player the year everyone else was receiving iPods.</p><p>The following year I was more popular by combining his two favourite things in the world - Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall and fishing - with a voucher for a 'catch and cook' day out.</p><p>Presents you can share are always a winner. Not many shout 'togetherness' louder than a tandem or a weekend break. My all-time favourite gift is a charm bracelet full of charms to which he constantly adds. A perennial, as it were.

We describe the modern world as interdependent. We acknowledge the force of globalisation. But we fail to follow through the logic of these realities in global politics.<P>Nations are deeply connected at every level. Of course, economically, but also now through communication, travel and technology. Yesterday, by chance, I watched part of the MTV Music Awards. Well, it was certainly the most relaxed part of the week I just had. I recommend it to any person who wants to understand modern politics. Why? There was no politics discussed. But the fusion of sounds, rhythms and musical influences from vastly different cultures was an allegory for today's world and the context in which politics exists. This is a world integrating at a fast rate, with enormous economic, cultural and political consequences.<P>And it all happens as a result of what people themselves are doing. Occasionally we debate globalisation as if it were something imposed by governments or business on unwilling people. Wrong. It is the individual decisions of millions of people that is creating and driving globalisation. Globalisation isn't something done to us. It is something we are, consciously or unconsciously doing to and for ourselves.<P>But, of course, it has a number of effects. People want to consume more and get higher economic growth. Pressure grows on energy supply. As the global financial markets become bigger and reach out further, so the confidence on which they rest becomes simultaneously more powerful and more vulnerable to anything that destroys that confidence.<P>Political causes, even, become more readily raised, communicated and agitated about. Sometimes, as with Make Poverty History, this is entirely benign. But it can mean media focus determines saliency and under pressure, political decision-making.<P>You can summons hundreds of thousands out on the street to protest against America. But how many placards do you see highlighting the plight of the oppressed in the numerous dictatorships that still exist, where people suffer grievously but where, since there are no cameras, there is no demonstration? In other cases, globalisation means the cause of extremism can be fanned through the thoroughly malign use of modern communication.<P>What I am saying is that out of this great pumping up of global integration, comes the need for stronger and more effective global, multilateral action. There is a real danger that the institutions of global politics lag seriously behind the challenges they are called upon to resolve.<P>These challenges are pressing. The most obvious is global terrorism. Barely a week goes by without another country being added to the grieving list of victims. Jordan, Egypt, Indonesia, India and of course here in London. Recently, in Australia, it appears an attack was foiled.<P>We have disrupted two groups planning attacks here in the UK since July 7 alone. What is obvious now to all is that this is a global movement and requires global action in response, of which the successful completion of a democratic process in Afghanistan and Iraq is a major component. So is the push for peace between Israel and Palestine.<P>In all of these conflicts, the only successful solution is based on democratic consent; and success would have a tremendous persuasive effect far beyond the frontiers of the countries concerned.<P>Similarly, with the challenge of climate change, the world has to act together. After Gleneagles we began the G8 + 5 talks with the first meeting in London on November 1.<P>The commitment period under the Kyoto protocol ends in 2012. We urgently need a framework, with the necessary targets, sensitively and intelligently applied over the right timeframe, that takes us beyond 2012.<P>It can only happen if the US, China and India join with Europe, Japan and others to create such a framework.<P>Failure will mean not only increasing the damage to the environment but in a world of greater competition for carbon fuel, real pressure on energy supply and energy prices.<P>Yet such an agreement cannot materialise without the major nations of the world agreeing an approach that is fair and balanced, sharing the most advanced science and technology to tackle carbon emissions.<P>In other words, a just settlement as well as an effective one.<P>And we surely know already that if we leave millions of the world's poorest out of the onward march of global prosperity, we do not merely indicate moral indifference, but commit a foolish betrayal of our own long-term interest.<P>I want to concentrate tonight on another example: trade.<P>The challenge is clear - can we make trade work for all of us; or do we continue with a system with 2 billion locked out of prosperity and denied a chance to work their way out of poverty. This is a test for all of us. A test of our commitment to make globalisation work. A test of our global leadership.<P>At Gleneagles we showed the world - and the world's poor - that political leaders in rich countries not only care about world poverty, but are capable of acting together to help eliminate it. Of course we could have done more, but we showed that cooperation can deliver results.<P>If we follow through the gains made at Gleneagles then 13,000 people who die preventable deaths every day will be saved. Some 600,000 African children who would have died from malaria will live. Six million Africans will get anti-Aids drugs within the next five years. Polio should now be eradicated. Twenty million more children will go to school. Five million more orphans will be cared for.<P>The challenge now is to extend that principle of cooperation into the multilateral trading system - and that is what the Doha Development round is about.<P>Sometimes I worry that we lose sight of what is at stake.<P>Of course trade ministers are there to negotiate. And of course the problems raised in the trade negotiations are difficult. But the Doha round is an opportunity to tackle some of the most fundamental injustices at the heart of world trade - an opportunity to create the conditions in which millions of people will have a chance to escape poverty.<P>Ultimately, agriculture accounts for under 2% of the GDP of rich countries and roughly the same share of employment. Can we afford to allow differences over support for agriculture in rich countries to block an agreement that could give renewed hope to the 1 in 5 people in the world living on less than $1 a day? And can we afford to weaken an international trading system on which future employment and prosperity in rich countries depends?<P>The benefits of a successful round are: For the poor: we know a one per cent increase in Africa's share of world trade will benefit Africa by over $70bn, three times the aid increase agreed at Gleneagles. For ourselves: it will not just be the poor countries of the world who will benefit from an comprehensive and ambitious Doha round. From Non-Agricultural Market Access alone, Europe could gain 20bn euros a year.<P>For large developing countries of the G20, including Brazil and India and the Cairns Group, including Australia, New Zealand and Canada - they will get improved market access to sell agricultural goods, to the EU, to the US and to each other.<P>And we benefit multilateralism itself: in trade, possibly more than in any other area of international cooperation, we have a rules-based system. There are some who argue that the poor will lose from an ambitious liberalising round. Far better to continue to offer them preferences - an old form of welfare. In one sense they are right. In the short term they may loose from some changes to the preference system if we do not take other actions. But ultimately the preference system is not the way forward. They stand to gain far more if we are bold; if we are confident; if we are ambitious.<P>Developing countries could gain $47bn in increased agricultural exports.<P>We know the current system of preferences is not helping Africa. African trade with the EU has fallen over thirty years under the Lome and Cotonou Preferences. We also do not give enough market access to larger developing countries including countries like Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa who are not LDCs. Yet the blunt reality is that it is they who will drive African economic recovery.<P>And most of the world's poor live in India and China. They will benefit from an ambitious trade deal too.<P>This, then, is the vision. But Hong Kong will be upon us in a month. Because everyone wants someone else to move first nobody has moved far enough and the talks seem to have stalled.<P>The US President recently threw down the gauntlet to the rest of the world in his speech to the UN in which he called for the removal of all agricultural and industrial subsidies, and said the US would do it if other countries did too. We must take up this plea and answer it.<P>We need a comprehensive, ambitious agreement to cut barriers to trade in the three key areas: agriculture, non-agricultural market access, and services. The aim of Hong Kong has to be to create the conditions whereby, by the end of 2006 we can get there.<P>To break the logjam, the EU and the US must go further, within the negotiations, on agriculture. We must reduce trade distorting subsidies; we must see a credible end date for export subsidies; we must put an ambitious limit on the number of sensitive products that can be afforded extra protection. In return Brazil, India and others must move on cuts in industrial tariffs, services liberalisation, with proper flexibility for developing countries that need to sequence their commitments in line with their development needs.<P>We need specific measures for the poorest including: <b>&#183; </b>doubling investment in infrastructure <br> <b>&#183; </b>eliminating all forms of export subsidies <br> <b>&#183; </b>providing strong special and differential treatment, to give them flexibility to make their own development choices <br> <b>&#183; </b>providing complete market access for LDCs to all rich country markets, as the EU has already offered <br> <b>&#183; </b>taking strong action on commodities of special importance to poor countries, like cotton and sugar <br> <b>&#183; </b>simplifying the rules applied to exports from the poorest developing countries. <br><br><P>This will cut red tape for you too.<P>The European Commission committed in Gleneagles to increase aid for trade to 1bn euros a year. EU Member States are currently looking at matching that collectively with another 1 bn euros a year. This evening I can announce the UK will contribute a major share of that: to treble aid for trade to &#163;100m a year by 2010. And I challenge other G8 countries to follow this lead and an announce increases in their aid for trade ahead of the meetings in Hong Kong next month. Let us recall the moment when the round was launched. Two months after terrorists crashed planes into buildings in New York and Washington DC, trade negotiators had the courage to gather at Doha because it was important that the world showed to those who perpetrated that evil, that we would not be bowed.<P>The Doha trade round is absolutely central to showing that the world has the capacity to confront its multilateral challenges with the necessary unity of purpose and overcome them.<P>The last trade round added $500bn to world GDP. Forget the statistic. Measure it in jobs, living standards and increased opportunities and it is vast. Pascal Lamy, Head of the WTO and whose ambitions for this round we should fully support, estimates that success in cutting trade barriers by a third would boost the world economy by almost $600bn. And he rightly emphasises the urgency of the task since the present US presidential mandate on trade expires in 2007.<P>But agreement on trade is also a metaphor for today's world. Trade increases prosperity. Prosperity gives people and nations a stake in the future. Such a stake shows how we gain by helping and not harming each other. At some point, we will have to return to the issue of UN reform and how we create the right institutional capability to handle global challenges. But in the meantime, at least let us send a clear statement of our determination to shape events not be overwhelmed by them.<P>Global terrorism can be defeated but only by the ideas of democracy, tolerance and freedom as well as hunting down those that murder, without limit, the innocent.<P>Climate change needs economic growth to be sustainable in its environmental effects, but no agreement will be effective unless it recognises that developing nations need to grow.<P>Global poverty in Africa will be fought not just by aid but by good governance, the absence of corruption and an end to the ravages of unnecessary conflict.<P>And the world trade round embodies the hope that we can at least see past a narrow view of self-interest to a more enlightened view that comprehends more trade means more help to the poorest, more prosperity to be shared amongst the wealthy, more reasons for people to see that justice for all, not divisions whether by faith, race or nation, is the only rational course in today's world.<P>In a modern world there is no security or prosperity at home unless we deal with the global challenges of conflict, terrorism, climate change and poverty. Self interest and mutual interest are inextricably linked. National interests can best be advanced through collective action.<P>Calculate not just the human misery of the poor themselves. Calculate our loss: the aid, the lost opportunity to trade, the short-term consequences of the multiple conflicts; the long-term consequences on the attitude to the wealthy world of injustice and abject deprivation amongst the poor. We will reap what we sow; live with what we do not act to change.<P>Here, in the City of London, which makes its living above all by being the meeting point of many nations; and which through trade, creates much of the wealth on which this British nation depends, is a good place for this call to action. So let us act."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/nov/15/development.internationalaidanddevelopment1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2005/nov/15/development.internationalaidanddevelopment1","sectionName":"Politics"},{"webTitle":"A meeting of minds in the desert","webPublicationDate":"2005-11-15T00:44:36Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2005/nov/15/elearning.technology14","fields":{"body":"<p>E-ducation without borders - an all-embracing theme, suggesting idealism, world visions, a slice of best practice and (dare I say it) a few doses of hot air - was the focus of an intense three-day Middle East e-learning conference earlier this year that was anything but normal.</p><p>Unlike any average event, it was held in a brand new &pound;2bn conference centre cum royal palace cum hotel, which opened up its doors, heavy pile carpets and liveried footmen to around 1,000 students from 89 countries and a bevy of top international e-learning academics in the United Arab Emirates' capital, Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Mix in an ex-US astronaut, a couple of Nobel prize-winners, a European orchestra and two chart-busting pop groups specially flown in from Europe and you can picture a unique, no expense spared event, laced with generous Arab hospitality, financed by the Emirates government and designed to put the UAE firmly on the e-learning map.</p><p><strong>Run by students</strong></p><p>The conference was unusual in another way - it was run by students for students. A 28-strong international student panel had spent almost two years compiling the programme, inviting speakers and sifting through hundreds of student papers to shortlist the best for live presentation and entry for best paper awards at the conference itself. Abu Dhabi Men's College handled much of the logistical organisation.</p><p>While key e-learning issues were being thrashed out in debates facilitated by the UK's Oxford Union, the quality of many papers presented elsewhere was surprising the experts. Standards were sky-high, according to the lone British academic on the speakers' programme, Gilly Salmon, professor of e-learning and learning technologies at Leicester University.</p><p>Commenting on papers presented at a workshop on equal e-learning access for all, she says: \"I've never heard anything like it. The students were fantastic. One guy was looking at e-learning for the inuits. He had a fantastic research project and was actually doing it. There was a young African woman who was looking at e-learning in schools in Kenya and I'd think she's a leader of the future. She'd done the research, worked out what it was about, then she actually lobbied her government and people like Unesco to try to make them understand the issues.\"</p><p>But Salmon reserves her fullest praise for an eventual award-winner, Angela Engel, a blind student from Austria, who was researching how websites can help the visually impaired: \"I learned so much from her in half an hour that I didn't know before. She delivered in PowerPoint, despite the fact she couldn't see it.\"</p><p>\"If you'd seen any of these papers at a conference elsewhere, they would have just blown the audience away. I see hundreds of conference presentations and it was as good as it gets. They were well-written, well-presented, had really substantive stuff and, most importantly, the students were not only doing it but trying to understand how to influence others.\"</p><p>The ethos behind the conference was extremely powerful, she says. It was \"giving students - mostly PhD-type students - the chance to expose their work in a forum\".</p><p>Whether the standard would have been so high without the Emirates' financial clout to bring all these students together is another matter, for the conference budget neatly reflected the \"without borders\" theme. Leading academics and thinkers from across the globe were brought in, many of them put up at the Emirates Palace Hotel conference centre itself in rooms normally costing from around &pound;300 a night. In a state-of-the-art auditorium able to seat some 5,000 delegates, speaker after distinguished speaker gave their views on the future of the internet, the digital divide, global citizenship ...</p><p>A few were up in the stratosphere, positing vague theories about e-learning's role in society, some were \"gung-ho\" about the limitless use we could make of technology, while others, thankfully, brought the audience down to earth, highlighting the danger of too much unfettered, unchallenged information being misinterpreted and causing chaos at all levels, fomenting political extremism or, at worst, terrorism.</p><p>The BBC's Nik Gowing from the World Service underlined the fickle nature of the web. \"Seventy-five per cent of information is coming from the net, only 15% from TV. The challenge is how to gate-keep, to discriminate and to know how good that information is. It's not just the press, radio, TV, but every form of transmission by whoever has the means. All of you are now a member of the 'media'. You watch us because you expect us to do the gatekeeping.\"</p><p>He also queried the power of blogging. \"We now get 'bloggers' breakfasts', when bloggers can turn up as journalists,\" he said, warning that many people had been sacked from their jobs because of misrepresentation on blogs.</p><p>Several speakers stressed the need for face-to-face interaction as an essential part of distant learning. Dr Howard Rundle, from Fanshawe College, Ontario, Canada, warned: \"People aged 17 or 18 don't want to be isolated but want contact with professionals and to be with other students. We have been offering business learning programme in rural areas and we've made sure there's a place in their own region where they can meet someone in person (learning coaches) to offer encouragement.\"</p><p>And the results of a conference survey showed a majority of students present wanted face-to-face interaction to remain an integral part of their studies.</p><p><strong>Strong arguments</strong></p><p>But the arguments for increasing e-learning are strong and well-known. Charles Wankel, associate professor at St John's University, New York, added a new twist: \"We're finding students doing their business masters degree totally online are getting many times the job offers of students who physically attend the university.\"</p><p>The conference was closed as it was opened by the Emirates education minister, HE Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan, who told the Guardian how much his government valued technology in learning: \"IT has empowered students to have access to all information and broken the monopoly &#91;of&#93; academia. You change your institution from an education to a learning institution, so students are responsible for their learning rather than waiting for the teacher to pass on information. Now that students can see other opinions, no one has control of knowledge. Because of technology, it has limited the power of oppression in governments and made the student more aware of the world.\"</p><p>The minister said Emirati women in particular were benefiting. \"There's no future for any nation that keeps half its population idle,\" he said, adding that the Emirates sent more girls to study abroad than boys, and women students outnumbered men at the United Arab Emirates University. The question now is how far will they have progressed by the next conference planned for 2007?</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/nov/15/elearning.technology14","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2005/nov/15/elearning.technology14","sectionName":"Education"},{"webTitle":"A good man in Africa","webPublicationDate":"2005-11-13T13:33:08Z","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","id":"lifeandstyle/2005/nov/13/foodanddrink.features10","fields":{"body":"<p>The first time I saw Andrew Rugasira was in a riverside room at the House of Lords.</p><p>It was a bright June afternoon, and people were out on a balcony over the Thames, sipping the coffee Rugasira had begun to import into Britain from Uganda. For once, Africa was on everyone's mind. Live8 and the summit of world leaders at Gleneagles was a fortnight away. Sir Bob Geldof had the previous night filled TV screens in his bright blue headscarf.</p><p>At the House of Lords half the invited guests were politicians and Africa-watchers, the rest were from Africa. Midway through the afternoon Rugasira, who is 36, addressed this audience without notes and with great charisma. Beside him, as he spoke, was a poster with the slogan 'Trade Not Aid'. Rugasira had a vision of a different Africa to the one that we had been hearing about from politicians and rock stars. Certainly there was poverty, but there was poverty in many places in the world. Certainly there were corrupt governments, but Africa did not have a monopoly on those. He did not come from a continent just of begging bowls and distended stomachs, but a place of tremendous opportunity and resourcefulness. 'We are ready for business,' he said. 'All I want is the same opportunity to trade that British entrepreneurs have when they come to my county.'</p><p>He gave some figures. One of them stuck in my head. If Africa were able to increase its trade with the world by just two per cent it would produce $150 billion of wealth. Mr Geldof, said Rugasira, should not be lobbying governments to increase their aid budgets and create further chronic dependency, he should be lobbying Tesco to make two per cent of its shelf space available for quality goods from African enterprises.</p><p>Rugasira expanded on this theme with passion and good humour. And he knew what he was talking about. He had recently won the first contract for any African producer of coffee to sell direct to a British supermarket. The first. It had not been easy. He had to jump through hoops and make guarantees that no other producer would have dreamed of. He had limited capital, no one would lend him anything, but he also had 11,000 peasant farmers in the Rwenzori Mountains, the Mountains of the Moon, who were producing coffee for him and with whom he shared his profit 50:50. This was their vision, he suggested, as much as his own.</p><p>After his speech a big queue of people formed around Rugasira, wanting to hear more of his story. Later that week I heard him again, a couple of times, spreading the word on the radio and on television. During Live8 he watched in his hotel room as much as he could bear of Madonna and Snoop Dogg singing to save Africa, then went shopping. He wrote a couple of leading articles in newspapers, was invited up to Gleneagles to address business leaders and politicians. He tried to have a brief chat with Geldof himself at a reception, but Sir Bob had far too many important things on his mind to listen.</p><p>At the end of that week I drove out to my local Waitrose at Swiss Cottage in north London on an extremely short and particularly easy pilgrimage. I scoured the shelves and bought some packs of Andrew Rugasira's Good African Coffee. I took it home. It tasted great.</p><p>A couple of months after that I was sitting in the back of a Land Rover with Rugasira driving high into the Mountains of the Moon. The Land Rover was climbing apparently vertically in the absence of anything resembling a road. Alongside us among rows of coffee plants, children and toddlers, naked and in rags, would emerge from time to time to wave and wonder what all the noise was about. Not without some justification, given the precariousness of the incline, Rugasira sat reading to himself from the Book of Revelations.</p><p>The Rwenzori Mountains are on the extreme western edge of Uganda, forming part of the border with Congo, near the heart of the continent. We were a rough eight-hour drive from Kampala. Gleneagles, the House of Lords and Waitrose seemed a very long way away. Looking out at the coffee fields, thinking about the summer, I had the feeling of having been transported from what the economists call the macro to the micro, from one end of the world's telescope to the other.</p><p>For the past couple of days we had been up in the mountains, which ultimately rise to snow-capped peaks of 15,000 feet, talking to farmers who had long coped cheerfully with lives that hardly bore thinking about. They had welcomed us into huts made of stone and mud, a single room often housing six or seven children. They had told me how they went to bed at dusk because there was no light or candles. How their children in their bright pink or yellow cotton uniforms took empty jerry cans on their two-hour walks to school in the mornings and carried them back filled with water in the hot afternoons. For at least a couple of decades, until quite recently, these families had been periodically terrorised by soldiers of different persuasions, under Amin and Obote, and subsequently by incursions of rebels from the Congo. They had not starved, since they could always grow more than enough to eat on some of the most fertile land in the world, but that is about all they had done. For the first time, some of them said, they felt able to look to the future with some sense of hope.</p><p>Andrew Rugasira began his coffee business out here three years ago by first talking to the farmers. No one, they had been telling me, had ever bothered to do that before, to come up here. They were very suspicious - there had to be a catch - but they gave him the data he wanted: the acreage of their land; the average yield; the number of kids they supported; how much schools cost and so on. The average plot was one acre. An acre produced roughly 300 kilos of coffee per season. Some seasons they were getting about 50p for a kilo of raw coffee, which they sold to 'middle men', agents for the big coffee corporations, in town; some seasons they got less.</p><p>'The more we discovered,' Rugasira explains, his bible on his lap, 'the more we saw how an intervention by our company could bring about an improvement in the life of a farmer by paying him a better price for his crop, but also in creating something for him within his community.'</p><p>The first thing he had wanted to do was to change the method by which coffee was produced. The farmers were using a 'dry' process that was archaic and cumbersome; the value of the 'dry' processed arabicas was much less than the 'wet' processed. 'So,' he says, 'we thought it would be a good project for the farmers to shift to that, to produce a good quality of coffee and get a better price.'</p><p>Rugasira and his local team proposed to the farmers that they organised themselves into associations, 50 farmers in each. A group would elect its own leadership and the leaders would be trained in the new technology and would educate their group; they would be provided with hand-cranked pulping machines that remove the skin from the red coffee 'cherry' - the first piece of mechanised equipment they had ever used. In return for adopting Rugasira's more efficient methods, the Rwenzori Finest Coffee Company would pay them about double the price they had been getting for their coffee in a good year.</p><p>Hearing this the farmers' suspicions grew. They had always got the rawest of deals. They were at the primary end of a value chain and they had never felt part of any process at all. Many of them had never even tasted coffee. A few were under the impression that the beans they produced were used in some way as bullets by the arms industry. Rugasira is a persuasive man, however, and patiently he sold them his idea.</p><p>It had, he explains, as the Land Rover crunches through its gears, been a rewarding relationship on both sides. This morning he wants me to meet one of the people he has been most inspired by, a widow called Milenai Muhindo. He talks of her, as he talks of all the farmers, as a partner in his enterprise. 'She's quite a remarkable woman,' he tells me. 'Strong. You'll like her.'</p><p>Milenai Muhindo has lived in her vertiginous house for 22 years, nearly all her adult life. She has two rooms. In her living room a pair of ancient sofas face each other, both covered daintily with lace. On the wall there are two posters. One praises the Lord's mercy, the other warns of the horror of abusing children.</p><p>She sits on a chair and welcomes us with some warmth. When I start to ask her about her life she talks quietly and precisely, her hands loose in her lap, adding one detail carefully to the next.</p><p>About five years ago, she explains, her husband died from cancer at the age of 42. She pauses. Then, she goes on, three days after her husband was buried rebels came from over the mountains and killed three of her four brothers with machetes, and left their bodies out at the back of her house with the rubbish. She pauses again. They stole all of her savings, and they destroyed her house. When they left they kidnapped two of her children and took them off to the mountains. The children escaped from their captors and returned home some months later.</p><p>She sits still, rests her fingertips on the table. I am not sure quite what to say. I look at the posters on her wall. I ask her how she went about rebuilding her life.</p><p>In reply she goes into her back room and returns with a small school exercise book in which she has detailed in careful pencil all of the basins of coffee she has harvested and sold. A basin is about 10 kilos. She sold 34 basins in the last harvest. She works the land herself, she says, and carries the coffee a good way down the mountain on her back. To rebuild her house, she managed to secure a loan for a corrugated iron roof; by putting just a little by she had now paid off the loan.</p><p>She felt her experience of saving for the roof was something she could share with some of the many other widows in the area. Every Thursday, she says, smiling a bit, about 50 of them now get together for their savings club. Everyone has to bring something, even if it is 100 shillings (about three pence). She has another exercise book in which she keeps track of the money the group has collected in this way. So far they have saved nearly &pound;600.</p><p>I wonder what she will do with her part of the money. She says she wants her children to do what she did not manage: to study, to finish their education at school. She prays for this.</p><p>As she talks her neighbours come into her room, the trainer of her farmers' group, a co-ordinator, a secretary. They sit wedged side by side on a sofa - small, stout men. They haggle and banter with Rugasira, wondering about price, still a bit unsure of the new deal.</p><p>Rugasira worries that the ripe coffee he has seen outside is not being harvested. 'Milenai your coffee cherries are ripe, they are going to start getting rotten,' he says.</p><p>She says she knows, but there is only so much she can do.</p><p>He wonders how much it costs to hire someone to help?</p><p>She tells him and he peels off some notes. 'I think you have 30 basins ready to collect,' he says. 'I'll loan you this money to hire labour. When you have harvested the coffee you can pay me back and invest some of the profit with your association.'</p><p>Milenai has him make a note of this in her ledger, smiles and says she will get some help this morning and be down with her coffee in a week.</p><p>On the way back to the car Rugasira talks about his desire among other things to bring in financial advisers here, to talk about savings. 'Of course,' he says, 'I could just give her the money. There was a time when I would have done that. Instead I make a contribution, a loan against her profits and the money eventually supports her association. I'm not doing it out of pity. I am investing in her. She will bring me good coffee. She has been worrying about her harvest and now she will be able to collect it.'</p><p>The most important thing for him is to know what is happening on each of these farms, he says. 'You can't do everything but you can promote examples of excellence, and that will spread. Leadership is all about knowledge.'</p><p>Rugasira has read many business books. His talk is rich with quotes from Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric, about valuing your best people. From the head of Samsung, on the importance of research and development. 'The principles are the same for Samsung or for GE as for here,' he suggests. Even so, he believes the most useful book he has is The Making of the English Working Class. 'That is about where these people are now.' When he works out his equations between profits and investment in his farmers he thinks of models like Cadbury in Bournville. 'You do it because it is good for business and good for the people. We do not want to be a charity. These are resourceful, hardworking, wonderful people. They just need someone to have a bit of faith, give them an opportunity.'</p><p>Back in the car, as we drive on to the next farm, he returns to Revelations.</p><p>The Rwenzori Finest Coffee Company has an office in Kampala but it is really based in Kasese in the foothills of the mountains. Kasese is a frontier town, with a single Wild West main street on which big lorries from the Congo and roaring buses and the air-conditioned SUVs of NGO workers and hundreds of bikes and pedestrians compete for every inch of space. The hotel where we are staying is filled with a Flemish TV crew who are making a reality show about famous Belgians trying to survive in an African mountain village.</p><p>The day we arrive is the first day the Coffee Company has been open for the farmers to bring in their harvested, wet processed crop. A few turn up with sacks on the back of bicycles, or piled on shared, hired pick-ups; the coffee is sorted on UN tarpaulins on the ground outside and weighed. In the Rwenzori office Andrew Rugasira's team sit around a table discussing a new training initiative. One of them, Janet Maate, who is 22, and could be mistaken for a young boy, grew up in Kasese and is Rugasira's main liaison with the farmers. I ask her what the farmers make of her boss, what the gossip is about him. She thinks for a moment. 'They believe he has been sent here by God,' she says, simply.</p><p>It is part of Janet's job to get messages out to the farmers on the local radio station, Grace FM, which has a ramshackle studio in Kasese's main street. The message tonight is that the office is open for business and the price is guaranteed. While Janet jots down a few notes for her broadcast, I ask her how she came to be working here. Like many of Rugasira's employees, her CV is not a conventional one.</p><p>Janet had left school to work as a warden in the neighbouring Queen Elizabeth Game Reserve, she explains. She had worked there for a year or so when one evening she accepted a ride home on the back of a colleague's motorbike. As they reached a bridge she saw three lions blocking their path. In a panic her colleague stalled, leapt from his bike and tried to climb a tree. The lions chased him, and savaged his leg before he fell into a thorn bush too dense for them to reach him. Janet was left on the road, and the lions turned on her.</p><p>As she recalls this, for the thousandth time, she looks as wide-eyed as she must have been back then. She bites her lip a little before she goes on in a rush.</p><p>'I thought,' she says, 'am I just going to die here? I sat down folded my arms around my knees. Immediately I sat down a lioness entered the gulley by the side of the road where I was. It looked at me. I eyed it back. It looked at me. I eyed it. The third time it came it roared, like a noise I had never heard. I willed myself not to feel fear. I knew that lions never ate dead meat so I made sure I did not move one muscle. It roared and I did not shake. It roared and it was too, too loud and I said to God, \"I know you are going to get me from this place,\" and prayed that I would not move. The other two lions came across. The previous Sunday I had spoken in church for the first time. I wondered if the Lord had not liked the way I had done it. My mind was working like crazy but I was sitting very still. I waited there five minutes and the lion came in front again to see if this person was alive or dead. I kept staring into its eyes, trying not to blink. I could feel its breath on my face for one maybe two minutes. Eventually, the lion moved a little way off and it lay down with the others. I sat like that for two hours.'</p><p>Finally a ranger came by on the road and cocked his gun at the lions and they ran off. He thought Janet and her colleague were poachers and threatened to shoot. She had to shout in the dark to explain. She then helped to carry her friend back to a village where she borrowed a bicycle. The ranger took another and they rode like that with the injured man between them until they found a car and took him to the hospital.</p><p>Janet pauses. 'That night has not left me,' she says. 'When I close my eyes sometimes I am back on that road. And when it gets to six in the evening I won't be outside on my own any more. But anyway that is how I came to work here. I left my job and I told Mr Andrew my story, and he took me on.'</p><p>It's getting near six now, and I walk with Janet to the radio station. She haggles fiercely with the broadcaster over the price of her slot and then wanders into the studio and delivers, with the same intensity she has just displayed to me, a long and brilliant monologue about the virtues of the Rwenzori Finest Coffee Company, of the imperative of farmers coming to sell their coffee and of the bright future they can make for themselves - all the time slipping easily between the local language and English.</p><p>Walking back with her, I say how impressed I was with her broadcast; how she seems to really believe in the value of what she is doing.</p><p>She replies with a phrase I have heard from others on the Rwenzori staff as well as from a couple of farmers in the mountains: 'We are all doing our level best.'</p><p>The next morning a woman comes in to clean my hotel room. 'Ah,' she says, 'I hear Miss Janet talk about your coffee company on the radio last night. You are doing good work for our people.'</p><p>I explain to her that the coffee company is not mine, it belongs to Mr Rugasira, who is also staying at the hotel. She is having none of it though. Coffee companies don't belong to Ugandans, they belong to white Europeans, to muzungus.</p><p>When I mention this story to Rugasira over breakfast he laughs, says it is a common mistake, just one of the preconceptions he has to deal with. He moves very easily between the two worlds he inhabits; he seems as comfortable in the company of the farmers of Kasese as he did in the House of Lords. He has, he explains, the great advantage of being educated both in Uganda and in England, and he never forgets his luck.</p><p>Rugasira grew up in Kampala. His father had a factory which sold chalk to schools. Throughout the Amin years there was a lot of insecurity. Then, when Milton Obote came to power his soldiers came to the Rugasira home and his father was taken and locked up for 18 months. 'In a sense,' Rugasira recalls, 'that was fortunate because there was so much indiscriminate killing going on. My mum kept things going. The business was closed, but my mum started it up again.'</p><p>I wonder if it was possible to have any proper childhood?</p><p>'In a strange kind of way it was,' he suggests. 'Everyone was touched by the violence. I lost a lot of relatives - uncles, aunties. The soldiers would come down the street and loot all the homes, but as terrifying as it was, we felt lucky - our father was alive, even if in prison.'</p><p>Rugasira and his four sisters were sent away to school in England. He went to a place in Box Hill in Surrey then to another outside Shrewsbury. In 1989 he went to the School of Oriental and African Studies at London University to study law and economics. He became politicised and joined anti-apartheid protests with his South African friends. He took an obsessive interest in the Pan-African movement, the lives of Nkrumah and Nasser, the struggle in Mozambique and South Africa; knowing all the time that these conflicts would underscore the future.</p><p>He never considered it an option not to come back to Kampala. 'I knew that whatever I learned would be much more useful in Uganda than in economies that were more developed. When I came back my father was unwell and he died in 1993.' Suddenly he was head of the family, which means a great deal in Uganda, and almost immediately he had a major decision to make. 'At the time when I took over the chalk business, markets were liberalised and cheap imports flooded in from China and Kenya. Within a year I could see we would not compete and we had to close. Everyone, all my father's friends and colleagues, thought: \"This is what happens when you educate children abroad. They close down their father's businesses.\"'</p><p>Instead he started up a company which did events management and marketing. He brought in African music stars from South Africa; the high point was to organise Bill Clinton's visit to Uganda in 1998.</p><p>His aim all the while was to close the gap between international standards of business and African standards: seeing the White House operation up close, a five day trip which cost $45 million Rugasira saw what he was up against. But he was not daunted.</p><p>'I was brought up with a strong sense that as Africans we were not inferior. We might not have the same opportunity but we were as able, as energetic, as dynamic as anybody else. And we could define our own opportunities.'</p><p>Always at the back of his mind was the idea that he should do something with agriculture. He could never understand, with Uganda's black soil, its weather and its greenness, how it seemed incapable of harnessing these natural resources to its own benefit.</p><p>About five years ago he was doing some marketing consultancy in South Africa for Shoprite, the biggest supermarket chain in the continent. He was talking to the CEO about why there were no African coffee products on their shelves. Eventually, Rugasira made the man - and himself - believe that he was the person who could put it there.</p><p>He had little experience of coffee - beyond a taste for it - but he knew there was a marketing angle for a Good African Coffee, because there was so little intra-African trade. If he could find a roaster he knew he could develop a product.</p><p>When he came to Rwenzori, he could see how he could also use that product to develop a community. Rugasira had long had a social commitment. He was married in 1997 and had the first of his four children in 1998, but by then, he says, he was already beginning to lose count of the number of children he was looking after who were linked to him in one way or another: children of his aunts and uncles who he educated; children in orphanages who he supported, children who cane through the evangelical church which had become a part of his life. When he was organising concerts the front couple of rows would always be orphans or children from the blind and deaf schools that he worked with.</p><p>'I'm not special in that regard,' he says. 'When you see what is around you here, you cannot not try to help. If you look at the history of capitalism, social responsibility has often been a hallmark. It is part of the same interest.'</p><p>I ask if all the poverty he encounters makes him angry.</p><p>'I used to get very angry. Now I am more pragmatic about what I can do.'</p><p>One of the things he has done is to adopt a child, Jonathan, who was left on a rubbish tip outside Kampala when he was one day old. Jonathan has just had his first birthday and has become 'both a very special son and a bit of a symbol for me, I suppose, of how lives can be transformed. We feel very blessed to have him.'</p><p>Rugasira's company grows out of the same principle, he says. While he was in London he talked a lot to the fair trade movement, but he has not wanted his company branded in that way, feeling that the model, though welcome, is too limiting. He feared that the big multinational coffee producers - Nestl&eacute;, Starbucks, Douwe Egberts and the rest - would simply produce fair trade niche products and the old 'somewhat colonial' standards would continue alongside them. (In fact just after I leave Kampala both Nestl&eacute; and Doewe Egberts announce just such plans). Rugasira is grateful to Fairtrade for raising consciousness, and believes he is part of the same movement. But he thinks too that the real emphasis for change in Africa should be in supporting African products and companies. His ideas for transparency include creating a website on which all the data about his farmers is stored, and on which coffee drinkers will be able to email growers directly about their lives. 'The consumer carries a big stick,' he says, 'and there will be change.'</p><p>Several people I speak to talk of Rugasira as 'the next president of Uganda'. He is a natural politician but he says he has no interest at all in that notion. 'One of my frustrations has been that politics in Africa is seen as the only route to take in terms of transforming societies,' he says. 'When I look at how other economies and societies have developed in the west, or in Asia, it is always enterprise and wealth creation that has actually created them. Trade is the base and the politics is the superstructure. I just want to sell coffee.'</p><p>The more time I spend with Rugasira, the more worries I have that this is too good to be true. To validate his analysis I talk to local politicians in Kasese and to the Chief Executive of the Coffee Development board in Kampala. They enthusiastically endorse his model; put all of their faith in his commitment. I visit the orphanage he supports in Kampala where his son Jonathan was taken after he was found in the rubbish, and, not surprisingly, Rugasira is viewed as a saintly figure. I visit his priest, Father Michael, whose 2,500 strong congregation meets in a vast corrugated warehouse every Sunday, in a Kampala slum. While an apocalyptic tropical rain hammers down on the roof, Father Michael tells of the work Rugasira does with local children and the life he brings to the community. Despite these endorsements, though, if there is one reason I feel I can believe in Good African Coffee it is Charles Kahitison.</p><p>Charles was one of the first farmers to sign up for Rugasira's project. He is a bright, proud, energetic man. On our first day in the montains he greets us, this time without Rugasira, and tells me about his life. 'I always knew there would be something,' he says. 'I knew that if I worked as hard as I could, tried to improve myself, that there would be something.' He lives in a neat two-room hut with his wife and five young children. They are currently taking care of a few more kids because their neighbour is suffering from malaria. As soon as we arrive at his house Charles is full of intelligent ideas about how he could raise the coffee yields on his acre of land, about soil conservation, about the simplicity of the new methods, about the ways in which he trains his group of 50 farmers and how he is volunteering to take on more responsibility for a wider area - even working on Sundays to get the message across.</p><p>His pride and joy, however, are his beehives. He takes me round the back of his hut to show me them. The hives are homemade - cleverly constructed in a variety of styles. The bees produce wonderful honey, he says, and help to pollinate the coffee crop. He is wondering about trying to have beekeeping incorporated into the Rwenzori project; he imagines the whole mountain buzzing. Charles had based the design of his hives on a book about beekeeping, the only book he owns. Because the book is so special to him, he had named his son Macmillan, in honour of its publisher.</p><p>On our last night in Kasese, Rugasira organises a barbecue where a goat is roasted to celebrate the beginning of the harvest. It is attended by his team and some of his model farmers. Charles Kahitison's eyes shine in the light of the fire. He carries with him a duffel bag and opens it with some ceremony to present to me, and our photographer, Peter, some of his 'finest organiacally produced honey'. He then sits with Rugasira and they both tuck into their meat.</p><p>While he is eating, Rugasira explains his vision. By now I have heard versions of this speech half a dozen times, but his conviction never wavers. He tells Charles about the House of Lords launch and how Charles's coffee is now sold in a shop called Waitrose. He is working on a deal, he says, to sell his coffee in even bigger shops called Tesco and Sainsbury's. He tells of his plans for a chain of Good African Coffee Shops in South Africa, Britain and Uganda, and how people in those places will be able to talk to Charles online. He explains how important their partnership is. That by working hard, and living well, in doing his best for his family, in spreading some of his talents and knowledge in the community, Charles is part of the future.</p><p>'There will be people, Charles, who tell you that there is no hope of bettering yourself, of improving your life,' Rugasira says. 'That the work you put in and the training and the new methods are not worth it. There will be farmers who would rather get drunk on banana gin in the sunshine. But they will see that by working as you do, by building your community, that one day soon you will have a bicycle, and your wife will have the best clothes to wear on a Sunday and your children will complete their schooling. And they will think, \"What is he doing that I am not doing?\"'</p><p>Charles thinks about this, chews his meat, and makes a speech of his own. 'Even when the prices were low,' he says, 'and the rebels came and we had to leave our houses to sleep in the forest I always put my faith in something changing in our lives. I knew that something would happen. And Mr Andrew, when Rwenzori Finest Coffee came I knew that this was my opportunity. My time.' He lowers his head, thinks for a while. 'You see,' he says, 'I know that one second, one hour, one day, I will die. There will be no more Charles Kahitison. But I also know now that when that hour comes I will have left something behind me. The help I have given the other farmers in my group, the training they have, will not be forgotten. It will be passed on. So I put my faith in that, and I am thankful.'</p><p>Rugasira smiles. 'Eat' he says. 'Have some more!' He looks at his model farmer across the table. 'You know Charles,' he says, 'when I look at you, I see myself. We believe in the same things. I believe those things are part of the future of this country.' He leans back and laughs at his rhetoric. Even so, sitting out under the African night sky, it is impossible, for a moment, not to agree with him; and, further, it is profoundly strange to think that all that future might depend on which coffee we choose to buy in a supermarket.</p><p>Good African Coffee is available from Waitrose branches.

By 2020, more than half of all British adults will be over 50. In a society that celebrates smooth skin, taut muscles and children's-television-presenter levels of energy, and whose main hope of future economic success is said to lie in creativity and innovation, we will be getting greyer, wrinklier and slower. For the first time in history, most of us can expect to get old.</p><p>So what can we look forward to, apart from lots of cheap motor insurance? It's hard to know, because there's so little discussion. Despite the hordes heading for old age, we prefer to maintain a state of collective denial. Public survival and private self-esteem depend on an Anne Robinson facelifted-type refusal to acknowledge our age. And this is not so surprising when media coverage of ageing invariably focuses on problems of one sort or another: Alzheimer's, or the economic threat posed by an ageing population, with the clear implication that such a population is no use to anyone.</p><p>In fact, the over-50s own 80 per cent of the nation's wealth. They include students, newlyweds, parents of young children, chief executives, government ministers, marathon -runners, backpackers. If we define the old as they have been defined throughout history, as those aged between 50 and 100-plus, they cover two to three generations and include many of the most eminent, active and affluent people in the country.</p><p>Even if we put the age limit higher, given levels of fitness, the same is still true. In the 20th century, notes Pat Thane, professor of contemporary history at London University: 'For most people, death was not preceded by a long period of serious dependency.'</p><p>'Fifty is the new 30,' claims Andrew Goodsell, chief executive of Saga, even more bullishly. Saga has built up a &#163;530 million-turnover business from specialising in services (travel, insurance, publishing) for the over-50s. It has done so by neatly finessing the paradox of being an age-related enterprise whose premise is that people don't want to be defined by age. 'We don't like generalised tags,' Goodsell explains. 'We don't think it's appropriate to categorise people.'</p><p>Despite the ironies of the sell, he is right. A thriving third age, as the French usefully think of it, is not primarily dependent on the number of birthdays passed. People can become decrepit fourth-agers in their sixties, or they can be like Jenny Wood-Allen of Dundee who, in 2002, at the age of 90, became the oldest woman to complete a marathon. This makes George Bush Snr's decision to celebrate his 80th birthday by making a parachute jump look almost half-hearted.</p><p>The multitude of third-agers may be new, but, as Pat Thane points out in a new book, The Long History of Old Age,(Thames and Hudson), longevity itself is not. Before the 20th century, life expectancy was only 40-45, but the figures were skewed by high rates of infant and maternal mortality. In the 18th century, at least 10 per cent of the European population was over 60.</p><p>A good proportion of these older people have always refused to settle down in front of the historical equivalent of Countdown. Doge Enrico -Dandolo led the citizens of Venice on the fourth Crusade in 1204 at the age of 97. John Wesley eventually admitted to starting to feel old in 1789 at 86. Victor Hugo became a senator in 1876 aged 74. Mid-20th-century politics simply wouldn't have existed without old men (which might, in fact, have been a good thing): Stalin died in office at 74, Brezhnev at 76. Winston Churchill was 65 when the Second World War broke out in 1939, endured a punishing workload as war leader for the next six years and was re-elected Prime Minister in 1951 aged nearly 77. Franco was head of state in Spain until he died at 83 in 1975.</p><p>Health, clearly, is the single most important ingredient of a good old age. The US National Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention claims that research now unequivocally proves that lifestyle is more influential than genes in avoiding age-related health collapse. If this seems alarming, it may be comforting to know that experts have always prescribed diets for a healthy future, and they have been many and various. In the 17th century, for instance, older people were supposed to drink red wine and milk and eat the flesh of young animals, presumably on the grounds that these foods had something vaguely virile about them.</p><p>All the vibrant older people I talked to for this article were, however, at least conscious of diet and exercise. Margery Mason, a 92-year-old working actor who has recently written her memoirs, had just swum half a mile when I went to see her at her garden flat in Swiss Cottage in north London. She does this every weekday, except on her recent birthday, when she swam a mile by way of celebration. She got her diving certificate the day after her 81st birthday but recently gave up, fed up with how protective people had become of her.</p><p>Affluence is important if you want to spend winters in the sun or climb Kilimanjaro, but above a certain level of comfort, it matters less than one might expect. Hugh Scurlock, 64, of Matlock in Derbyshire, is living on part of a teacher's pension, following the break-up of his 31-year marriage when he w as 53. Despite having had a hip replacement, he is a triathlete and in training for an iron man competition next year (a two-and-a-half mile swim, followed by a 112-mile cycle ride, followed by a marathon) and recently went backpacking up the Amazon. He has remarried and is writing his memoirs. 'Money's not that important,' he says. 'What you really need is goals.'</p><p>Intense loneliness in old age is less common than it used to be. Lower infant mortality rates mean that people are now commonly in touch with at least one child. Moving around for work or marriage is nothing new, but the telephone and internet make keeping in touch much simpler. Communities are no longer constrained by geography but may be interest-based, including those of ethnicity and religion. Family and community clearly sustain many third-agers, but they are not what really seems to single out the happiest and most vigorous.</p><p>Cicero said: 'Old age will only be respected if it fights for itself, maintains its rights, avoids dependence on anyone and asserts control over its own to its last breath.' This remains as true for the 21st-century third-agers as it was for the Romans. What you notice about the most vital third-agers is the depth of their passions, the scope of their projects.</p><p>Almost every week, someone issues a dire warning about the demographic time bomb. This month, the OECD predicted a 30 per cent decline in global economic growth as a result of too few babies and an army of oldsters on the march towards their centenaries. Such predictions usually ignore the effects of immigration and the cost 'benefits' of having to educate fewer children. Every bit as importantly, they fail to acknowledge the possibility that not everyone will want to retire at 65.</p><p>People who do creative jobs tend to want to go on doing them for as long as possible, because the creativity is mainly what makes them feel human. In the past few years, Margery Mason has had small parts in Love Actually and the latest Harry Potter, done a couple of television roles and been on stage in Three Sisters with Kristin Scott Thomas directed by Michael Blakemore. But to her great disappointment, she's had nothing of the longevity or impact of her part in Peak Practice, in which she began an eight-year run at the age of 79.</p><p>She doesn't have a pension: 'Not even a proper state pension, because when I was out of work, I didn't always bother to sign on.' But this is not what drives her. (She owns two floors of a beautiful house with garden, which must be worth around a million.) Nor, despite having done some 'very, very good work in my time', did she ever quite break through. But she doesn't mind this. She continues because she simply can't imagine doing anything else; acting remains who she is. Her main complaint about life now she's old? 'I'm very sad and concerned about not apparently having any work in the offing. That, and being called \"dear\" by taxi drivers.'</p><p>Union lobbying recently blocked the government's plans to raise the normal retirement age of public servants from 60 to 65. For many people, this will have been cause for celebration: retirement is the first time in their lives they can devote themselves to things that really interest them. But it's not axiomatic that everyone wants to stop working as soon as possible.</p><p>Sohan Singh qualified to work in the probation service at the age of 50 and finished his master's in criminology with the Open University last year. A former representative of Kenya in the Mr Universe competition, and a karate black belt third dan, he works out every day. Last year, when he reached 65, he was told he had to retire.</p><p>'I loved the job and didn't really understand how you can be fit to do it one day and not the next. If you've got a contribution to make to society, why would you want to sit back and say, OK, now I am 65, I will stop?' He is currently running a successful project to introduce schoolchildren to a range of faiths in an area of Sunderland where there are high levels of BNP activity.</p><p>Having sat on the executive of the regional Racial Equality Council for 14 years and been its chair, he speaks with some authority when he says: 'Ageism is worse than racism or sexism, because there is so little recognition that it is wrong. There is no commission fighting for your rights ... I'm still physically fit and mentally agile; I don't want to put my feet up yet.</p><p>'Ageing is a little bit like disability, in that a lot of the problems are socially created. People may have slightly more or different needs as they get older, but the key thing is to keep people as human beings, functioning as fully as possible. It is society that imposes on you a sense that you are old. I feel pretty young.'</p><p>Older workers are commonly thought to be less adaptable, less capable of learning, less creative and less adept at mastering technology. Yet whenever these assumptions have been tested, they have been found to be wrong. Age, as Terry Wogan once said, only matters if you're a cheese.</p><p>The one thing you can say about older people is that there's no one thing you can say about them. They're a vast and heterogeneous group, which is why nomenclature has proved so difficult: can't call them pensioners any more, or OAPs, or the elderly unless they're in a care home. The American term 'seniors' looked promising for a while but may well now be permanently contaminated by the phrase: 'I'm having a senior moment.'</p><p>Far from struggling to remember where they put the keys, many in this group are exhaustingly dynamic. I lost count of how many over-60s I came across who were cycling the length and breadth of Britain for charity, or sleeping in Buenos Aires guesthouses so as to learn to salsa properly. Future historians are going to be overwhelmed by material, because every other person seems to be writing a memoir, not necessarily for publication, but because, for the first time in history, masses of -people have enough time, energy and education to try it.</p><p>Margery Mason told me she had the most satisfying love affair of her life when she was in her 60s. She's probably not the only one. Perhaps we need to go back to something more like the Middle Ages, when a person's precise age wasn't always known, when society was less bureaucratised and age wasn't a basic organising principle. There will come a time for each of us when we can no longer do what we want. Until then, it makes sense to get on and do as much as you can.</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/oct/30/features.review17","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2005/oct/30/features.review17","sectionName":"From the Observer"},{"webTitle":"British Council launches online art showcase","webPublicationDate":"2005-10-05T23:01:48Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2005/oct/06/news.arts","fields":{"body":"<p>One of the world's largest collections of contemporary British art goes on show today, showcasing work from the likes of Henry Moore, David Hockney and Tracey Emin - and the venue is just a click of the mouse away.</p><p>The British Council's new online database, <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org\">www.britishcouncil.org</a> collection, provides details of the 8,000 works in its permanent collection, 80% of which is on tour at any one time.</p><p>The website allows visitors the opportunity to trace the whereabouts of each artwork.

But as darkness falls, and villagers huddle around paraffin lamps, three red neon lights come to life on a hillside overlooking their huts. They illuminate a mobile phone mast, the latest addition to the landscape.<P>Africa is in the grip of a mobile phone revolution. In the past 10 years subscribers in sub-Saharan Africa have risen from 72,000 - excluding South Africa - to a forecast 25.5 million this year. As rival operators compete in the world's fastest-growing market, networks are spreading to rural areas such as Funyula.<P>Since the base station in Funyula started up last month, three entrepreneurs have started public phone booths using landline-style handsets with mobile technology. At one booth Yuanina Juma pulled a crumpled letter from her bag and punched in her husband's number. He is away working in the capital, Nairobi. \"When are you coming back?\" she asked, as her one-year-old son held on to her skirt. \"You have to send me money, because I am broke.\"<P>At another booth beside a bus shelter, Evelyn Anyango waited to call her uncle in Uganda: \"There is a funeral. My little sister died of malaria.\"<P>In a culture where people travel long distances to find work, the mobile has become the most useful and ubiquitous piece of technology since the bicycle. It is changing lives in ways unimagined in the developed world. It links distant families and allows the poor to communicate.<P>The phone companies initially expected mobiles to be a toy for the elite, but some 80% of Kenyan operator Safaricom's business comes from its cheapest top-up, worth the equivalent of 72p. Using small amounts of credit on a pre-paid mobile suits a hand-to-mouth society where even daily goods such as margarine or tea are sold in tiny packets.<P>Those who lack the credit to call often resort to \"flashing\" - calling another number for a few seconds and then waiting to be called back. The practice is considered rude, but it is very popular. Phone booth operators in Funyula make money that way, charging customers 2p a time to \"flash\" someone. Mobiles are more reliable than fixed lines, which suffer from copper theft and get washed away in the rainy season.<P>Mobiles have an economic impact, too. Fishermen on Lake Victoria are trying to use their phones to get a better price for their catch. \"We call fishermen on the other beaches to see if the fish are plentiful,\" said Lucas Ratory. \"If there are fewer fish, we can try to get a better price.\"<P>The technology has had a bigger impact on shopkeepers and tradesmen, who use it to keep in touch with suppliers and customers. \"Before we got a signal here, I was doing five or six jobs a week,\" said electrician Isaac Kamande. \"Now I'm doing 20 or 30 jobs a week. Before, people had to call the landline, which was not all that reliable . . . customers couldn't reach me - they had to send somebody with a message.\"<P>Mobile phones could change the face of banking in Africa.

But as darkness falls, and villagers huddle around paraffin lamps, three red neon lights come to life on a hillside overlooking their huts. They illuminate a mobile phone mast, the latest addition to the landscape.<P>Africa is in the grip of a mobile phone revolution. In the past 10 years, subscribers in sub-Saharan Africa have risen from 72,000 - excluding South Africa - to a forecast 25.5 million this year. As rival operators compete in the world's fastest-growing market, networks are spreading to rural areas such as Funyula.<P>Since the base station in Funyula started up last month, three entrepreneurs have started public phone booths using landline-style handsets with mobile technology. At one booth, Yuanina Juma pulled a crumpled letter from her bag and punched in her husband's number. He is away working in the capital, Nairobi. \"When are you coming back?\" she asked, as her one-year-old son held on to her skirt. \"You have to send me money, because I am broke.\"<P>At another booth beside a bus shelter, Angelina Odhuor called her son-in-law, who works in a hospital in the Rift Valley region. \"My daughter needs school fees,\" she told him. \"Can you help us?\" Queueing behind her, Evelyn Anyango waited to call her uncle in Uganda: \"I am calling him to come because there is a funeral. My little sister died of malaria.\"<P>In a culture where people travel long distances to find work, the mobile has become the most useful and ubiquitous piece of technology since the bicycle. Just as bicycles are used in rural Africa to transport bananas or paying passengers, the mobile is changing lives in ways unimagined in the developed world. It links distant families and allows the poor to communicate.<P>The phone companies initially expected mobiles to be a toy for the elite, but some 80% of Kenyan operator Safaricom's business comes from its cheapest top-up, worth the equivalent of 72p. Using small amounts of credit on a pre-paid mobile suits a hand-to-mouth society where even daily goods such as margarine or tea are sold in tiny packets.<P><b>'Flashing'</b><P>Those who lack the credit to call often resort to \"flashing\" - calling another number for a few seconds and then waiting to be called back. The practice is considered rude, but it is very popular. Phone booth operators in Funyula make money that way, charging customers 2p a time to \"flash\" someone. Mobiles are more reliable than fixed lines, which suffer from copper theft and get washed away in the rainy season.<P>As in Britain, the fixed-line phone booth has been a victim of the mobile's success. There are three landline booths in Funyula which are either out of order or disused. Mobiles have an economic impact, too. Fishermen on Lake Victoria are trying to use their phones to get a better price for their catch. \"We call fishermen on the other beaches to see if the fish are plentiful,\" said Lucas Ratory, leaning on his boat. \"If there are fewer fish, we can try to get a better price.\"<P>But their bargaining power is limited through lack of cold storage. Even if the men know there are fewer fish that day, the firms who buy their fish can leave the catch to rot if the price is too high.<P>The new technology has had a bigger impact on shopkeepers and tradesmen, who use it to keep in touch with suppliers and customers. \"Before we got a signal here, I was doing five or six jobs a week,\" said electrician Isaac Kamande. \"Now I'm doing 20 or 30 jobs a week. Before, people had to call the landline, which was not all that reliable. On rainy days, it goes off. Maybe there would be an emergency, but customers couldn't reach me - they had to send somebody with a message.\"<P>Mobiles could change the face of banking in Africa. Without steady incomes the poor cannot open bank accounts or get credit cards, but new mobile services offer a way of moving money that bypasses banks.<P>In Kenya, operators Safaricom and Celtel allow customers to buy airtime and transfer it to another customer's phone via SMS. That means a customer in Nairobi can pay for the time and then send it on to a cousin in a distant village. Once the airtime is credited to the cousin's phone, it can be exchanged for cash or bartered for other goods.<P>In Funyula, some families already receive airtime from wealthier relatives in this way. Analysts believe that phones could become electronic wallets. \"From the consumer point of view, one of the main constraints to economic growth in Africa is the lack of credit cards,\" said Tim Kelly, head of the strategy and policy unit at the International Telecommunication Union, a UN agency. \"If the established credit card companies do not fill this market gap, it is likely that mobile phone operators will.\"<P>Mobiles are proving to be a force for democracy too. In the run-up to the Ethiopian elections in May, text messaging was used to advertise political parties for the first time. \"A nation with poor communications is one in which the citizenry is obliged to make personal visits to government offices for even the most trivial requests,\" said Dr Kelly. \"Mobile phones begin to change this process, both on the part of users, who can call instead of queueing, and on the part of government officials, who can deal with cases more efficiently.\"<P>Mobile use in Africa leapfrogged fixed lines as long ago as 2001, but it is still the least-connected continent. Some 40% of sub-Saharan Africa's inhabitants still live beyond a mobile signal, though that percentage is falling all the time as more base stations are erected.<P>Rival operators are competing fiercely for a slice of the vast untapped market. The key regional players are South Africa's MTN and Vodacom, in which British firm Vodafone has a stake, and the Kuwaiti-owned Celtel International.<P><b>Untapped</b><P>In recent years, the fastest growth has been seen in oil-rich Nigeria, where mobile phone use has rise from 30,000 in 2000 to more than 9 million by 2005. MTN, which claims 9.5 million clients continent-wide, has a highly profitable operation there. Vodacom's annual report says it has 15.5 million customers and is the market leader in the continent's richest country, South Africa. It is keen to expand in central Africa. Celtel says it has 5 million customers spread across 13 countries, including Kenya, Tanzania and Sudan, a nation with oil wealth where profits could be large.<P>But there is still one major barrier: the cost of the handset. \"Africa demands a cheap, basic handset. People here don't want an MP3 player,\" said Les Baillie, chief financial officer of Kenya's Safaricom. \"The problem is that manufacturers have all been making upgrades for their big market in Europe, but have ignored Africa.\"<P>That could be about to change. In February, a group of around 50 manufacturers pledged to develop a low-cost handset for sale for less than &pound;16, a solution which might be tailor-made for a poor continent desperate to get talking."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/14/kenya.hearafrica05","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2005/sep/14/kenya.hearafrica05","sectionName":"World news"},{"webTitle":"Full text: Gordon Brown at the TUC","webPublicationDate":"2005-09-13T13:01:30Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/2005/sep/13/tradeunions.uk4","fields":{"body":"Let us today, on this day of celebration for a great English national sporting success, congratulate the England cricket team. And let us congratulate London on winning for Britain the Olympics for 2012.<P>And let me add a personal note. This is a time when we also remember men and women who have served the trades union movement and our country - in particular this year Ron Todd and Jim Callaghan, and only a month after their unexpected and early deaths, I know all will want to join me in paying tribute to two other titans of the labour movement - both of whom died tragically and unexpectedly, both who died in their fifties far too young, both who died after distinguished careers working for causes close to the heart of the trades union movement, two who died with such a huge contribution still to make.<P>Mo Mowlam was the people's minister - an inspiration to women everywhere - and let us agree that there must now be a fitting memorial to her work and achievement.<P>And the passion of Robin Cook's commitment to social justice was and is an inspiration to all who were influenced by him and in every continent. Inspired by Robin's example let us affirm, as he did, that whenever there is injustice, we will seek to eradicate it, wherever there is poverty we will fight a war against it.<P>And Tony Blair and I want to thank each one of you for your efforts and achievement in putting right at the centre of the agenda causes which Tony and I share with you:<P><b>&#183;</b> The cause of full employment<br> <b>&#183;</b> The central importance of manufacturing<br> <b>&#183;</b> The moral and economic case for decent universal and free public services available to all<br> <b>&#183;</b> And - as the Warwick agenda to which we jointly committed demonstrates - fairness to all in the workplace. <P>And I am here today to tell you that Tony Blair and the government will, as a priority, put into place this year and next the legislation honouring in full the Warwick agreement.<P>So let me assure you that we will implement our agreement that no one should see their health or safety recklessly put at risk in the workplace and so we have announced legislation outlawing corporate manslaughter.<P>Let me assure you that on gangmasters we will licence and regulate employment so that we protect lives by rooting out dangerous abuses.<P>Let me also tell you that we are legislating for enhanced rights at work with the eight-week rule extended to twelve. And on holidays and working hours, we are moving to add Bank Holidays to four weeks paid holiday.<P>Fairness at work means fairness to the low paid and it is because of your efforts and the initial commitment of John Smith and then of Tony Blair that Britain now has a minimum wage, one that I am pleased to report will rise again this year - rising by 40% since it was introduced - and again next year. And the legal minimum wage is now extended for the first time to all 16 and 17 year olds.<P>And because Britain has historically neglected childcare we are now implementing, as a result of Warwick, a new national childcare strategy. And because women's rights and women's equality have been unacceptably neglected for far too long we are even now studying recommendations from Margaret Prosser, chair of the women and work commission. Our aim: to move to ending once and for all the gender pay gap.<P>Having introduced the first winter fuel payment of &#163;200 for the first time, free TV licences worth &#163;100, the first pension credit paid to over two and a half million people, free local bus travel, we will, as we said at Warwick - and this is the debate we should have when the pension commission completes it work - respond to the new pension commission investigation into the capacity and limits of the current voluntarist system by seeking to make sure that not just some but all workers have the chance of security and dignity in retirement.<P>And let me add, because it is morally wrong that when firms go under workers through no fault of their own lose their pensions too, so in partnership we have set up the new pension protection fund, and for pension funds that have previously gone under we have already put aside &#163;400m.<P>Most of all on the future of our economy - and this is the central theme I want to discuss with you today - since 1997 we have been building a Britain that is not only more stable than at any time for a generation, but a Britain that has used its stability for a purpose - unemployment the lowest for 30 years, long-term youth unemployment - once 350,000 young lives written off - now less than 7,000, restoring full employment to the centre of economic policy and bringing us closer to full employment than at any time in our generation.<P>I tell you I will never forget how, starting as an MP in 1983, in a constituency with thousands unemployed, I met hundreds of coal miners, steel workers, shipbuilding craftsmen thrown out of their jobs at 50 who expected never to work again, young couples who, having lost their jobs, lost their homes too, youngsters once bright eyed and hopeful, rejected and dejected even before they had a first pay cheque.<P>So none of us must forget how the experts wrote off 3 million unemployed, how the commentators fell for unemployment as an inevitability. Let us remember how many lost heart and succumbed to the propaganda that, as manual tasks were mechanised, as digital and computer technology replaced the jobs of skilled workers, that we should bury for ever the idea that we could ever have an economy founded on full employment.<P>But we never lost heart, we never fell for this defeatism, we never surrendered our goal of full employment. And, when we passed resolutions for jobs, marched for jobs, rallied for jobs, campaigned for jobs, we were upholding to the world ideals we still uphold to this day. We were arguing not only that mass unemployment is unfair and inefficient, but sending out an even bigger message, the philosophy I grew up with in a mining and industrial community in Fife: that we do not pass by on the other side, that our mission is to build communities where we look out for each other, feel each others sorrows and share each others pain. It is a belief that injustice should not happen to us, injustice should not happen to anyone, principles we taught each other in hard times, of solidarity not selfishness and as relevant today as ever. So, when people tell us again that the impact of global change, the rise of China and Asia, mean we have to lower our aspirations, when they tell us that as manufacturing becomes global, we must accept that full employment and good decent paying jobs are now not there for all who need them, I tell you, in the same way that together we met the challenge of mass unemployment by applying our principles in the New Deal and went on to create in eight years an unprecedented 2 million jobs, we should agree now that, as long as we make the right long-term decisions, we can meet and master an even greater challenge: the challenge of globalisation.<P>Let me tell you the scale of the global challenge.<P>In the last 18 months the doubling of oil prices is just one visible sign of the scale and speed of global economic change. Asia's manufacturing output now greater than Europe; Asia now consuming 30% of world oil and China almost 10%; once only responsible for 10% of world manufactured exports, Asia and developing countries will soon produce 50%. On its own, China already produces 30% of the world's television sets, 50% of cameras, 70% of photocopiers, even 90% of children's toys, and perhaps soon 60% of all the world's clothing.<P>At no point since the industrial revolution has the restructuring of global economic activity been so dramatic; at no point has there been such a shift in production, Asia moving from the fringes to the centre of the new world economic order; and at no point in our whole history has the speed and scale of technological change been so fast and pervasive.<P>Think back only to 1997: no digital TV, no DVDs, no videophones, no broadband, virtually no texting. Just eight years ago only 10% people were on the internet and only 10% had mobile phones.<P>So, if in only eight years since 1997, we have seen such dramatic technological and scientific change, then think of the impact in the next eight years of technology on occupations, industries, businesses and jobs.<P>And this is not, as is sometimes said, a race to bottom with China and India that can be met by protecting our home industries, shutting foreign goods out and hoping the world will go away.<P>Because they aspire not to race us to the bottom, but to be high skill, high technology economies, China and India are now turning out more engineers, more computer scientists, more university graduates - 4 million a year, more than the whole of Europe and America combined. And so the answer lies not in protectionism, hoping Asia will go away, but in radically upgrading our skills, science and technology.<P>For me, nothing in the next years is more important than preparing and equipping our nation for meeting and mastering these global challenges ahead. And I do not disguise the scale of changes ahead so that we British working people can instead of being the victims of globalisation, be its beneficiaries.<P>And I want us now to work together on a long-term economic reform plan for global success. And today I issue an invitation to the TUC and trades unions here, as well as business, to enter into a discussion with the Treasury and the government in detail on how a more skilled, more adaptable and more enterprising Britain, can make the right long-term decisions and succeed in the next stage of the global economy - so that facing future economic challenges greater than since 1945, mastering technological and trading changes more dramatic than in any century of our industrial history, we can - working together in the interests of prosperity, not for some but for all - ensure that we can turn global change from a threat into an opportunity.<P>Our education system geared to empowering young people with training and skills, opportunities for realising their potential they never had before; our welfare state reformed to ensuring adult men and women can move from low skills to high skills, matching flexibility with fairness; and our science infrastructure upgraded so British inventiveness leads the world; European economic reform to open up markets for British firms. Every part of our infrastructure transport and communications geared up to the challenge of global change.<P>Our whole focus: to stand up for Britain, to ensure that Britain does not once again relapse into decline and failure.<P>Let me tell you - and particularly our manufacturing unions - that the global challenge strengthens rather than lessens the case for investment in manufacturing and in our regions.<P>As we agreed with you at Warwick, we will give new support to manufacturing by investing in science, technology, our transport and infrastructure and in the manufacturing advisory service. And the manufacturing forum - now up and running with full trade union representation - is today, at your request, looking at public procurement so that British companies are no longer unfairly denied contracts and markets across key sectors of the European economy and that British workers and Britain industry secure a fair deal.<P>Honouring our promise that manufacturing should not be seen as part of the old economy but that together we build modern manufacturing strength for the future.<P>And if China and India are turning out 4 million graduates a year, then we cannot afford to waste the talent of any child, write off the potential of any young person, discard the abilities of any adult.<P>It is because the skills of workers are the new commanding heights of the economy, it is because the skills of working people are now the most critical means of production, it is because increasingly it is the skills of working people that gives companies value and gives nations comparative advantage, that new principles must guide education and training in ensuring good well paying jobs for the future. Education should no longer be from five to 16 but on offer from three to eighteen, every teenager should have the right to further education, and every adult the guarantee of training in basic skills.<P>So let us salute - in each of the unions - today's trade union pioneers of the new skills revolution: the 12,000 men and women who are trade union learning representatives rightly bargaining for skills, the 100,000 who have been helped back into learning in over 400 trade union learning centres, over 2 million workers succeeding in Learn Direct and the Skills For Life programme, and the employer training pilots which are breaking with the old failed voluntarism of the past and ensuring that, in return for time off, workers have the financial support to obtain the new skills they want and need.<P>And I can tell you today that to support the new trade union academy we will provide over the next two years &#163;4.5m, part of a total investment of &#163;8bn a year in skills, showing we will answer the Asia challenge, not by becoming resigned to a Britain of low skills and high unemployment, but by creating a Britain of new skills and new jobs.<P>And I tell you straight: Britain can win in this global economy. We will win because we will not compete on low pay but on high skills; we will win because we will not respond to globalisation by lowering our standards in the workplace but by raising them; and we will win because we will not adjust to global change by protectionism and neglecting investment but by investing more and for the long term.<P>This is nothing less than the economic battle for Britain's future and upon winning this battle by focusing rigorously on the priorities that matter most, the future financing of our public services, the war on poverty, the potential for full employment in the years to come depends.<P>And I also tell you straight - in the face of that global challenge from which there is no hiding place, no safe haven other than equipping ourselves better for our future - if we are to succeed there must be no return to the fiscal irresponsibility, the economic short-termism, the inflationary pay deals and the old conflicts and disorder of the past; there can be no retreat from demanding efficiency and value for money as well as equity as we renew and reform public services; there is no future for a global trading nation like ours in trying to erect protectionist barriers with the rest of the world. And just as we need stability in inflation and interest rates, we need stability in our industry policy, stability in industrial relations, and stability in our trading relationships with the rest of the world, and we build this stability for a purpose: for it is the one sure route to full employment for our generation and to prosperity for all.<P>And at every time we must act to tackle the risks to stability and growth, risks that are today already reducing European growth rates to 1% and raising European unemployment beyond 20 million, risks that now have risen from the doubling of world oil prices. Global challenges need global solutions.<P>It is because we understand the problems faced by hauliers, farmers and motorists at a time of doubling oil prices and because we will never be complacent that the first action we must take is to tackle the cause of the problem: ensuring concerted global action is taken to bring down world oil prices and stabilise the market for the long term. And in the last few days alone I have discussed our plans with 30 of the world's finance ministers and spoken to representatives of all the world's leading economies.<P>First, because this is, at root, a problem of demand outstripping supply, Opec must respond at its meeting on September 19 to rising demand by raising production.<P>Second, lack of transparency about the world's reserves and plans for their development undermine stability and cause speculation. The world must call on Opec to become more open and more transparent.<P>Third, from the additional $300bn dollars a year in revenue Opec countries are now enjoying and the additional $800bn available to oil producers, there must be additional new investment in production and global investment in refining capacity.<P>Fourth, the search for alternative sources of energy and greater energy efficiency is urgent to ensure both the maintenance of economic growth and tackling climate change, and the World Bank should set up a new fund to support developing countries investing in alternative sources of energy and greater energy efficiency.<P>Fifth, poor countries and poor people should not ever be left defenceless against oil and commodity price shocks and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should agree, as a matter of urgency, to create, a new facility for countries hit by these shocks.<P>And, because we have a special duty to help not just the immediate needs but the long-term prospects of the poorest of the world, oil producers should now agree to use their windfall revenues to create a special trust fund where oil producers help debt ridden poor countries write down their unpayable debts.<P>At each point willing to take the tough long-term decisions.<P>And it is by securing economic prosperity and insisting the benefits go not just to the few but everyone, that we will achieve another goal: to build world-class public services in Britain.<P>Let me say that, because of our commitment to public services and their renewal we are extending the local government agreement right across the public sector to bring to an end the two-tier workforce.<P>And let me here, publicly from this rostrum, thank Britain's public servants who - in those anxious hours facing the terrorist threat on July 7 and beyond - rose to the challenge and worked tirelessly, showing bravery, dedication and commitment to tending the wounded, comforting the bereaved, protecting the anxious and serving the public first.<P>Let me take this opportunity to say publicly what is often left unsaid and taken for granted, and thank all our emergency public services. Workers in our hospitals, from the doctors, nurses and nursing auxiliaries to porters, ambulance men and women, cleaners and catering staff, men and women who show not only exceptional skill and professionalism but every day also demonstrate extraordinary care, compassion and friendship.<P>Teachers and the teaching assistants, the school dinner ladies and caretakers who at their very best show with their dedication day in and day out that every child and every child's future counts.<P>And in our communities, public servants and local government workers pioneering new services from childcare and job-help to neighbourhood wardens; carers whose unbelievable compassion and support can transform despair into hope; home helps and support staff whose commitment and humanity show that public service can be a calling and not just a career.<P>And proving that Britain can be a beacon to the world for high standard free universal public services.<P>For there is, indeed, a second reason for winning the battle here in Britain for our generation for universal free public services, so that not just British people benefit but that we can offer new hope to developing countries too.<P>For, as Tony Blair, Jack Straw and Hilary Benn will tell the world at the special UN summit that starts tomorrow on making poverty history, it is only by building universal free schooling and creating free universal health care that the people of Africa and developing countries can begin to eliminate illiteracy disease and poverty.<P>In my eight years as chancellor I have visited some of the poorest parts of Asia and Africa. I have seen the faces of people crushed by poverty upon whom all the troubles of the world bear down; I have met mothers in Asia who, in using every ounce of their energy to save the lives of their newborn infants, are about to lose their own; I have heard children in Kenya demonstrating and chanting the demand for \"free education\"; I have met mothers in Mozambique who waved their pay cheques at me, demonstrating that no matter how hard they worked they could not afford to pay the fees for schooling their children; I have met some of the 12 million Aids orphans excluded from both education and any health care; and I met only a few weeks ago in Tanzania an Aids victim who could not afford a visit to a hospital or to a doctor or to pay for any drugs to relieve his pain, saying to me: \"I know I am despised but are we not all brothers?\" I tell you for the 120 million children who did not go to school today, and for the 30,000 children who face avoidable death from disease today, there is not a chance to escape disease, illiteracy and poverty if they are charged for healthcare or if there are fees for education, no hope at all for the poorest communities and the poorest people without free and universal public services.<P>Make Poverty History is the theme chosen by your president for this week. And let me thank you, Brendan, who spoke at that weekend Make Poverty History rally we attended in Edinburgh and let me thank every trades union for your work, in the finest internationalist traditions of your movement, as a driving force in the Make Poverty History coalition.<P>And let me congratulate you for your key role in winning at Gleneagles for the first time in our history 100% debt relief; in exposing agricultural protectionism and the scandal and waste of the common agricultural policy; in securing a commitment not just to double aid to Africa but from 11 European governments spend 0.7% of their national income on development, demonstrating the truth of the belief on which our movement was founded that as individuals we are not powerless but, acting together we have the power to shape history.<P>But, I say to you today, as we look to the future and recognise not just what we have done together but must now campaign upon in the coming years, let the new demand from trades unionists, from churches and faith groups, from Make Poverty History campaigners all over Britain and all over the world be that to truly make poverty history, Africa must win the battle we have had to fight and win in Britain: there must be universal and free schooling and healthcare as the beginning of justice for the poorest countries of the world.<P>And when people say financing free universal health care and schooling for the world's poor is an impossible dream, I say: 200 years ago people said an end to slavery was an impossible dream; 100 years ago people once said a British welfare state free schooling and a free NHS in Britain was an impossible dream; just 20 years ago people said Nelson Mandela's release and the end of apartheid was an impossible dream; and just a year ago the same kind of people said 100% debt relief for the highly indebted countries was an impossible dream.<P>Our ancestors knew how much easier it was to be unambitious rather than to aim high: simpler to be conservative than to seek change; less difficult to take your own share than fight for everyone to have a fair share; more comfortable to see progress as moving up on your own than ensuring everyone moves up together; less demanding to succumb to vested interests than take them on. But instead our pioneers held fast to the vision that progress is everyone moving forward together.<P>And, as we look at the challenges ahead - building in this new global economy full employment, modern manufacturing strength, ending child and pensioner poverty, the best public services and, yes, the elimination of poverty around the world - let us agree that the finest traditions of our movement is not to settle for second best, but to reach high, never to lower our sights but to strive to make once unrealisable dreams come true. In the spirit of the highest ideals of our movement, let us acknowledge the great causes worth fighting for:<P><b>&#183;</b> a society founded on equality<br> <b>&#183;</b> driven forward by a commitment to justice<br> <b>&#183;</b> dedicated to fairness for all<br> <b>&#183;</b> a Britain worthy of our pioneers<br> <b>&#183;</b> a Britain true to our ideals<br><P>and we achieve our ideals best when we achieve them together."},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/sep/13/tradeunions.uk4","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2005/sep/13/tradeunions.uk4","sectionName":"Politics"}]}}
