The rest is known as dark matter and dark energy, because their precise identities are unknown. The Cosmic Cocktail is the inside story of the epic quest to solve one of the most compelling enigmas of modern science -- what is the universe made of? -- told by one of today's foremost pioneers in the study of dark matter.<br />Blending cutting-edge science with her own behind-the-scenes insights as a leading researcher in the field, acclaimed theoretical physicist Katherine Freese recounts the hunt for dark matter, from the discoveries of visionary scientists like Fritz Zwicky -- the Swiss astronomer who coined the term \"dark matter\" in 1933 -- to the deluge of data today from underground laboratories, satellites in space, and the Large Hadron Collider. Theorists contend that dark matter consists of fundamental particles known as WIMPs, or weakly interacting massive particles. Billions of them pass through our bodies every second without us even realizing it, yet their gravitational pull is capable of whirling stars and gas at breakneck speeds around the centers of galaxies, and bending light from distant bright objects. Freese describes the larger-than-life characters and clashing personalities behind the race to identify these elusive particles.<br />Many cosmologists believe we are on the verge of solving the mystery. The Cosmic Cocktail provides the foundation needed to fully fathom this epochal moment in humankind's quest to understand the universe.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> I absolutely <em>love</em> that one of the world's foremost authorities of dark matter is a woman, and I also love how she tells this story. In this book, the author not only tells us about dark matter research and about the historical contributions of some famous scientists to the development of astrophysics, but she also shares the personal story of her career trajectory in this heavily male-dominated field. Includes a 6-page insert of colour photographs, along with numerous black-and-white photographs, maps, and diagrams (the book even includes a photograph of a penguin!) embedded into each chapter. </p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3680/14117871227_1a939dd2bb_m.jpg\" width=\"158\" height=\"240\" /> A Dictionary of Journalism by Tony Harcup [Oxford University Press, 2014; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780199646241\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199646244/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199646244/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> A Dictionary of Journalism is an accessible and authoritative quick reference dictionary. It covers over 1,400 wide-ranging entries on the terms that are likely to be encountered by students of the subject, and aims to offer a broad, accessible point of reference on an ever-topical and constantly-changing field that affects everyone's knowledge and perception of the world. <br />Assuming little or no prior knowledge of the subject, it covers terminology relating to the practice, business, and technology of journalism, as well as its concepts and theories, organizations and institutions, publications, and key events. Related topic areas are covered where they impact on or offer explanations of journalism: for example in law, where legislation affects journalistic activity; and where sociological studies seek to aid the understanding of journalism. Appendices include a timeline of journalistic developments, contextualising the ever-evolving nature of journalism, as well as an index of significant individuals in the field.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> This readable and enlightening dictionary is more than just a dictionary in the conventional sense. It defines journalistic terms and places them into the context of journalistic history, which makes for some engaging and instructional reading. Even more interesting, the book's historical background is drawn from the practice of journalism in both the UK and the USA, so everyone will learn something from this book.</p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2910/14117861400_c2f0e43911_m.jpg\" width=\"157\" height=\"240\" /> The Point of View of the Universe: Sidgwick and Contemporary Ethics by Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek and Peter Singer [Oxford University Press, 2014; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199603693/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199603693/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00K79UOQY/livingthescie-20/\">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> What does the idea of taking 'the point of view of the universe' tell us about ethics? The great nineteenth-century utilitarian Henry Sidgwick used this metaphor to present what he took to be a self-evident moral truth: the good of one individual is of no more importance than the good of any other. Ethical judgments, he held, are objective truths that we can know by reason. The ethical axioms he took to be self-evident provide a foundation for utilitarianism. He supplements this foundation with an argument that nothing except states of consciousness have ultimate value, which led him to hold that pleasure is the only thing that is intrinsically good.<br />Are these claims defensible? Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek and Peter Singer test them against a variety of views held by contemporary writers in ethics, and conclude that they are. This book is therefore a defence of objectivism in ethics, and of hedonistic utilitarianism. The authors also explore, and in most cases support, Sidgwick's views on many other key questions in ethics: how to justify an ethical theory, the significance of an evolutionary explanation of our moral judgments, the choice between preference-utilitarianism and hedonistic utilitarianism, the conflict between self-interest and universal benevolence, whether something that it would be wrong to do openly can be right if kept secret, how demanding utilitarianism is, whether we should discount the future, or favor those who are worse off, the moral status of animals, and what is an optimum population.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> It has been a long time since I took an introductory philosophy course, so I am not as familiar these ideas and their proponents as I probably should be. This book is interesting because it carefully examines the philosophy of utilitarian philosopher, Henry Sidgwick, and compares his ideas to a number of other philosophical viewpoints. That said, reading this book has made it plain to me that I am uncomfortable with hedonistic utilitarianism -- that, and I am put off by the authors' paternalistic application of this philosophical position to life-and-death situations. Was Sidgwick so paternalistic? I don't know. </p><p><strong>Field Guides:</strong></p><p>Summer is fast approaching, which means you need to prepare for your holidays! If you are one of those incredibly lucky people who will visit Kenya or Tanzania (or if you are starting to make your plans to visit either of these two African nations), then you will need to familiarise yourself with at least one field guide so you can quickly identify the birds and animals that you may encounter there. As you probably have guessed, it's very late to purchase field guides if you are going on your long dreamt about safaris this summer. But if you have waited until now to start your field guide studies, you will greatly benefit from these three field guides. They are inspirational and indispensable resources for holiday travelers, full of photographs, range maps and other useful information, all presented in a brief but quickly locatable (and easily-recalled!) way, so you can focus on enjoying all the remarkable birds and animals you will see.</p><p><img align=\"right\" src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2914/13943844989_343f8efa63_m.jpg\" width=\"169\" height=\"240\" /> Animals of the Serengeti: And Ngorongoro Conservation Area by Adam Scott Kennedy and Vicki Kennedy [Princeton University Press, 2014; <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691159089\">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691159084/livithescieli-21/\">Amazon UK</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691159084/livingthescie-20/\">Amazon US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> Containing 146 stunning color photos, Animals of the Serengeti is a remarkable look at the mammals and reptiles most likely to be encountered in the world-famous Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater.

He expects to see growth roaring back in the current quarter:.</p> <p>Here&apos;s his note to clients:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a start, the downward revision is almost entirely because inventories were a much bigger drag on growth than previously thought. Inventories subtracted 1.6% from overall GDP growth in the second estimate, compared with a more modest 0.6% in the first estimate. But that bigger first-quarter drag means that we are likely to see a bigger bounce back in the second quarter.</p> <p>More generally, the first-quarter contraction was quite obviously due to the unusually severe winter. It hit durable goods consumption, residential investment, business investment in non-residential structures and exports. But the incoming monthly data already point to a marked turnaround in the second quarter. For those worried about a recession, it&apos;s worth remembering that employment increased by nearly 300,000 in April and jobless claims dropped to 300,000 last week [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/29/japanese-retail-sales-kingfisher-france-us-gdp-live?view=desktop#block-538732b8e4b0a1efcbc04a23\">as flagged at 2.20pm</a>]. Those numbers point to a recovery gathering some real momentum at last. We still expect second-quarter GDP growth to come in close to 3.5%.</p> <p>Finally, the contraction in real GDP resulted in a 9.8% quarterly decline in corporate profits. The weather certainly explains some of the 8.1% decline in non-financial domestic profits. But falling trading revenue and the drop off in mortgage originations caused a 15.0% decline in financial profits. There was also a 9.1% decline in profits from the rest of the world. So while we would also expect a rebound in second-quarter profits, as the weather distortion is unwound, it may not be quite as dramatic as the turnaround in real GDP.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-05-29T14:22:42.990+01:00\">at 2.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-538732b8e4b0a1efcbc04a23\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-29T14:20:24.654+01:00\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>There is good news for the US economy too </b>-- the number of people filing new jobless claims fell to just 300,000 last week, down from 327,000.</p> <p>And the continued claims figure (those who had been claiming for more than a week) slid to 2.631m, the lowest level since November 2007.</p> <p><i>A sign the economy is reviving from its winter chill?</i></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53872f82e4b05a3fd1ec1ae0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-29T14:04:50.617+01:00\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The fall in America&apos;s GDP is mainly due to companies <b>cutting back on investment</b>, particularly in new buildings, and holding back from <b>restocking their warehouses, </b>tweets Deutsche Bank&apos;s <b>Joseph LaVorgna</b>:<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/statuses/471997006656049153\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Q1 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GDP&amp;src=hash\">#GDP</a> was revised down to -1.0% from +0.1% previously, close to our expectations, because of weaker inventories and construction.</p>&mdash; Joseph A.

More than two-thirds of the countries in the region have enjoyed ten or more years of uninterrupted growth.</p> <p>This growth has delivered a more educated population, with significant declines in infant mortality. In Benin and Madagascar, for example, primary school enrolment has increased by more than 50 percentage points. This may be from low levels, but it is still a huge improvement.</p> <p>And for good reasons, Africa is now a growing investment destination for both advanced and emerging economies—with a record $80 billion inflow expected this year.</p> <p>Indeed, it is no surprise that ‘frontier economies’ such as Kenya, Uganda, and Botswana are challenging old stereotypes and roaring loud as <em>Africa’s lions</em>.</p> <p>And yet, the tide of growth has not lifted all boats.</p> <p>Poverty remains stuck at unacceptably high levels—still afflicting about 45 percent of the region’s households. Inequality remains high. And some countries, still facing recurring internal conflict, are struggling to exit from fragility.</p> <p>Africa’s success journey has been truly remarkable. But if the global crisis has taught us anything, it is the importance of making the benefits of growth more broadly shared. When everyone benefits, growth is more durable.</p> </blockquote> <p>What&apos;s the solution?

My role primarily involves investing in innovative organisations that use technology and media platforms to provide access to information and to increase government responsiveness and citizen participation. Recent investments include <a href=\"http://africacheck.org/\" title=\"\">Africa Check</a>, <a href=\"http://livityafrica.com/\" title=\"\">Livity South Africa</a> and the <a href=\"http://africannewschallenge.org/\" title=\"\">Africa News Innovation Challenge</a>. I also spend time making connections between organisations and individuals in the burgeoning civic tech space in Africa and helping others think about how they can best leverage technology in their advocacy work.</p><p><strong>How is technology changing the spread of information in Africa – not only from central authorities to the people but also peer-to-peer?</strong><br />It is enabling information to spread much faster, in real-time; the rapid adoption of new tools is also quite interesting to watch. A year or two ago, BBM [BlackBerry Messenger] was king, now it is WhatsApp. Tools that drive social engagement are particularly interesting to track. In response, those central authorities that want to prevent this are increasingly having to be a lot more repressive in order to do so such as <a href=\"http://www.ifj.org/nc/news-single-view/backpid/32/article/new-crackdown-on-media-is-step-towards-authoritarism-in-ethiopia-says-ifj/\" title=\"\">Ethiopia</a>.</p><p><strong>You co-founded </strong><a href=\"http://www.mzalendo.com/blog/\" title=\"\"><strong>Mzalendo</strong></a><strong>, a pioneering civic website that tracks the performance of Kenya's parliament and its parliamentarians. How did the government feel about this and has its stance changed?</strong><br />The government was initially dismissive towards the website as the internet penetration rate at the time (2006) was low and they didn't think it would impact their perceptions among voters. Over time, as web penetration has grown and as the voting demographic gets younger, they are paying a lot more attention. For instance, they are very quick to send corrections or protest if they feel their contributions in parliament are not being reflected on Mzalendo. We are also seeing greater interest from the local media in partnering with the Mzalendo team to report on the performance of parliament.</p><p><strong>What impact is the internet having on citizen journalism and activism in Africa?</strong><br />I think the internet is having an impact in very diverse ways anchored around amplifying voice, from enabling what I like to refer to as micro-activism. For instance when Kenyan citizens recently expressed displeasure with a presidential appointment on his Facebook page forcing his team to take the Facebook post down and scramble to find ways to explain away the phenomenon; to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/twitter-hashtag-bringbackourgirls-nigeria-mass-kidnapping\" title=\"\">#bringbackourgirls</a>, which started out of Nigerians' frustration with an unresponsive government on the crisis around the kidnapped girls from Chibok, and has gone on to become a global galvanising force. You are also seeing citizens take to the internet to tell their own stories, whether through images (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>), and in collaboration with media (<a href=\"http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/\" title=\"\">Daily Maverick</a> and <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/\" title=\"\">Mail &amp; Guardian Africa</a>).</p><p><strong>How big a challenge is access to internet-connected devices in Africa – and do you see the situation changing  soon?</strong><br />It is still a big challenge but is changing rapidly as smartphone and tablet prices come down and used phones begin to enter the secondary market, the sweet spot as far as pricing appears to be at about $50. Just this month in South Africa sales of smartphones topped feature phones for the first time, and I suspect Kenya is not far-behind.

In 1975 we were living in Lebanon, but we were forced to flee when the country descended into civil war. We essentially became refugees in the UK. Challenging times followed. At 15 I was living in an apartment with just my younger sister. But one of the things that kept me focused and grounded was my early education. So I know first hand the value of learning.</p><p>The initial idea for the e-learning events was sparked in 2004 when I heard about optical fibre cables being laid in Ethiopia. I realised the potential information and communications technologies (ICT) held for development in Africa. This year's elearning Africa conference in Uganda is our 9th. We have been hosted by Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Senegal, Benin and Namibia and typically have over 1,500 participants and more than 300 speakers.</p><p><strong>How do your conferences support development?</strong></p><p>Learning is the cornerstone of all development. Without the underpinning of quality education, other systems upon which development depends – governance, health, economic growth, the judiciary, commerce – can never reach maturity.</p><p>Our e-learning conferences bring together stakeholders from every sector: government, private organisations and bodies like the United Nations Organisation for Education, Science and Culture (Unesco) – techie people can meet academics and everyone in between, and cooperate on development issues.</p><p>But one of our priorities is getting the grassroots workers to the conference. So we award scholarships and subsidies, because it is important that we give people like teachers and headteachers a voice, to gain an understanding of the deeper issues. We also connect them with policymakers and organisations who want to support them, whether through funding or providing materials like computers.</p><p>This networking happens on a number of levels, so a minister from Malawi might connect with a minister from Ghana and they can learn from each other. We try to highlight, not just what is best practice, but also what is worst practice, because part of the solution is knowing what not to do.</p><p><strong>With <a href=\"http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/fs-25-out-of-school-children-en.pdf\" title=\"\">30 million children out of school in Sub-Saharan Africa (pdf)</a>, the region has been identified as <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/africa/priority-africa/education/\" title=\"\">a priority area for Unesco</a>. How can ICT help to address the problem?</strong></p><p>An African permanent secretary once told me that e-learning is the solution for education in Africa. I pointed out that I come from a generation that was schooled without that technology and is extremely well educated. What is vital, I argued, is adequate teacher training. But e-learning is also very important, especially in the internet, technology-driven world we live in.</p><p>For Africa it can be a valuable tool in improving access to education. For example, to produce textbooks and distribute them across schools is hugely expensive and very difficult. Whereas online access to information such as teaching resources and lesson plans, which can be used to build a curriculum, is cheap and easy once the technology and infrastructure is in place and the teacher is trained to use it.</p><p><strong>What are some of the themes in this year's conference?</strong></p><p>One of the main themes is the youth. There is a skills deficit that is preventing them from progressing and we want to open a discussion on ways to address this.</p><p>We will also discuss whether Africa should adopt a western higher education model or create different kinds of programmes. Also, how to use technology to attract young people to working in agriculture. And we want to connect <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/23/u-s-investments-surge-for-african-tech-entrepreneurs/\" title=\"\">the many new African IT entrepreneurs</a> with policymakers, so governments know what tools or infrastructure they need to enhance and support what they are doing.</p><p><strong>What are some of the challenges facing the organisation?</strong></p><p>One of our main challenges is trying to keep ahead of trends while also trying to maintain a balance and not get swept up in empty hype. There are a lot of hot topics in the education-technology sector at the moment, and while we need to reflect these changes in our conference programmes, there is a danger of losing sight of the less rock star basic elements, which may often be more impactful in the long term.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for the organisation?</strong></p><p>To continue to be a great enabler for development in Africa, to raise awareness of what can be done and give people access to the information and technology to accomplish it. It is also important to get governments to realise the value of teachers and ensure they have the tools and environment they need to do their jobs. Education is the key to understanding and democracy, and in Africa it is vital tool for development and empowerment.</p><p><strong>Read more content like this: </strong><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/oct/11/day-of-the-girl-early-pregnancy-education-kenya\">Bringing education to young mothers through mobiles</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jan/24/digital-divide-access-to-information-africa\">Access to information: bridging the digital divide in Africa</a><br />• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/mar/13/technology-civil-society-policy\">Technology: using power for good</a></p><p><strong>Join the community of global development professionals and experts. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\" title=\"\"><strong>Become a GDPN member</strong></a><strong> to get more stories like this direct to your inbox</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/22/1400757681971/Rebecca-Stromeyer-002.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/26/elearning-africa-education-conference","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/26/elearning-africa-education-conference","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"9 ways to harness tech for development","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-20T14:01:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/20/technology-for-development","fields":{"body":"<h2><strong>Ranjit Devraj, regional coordinator for South Asia, </strong><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scidev.net%2Fglobal%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcOGuPNxEZKhAurgO7dXC3lVhGag\" title=\"\"><strong>SciDev.Net</strong></a><strong>, New Delhi, India. </strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FSciDevNet_SA&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVz0HyqGY1-P4riC_WqqRF9fbWmg\" title=\"\"><strong>@SciDevNet_SA</strong></a></h2><p><strong>Don't be discouraged by illiteracy: </strong>Curiously, it is illiterate Indians who are making the best use of the digital technology on mobile phones equipped with cameras.

In the last 10 years, I was the permanent secretary, ministry of information and communications, Kenya. In my first few years in the civil service, I pushed for the supply-side of the internet when the entire eastern Africa was not connected to the rest of the world through fibre optics. Today, I am actively involved in the demand-side of the internet, mostly advocating for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/apr/28/global-development-digital-arabic-content\" title=\"\">local content development</a>.</p><p><strong>How much impact has the internet had on Africa in its first 25 years?</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/activate\" title=\"\">The internet has changed Africa</a>. It has deepened financial services in the continent beyond the imaginations of many people globally. The internet is greatly contributing to economic growth in Africa and creating new jobs that had never existed. Africa is talking its way into productivity with services now closer to citizens. Farmers are getting value out of their produce as they receive pricing information on their mobile phones. Governments in Africa are also gearing up to use the mobile platform to offer government services.</p><p>The mobile internet is delivering many more services to the people than was envisaged just a few years ago. Young people are leveraging broadband to innovate. Less than 10 years ago, you would not have found the words \"Africa\" and \"innovation\" in the same sentence, but now new applications have changed this and Africa is truly making major contributions globally.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/lions_go_digital_the_internets_transformative_potential_in_africa\" title=\"\">The recent McKinsey report, Lions go Digital: The Internet's Transformative Potential in Africa</a> estimates that in the next 10 years, the internet will contribute as much as $300bn in GDP and a similar amount in productivity gains. E-commerce will grow from virtually nothing today to more than $75bn. The internet's impact has already been felt and will continue to be felt. It is one innovation that has touched the life of every human being.</p><p><strong>What do you see the big challenges and opportunities for African internet being in the next 25, both internally and globally?</strong><br />The big challenge in the next 25 years is to connect more than 7bn people on earth to the internet. Much of the connectivity is concentrated in urban areas. Most rural places still do not have access to the internet. Secondly, affordability is a major issue considering the fact that many people still live on less than two dollars a day.</p><p>The internet is being targeted increasingly by governments that want to control access to the web. This will greatly impact the full potential of the internet if nations fail to create an enabling environment that stimulates growth of its use. Cybersecurity will continue to be a challenge and may become a major roadblock to greater use of the internet. If it is not secure, people will not trust greater penetration of the web.</p><p><strong>How is technology changing the spread of information? What impact does this have on governments and activism?</strong><br />Technology has changed the way that information is created and dispersed. Social media has not only challenged media houses but has come with new ways of spreading information. New applications around visualisation have made it simpler to present information in a way that many people can understand.</p><p>Governments are becoming more responsive to their citizens given the fact that most governments are now on social media. Governance is slowly but surely being changed. Activists are also leveraging social media to push their agenda. Some of the trending issues like #someonetellkenya, raise serious matter that some years back required great mobilisation to get the point across to government.</p><p><strong>You pushed for digitised data within government but met strong resistance. Why – and did you manage to overcome these problems? Is this good for Kenya?</strong><br />Our digitisation programme succeeded to some extent. Several infrastructural issues needed to be dealt with. We needed to change several pieces of information such as the Official Secrets Act which would not allow storage in more secure facilities that may not be available locally. We could not leverage cloud computing since some of the terminologies were not defined within the law. Nevertheless, we pushed on with the agenda impacting the Companies Registry as well as the court of appeal, before we hit headwinds when we tried to digitise the Lands Registry. The resistance mainly came from the people who legally benefited from a chaotic system. The little digitisation of the Lands Registry saw the revenue rise from 800m shillings to 9bn shillings in six months.</p><p>We managed to digitise some registries although we could have done better. We needed to build an army of supporters both from within and outside, but we had mixed reactions which delayed the project. However, we had laid the foundation upon which more digitisation will happen. This was good for the country since it was proof that we can fight governance matters through digitisation.</p><p><strong>You are the honorary chair of the Alliance for Affordable Internet. What are its goals, and why? When do you want to achieve them by?</strong><br />The Alliance for Affordable Internet, or A4AI, is a coalition of members from the public, private and not-for-profit sectors. Many of the world's leading technology companies, governments and civil society organisations are on board. A4AI's primary goal is to see the <a href=\"http://www.broadbandcommission.org/Documents/Broadband_Targets.pdf\" title=\"\">UN Broadband Commission Broadband Target of entry-level broadband services priced at less than 5% of average monthly income achieved</a>.</p><p>Today, innovative technologies are emerging that make affordable access possible, but often they are held back by bad laws or outdated regulations. That's why we are working directly with governments around the world to improve policy and regulatory frameworks and ensure that in the next five years, billions more people globally can afford to get online.</p><p>The internet has a great transformative potential that can positively impact on poverty. Research has shown that for every <a href=\" http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTIC4D/Resources/IC4D_Broadband_35_50.pdf.\" title=\"\">10% increase in internet penetration, the economy grows by as much as 1.3%</a>. Cheap, ubiquitous connectivity can also transform vital services such as health, education and banking. We have seen phenomenal change in Kenya where I played a role in pushing to increase internet penetration. We can replicate this success in other countries.</p><p><em>Bitange Ndemo is a keynote speaker at this year's </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/activate-johannesburg\" title=\"\"><em>Activate Johannesburg Summit, 26 June</em></a><em>.

Money transfer operators continue to dominate international transactions, but in Somaliland they have lost ground to Zaad.</p><p>Abdikarim Mohamed Eid, chief executive of Telesom, says people were initially sceptical about the service. \"We had to win their trust. So we convinced employers to pay salaries through Zaad and created an ecosystem. If everybody accepted Zaad, everybody would pay with it.\"</p><p>Within a year, the strategy began to work. Subscriptions increased, and in 2011 Telesom launched Salaam, an Islamic financial institution offering services – including savings accounts, current accounts and small loans – accessible through Zaad. The financial community began to take notice, and promises of a \"cashless economy\" and \"branchless banking\" in the Horn of Africa soon followed.</p><p>Adbullahi Hassan, 24, a money vendor in Hargeisa, says Zaad has changed the way he works. \"We turn paper money into 'Zaad money', so people can walk safe and carry [it] with them.\"</p><p>A stroll through the capital shows that cash still matters, however. The legal tender in Somaliland is the shilling, but Zaad deals in US dollars. Consequently, those most likely to use it are private sector employees, development workers, and recipients of international remittances.</p><p>\"We civil servants are paid in Somaliland shilling,\" said Wali Daud Egal, director of planning at the finance ministry. \"By accelerating the dollarisation of the economy, Zaad props up prices, and this affects us in particular.\"</p><p>The governor of the Bank of Somaliland, Abdi Dirir Abdi, says Zaad \"causes inflation and offends the dignity of our legal tender. In Kenya or Tanzania, mobile money companies use the local currency. Why here is it different?\"</p><p>There are no published studies linking Zaad to inflation, though the service does fall within a regulatory vacuum: Zaad has implemented practices compliant with international anti-money laundering standards, but there is no state regulatory framework and parliamentary discussions about a commercial banking law have dragged on. While celebrating the usefulness of Zaad, many in Somaliland acknowledge Telesom's unchecked influence on the economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, Telesom's rival, Dahabshiil, is launching its own mobile money service, E-Dahab, for Somtel users in June. Dahabshiil, often cited as one of Africa's <a href=\"http://www.somalilanders.net/dahabshiil-story-of-success/\" title=\"\">brightest business stories</a>, acquired Somtel in 2008. Dahabshiil's foray into mobile money will have the benefit of a far-flung network of money transfer agents, allowing Somalilanders abroad to send money home by mobile phone.</p><p>In response, Zaad is going international. After striking a deal with Tawakal and WorldRemit, two money transfer operators, it promises to shake up the remittance business.</p><p>Some say the brewing competition between Telesom and Dahabshiil has laid bare the failure of Somaliland's authorities to monitor or regulate mobile money. Others argue this focus does little to help expand access to financial services. Company bosses believe real financial inclusion will happen only when Somaliland is properly integrated into the global banking system.</p><p>Safyia Cisman Taani, a local consultant for the International Labour Organisation, points to the challenges women face in rural areas. \"They have no collateral to apply for a loan, whatever the means, either in cash or in mobile money,\" she says. \"Often they cannot even open a Zaad account because they lack an ID. Financial inclusion should go hand-in-hand with political inclusion.\"</p><p><em>Travel and reporting for this article was supported by a grant from the European Journalism Centre</em></p><p>&#149; This article was amended on 23 May 2014 to clarify which company was launching the E-Dahab mobile money service.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/5/16/1400250858510/MDG--Mobile-money-platfor-020.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/may/19/somaliland-mobile-money-zaad-inflation-economy-banking-remittance","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2014/may/19/somaliland-mobile-money-zaad-inflation-economy-banking-remittance","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Tête-à-tête with Ashifi Gogo, founder and CEO of Sproxil","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-16T08:55:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/tete-a-tete-ashifi-gog-founder-ceo-sproxil","fields":{"body":"<p>Sproxil is a venture-backed enterprise that provides world-class brand protection services in emerging markets.

Electronic waste is expected to top 60 million tonnes globally by 2017 – an increase of a third in five years.</p><p>Get it wrong and the resulting e-waste is a toxic hazard.

You will even discover a few kilograms of the rare <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2012/jan/13/1\" title=\"\">palladium</a>. This treasure of metals could be an opportunity to turn e-waste into well-paid work.</p><p>Hewlett Packard has had an e-waste management project in Kenya since 2010, but it had much bigger ambitions. While e-waste volumes continue to grow throughout the developing world, modern recycling facilities are still rare. The company wanted to extend its work in Kenya and develop a blueprint for a sustainable recycling system that could be replicated in other developing countries.</p><p>To develop such a blueprint, Hewlett Packard knew it needed a range of partners to break down traditional barriers between the private, public and academic sectors, between bottom-of-the-pyramid individuals and multinational corporations, and between local labour and global marketplaces.</p><p>In addition to Hewlett Packard's expertise, the company brought together a group of recycling experts, financiers, regulators and academics. For recycling knowledge it partnered with the <a href=\"http://www.eastafricancompliantrecycling.net/about-us\" title=\"\">East African Compliant Recycling</a> (EACR). For developing the regulatory environment, the Kenyan authorities came on board, while the University of Northampton delivered recycling training and awareness. A German investment organisation <a href=\"https://www.deginvest.de/International-financing/DEG/\" title=\"\"><em>Deutsche Investitions – und Entwicklungsgesellschaft</em></a> has experience of funding and project management in developing countries.</p><p>Their remit was to develop a system in Kenya  responsibly to separate and dismantle e-waste, including domestic appliances, computers and mobile phones. In addition, the system needed to ensure that Kenyans working on the project received a fair price for the recovered materials.</p><p>The result was east Africa's first large-scale recycling facility, in Nairobi, and Kenya's first-ever registered collection network for e-waste. The micro-businesses that do the collecting receive equipment and training to ensure they meet global standards and have 40 collection points housed in shipping containers.</p><p>There is also a network of collectors who bring e-waste to the shipping containers. Critically, both the micro-businesses and individual collectors are paid fairly.</p><p>\"This is the first model of its kind, not just in Africa but anywhere in the world,\" says Robert Truscott, chief executive of EACR. \"This model is about connecting the collector to the global markets for the materials, and providing them with a fair and transparent price, to ensure they get the maximum value for the waste.\"</p><p>This collaboration is already having positive environmental, economic and social impacts in Kenya. It is estimated that by the end of 2014, the initiative will have created over 2,000 jobs in Kenya's e-waste management industry. The value created from reusing e-waste is shared between the recycling facility and the collection network of micro-businesses and individuals. Importantly the system allows for a transparent e-payment that passes maximum value down the chain.</p><p>The project's IT system gives the recycling facility full traceability for its flow of material and the financial transactions in the chain. Hewlett-Packard provided funding, IT equipment and IT design expertise, which  used mobile phones and cloud technology.</p><p>To reduce unsafe e-waste disposal practices, Hewlett-Packard supports an information campaign and training, as well as consulting with Kenyan authorities to help develop national legislation, registration and infrastructure for responsible recycling.</p><p>The Guardian judges were impressed with the impact of Hewlett-Packard's project. They praised it for creating a network from scratch and mobilising suppliers, governments and individuals.</p><p>Hewlett-Packard's sustainability strategy dates back to 1957 when its founders first put global citizenship on its corporate agenda. Since then, it has recycled over a billion kilogrammes of IT equipment from 70 countries. In Africa, it has e-waste recycling projects in Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa.</p><p><em>Nicolette Fox is part of the </em><a href=\"http://www.wordworksbysea.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>wordworks network</em></a></p><p><strong>The </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Sustainable Business</strong></a><strong> Sustainability Case Studies contain articles on all the initiatives that met the criteria for the GSB Awards.</strong></p><p><em>  </em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/2/1399029839170/Hewlett-Packard-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-hewlett-packard-ewaste-recycling-africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-hewlett-packard-ewaste-recycling-africa","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"Bond NGO awards celebrate collaboration in complex times","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-13T10:02:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/may/13/bond-ngo-awards-winners","fields":{"body":"<p>In a complex world a simple intervention from a single agency is seldom enough to make lasting change, and we can't afford wasteful duplication.&nbsp;</p><p>That's why increasingly we're seeing NGOs working together with other NGOs, north and south, public and private sector partners and bringing in those with expertise to deliver holistic solutions.</p><p>Development organisations have been reluctant to co-operate, fearful of working with the corporate world or seeing other NGOs as competitors. There can indeed be a tension between shared learning and collaborative approaches and the hard-nosed competitive advantage required to win large government contracts for development programmes.</p><p>But genuine collaboration shouldn't be driven by funding opportunities. It should be a strategic choice to achieve better outcomes, costs efficiencies and to bring skills or experience together that enable greater depth and reach.

The Saferworld team brought together community leaders from across all the ethnic and religious groups as well as other local NGOs, the independent electoral boundaries commission and most importantly, the security forces, to build trust, identify potential hotspots, strengthen preparedness, diffuse tension and maintain peace and save lives in the elections.</p><p><a href=\"http://streetchildworldcup.org/\" title=\"\">Street Child United</a> won in the small organisation category.

Prahalad advocated for envisioning those at the bottom of the economic pyramid as producers and consumers of products, rather than merely as philanthropic beneficiaries. </p><p>Ten years later, several large companies have adopted Prahalad's ideas and, in the process, have demonstrated that serving the \"base of the pyramid\" consumer can make good business sense. I analyzed several of these \"base of the pyramid\" business models — what we call \"Building a Marketplace\" — in <a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/library/model-behavior#.Uzwnl_a1n4h\">Model Behavior: 20 Business Model Innovations for Sustainability</a>, a report that I co-wrote and released earlier this year. </p><p>In the report, I showed that when companies deploy this model, they build new markets for their products in innovative and socially responsible ways. Among other things, this can include delivering social programs, adapting to local markets and bundling with other services like microfinance and technical assistance.</p><h2>Improving healthcare in India</h2><p>The pharmaceutical company Novartis implemented the building a marketplace model through its Arogya Parivar initiative, a for-profit effort to improve health in poor, rural communities in India without access to affordable healthcare. </p><p>Using a \"1 plus 1 education\" strategy, Arogya Parivar employs health educators to instruct villagers on a variety of health topics, thereby creating greater confidence in medicine. An accompanying supervisor, the \"plus one\", educates doctors, service providers and pharmacies, and assesses an area's needs. </p><p>Rather than solely focusing on selling products to a market, Novartis has taken on the challenge of empowering entire communities by educating potential customers – along with those who assess health and provide medicine – about their community health needs. To ensure the program's success, Novartis has altered its product pricing structure, making medications available in small packs at affordable prices. In most cases, the cost doesn't exceed $1.25 a week. </p><p>Arogya Parivar started in 2007 as a pilot program in South India. Since then, it  has spread to ten Indian states and now reaches more than 40 million people. <a href=\"http://www.businesscalltoaction.org/wp-content/files_mf/bctacasestudy_novartis_web.pdf\">Novartis reports</a> that the program broke even within 30 months. Recently, the company expanded it to Kenya and Vietnam, and plan to open in Indonesia. </p><p>The road to scale has not been easy, and Novartis has had to invest in an entirely new business ecosystem. However, by doing so, the company aims to earn trust, brand allegiance and revenue from a new group of consumers who might have increased spending power in the future.   </p><h2>Microfinance in Mexico</h2><p>On the other side of the world in Mexico, Cemex, a company in an entirely different industry, has taken a similar approach to building a new marketplace. Over 100 years old, the company is one of the world's largest building materials suppliers and cement producers. Sixteen years ago, it established the Patrimonio Hoy program, which makes building materials like cement, concrete blocks and steel available to low-income urban and peri-urban communities at market rates. </p><p>Although its prices are often on par, or slightly higher, than those of its competitors, Patrimonio Hoy offers greater value. Through the program, customers are able to access microfinance loans that allow them to pay for the products over time. Patrimonio Hoy also offers technical assistance and architectural guidance for customers, nearly all of whom construct their own homes. </p><p>Patrimonio Hoy doesn't just sell to communities; it also works within their existing social structures. Key to the success of the model is its network of community-based promoters, usually women, who tell friends and family members about the company and its program. Promoters are rewarded on a commission basis for every customer they bring in. </p><p>Through Patrimonio Hoy, Cemex has supplied affordable building materials and services, along with more than $135m in microcredit, to finance the construction of new homes for 420,000 families. The program has had an outsize impact in some communities, creating new jobs for local masons, increasing property values, and enabling the establishment of home-based businesses. </p><h2>Selling insurance via mobile phones in Zambia</h2><p>MicroEnsure, a global insurance provider, is building marketplaces in a slightly different way, leaning on local partners to secure customers and market its products. Working in emerging markets, in which at least 95% of the population is uninsured, MicroEnsure faces an uphill battle: Customers are reticent to buy a product that they might need in three years. </p><p>Rather than selling insurance directly to customers, MicroEnsure handles the product design, technology platform and call center for its products, but works with local insurance providers to shoulder the risk. It also collaborates with mobile phone service providers, who have established relationships and brand recognition, to market its products. The mobile providers offer insurance to existing customers for free upfront for six months, and then invite them to pay a small fee, about $1 per month, to continue their coverage. The mobile providers are willing to pay the cost of the premium to MicroEnsure because the insurance makes mobile customers less likely to switch providers and more likely to increase the amount they spend. </p><p>Together, with local partners, MicroEnsure is building an entirely new insurance marketplace. The model appears to be working: MicroEnsure currently serves seven million customers around the world and is growing monthly. Earlier this year, the company entered Zambia, where previously only 1% of the population was insured.

The Commission could not approve a response by the required four affirmative votes as to whether MYL may acquire goods and services with bitcoins it receives as contributions.&quot;</p> <p>Because the commission only ruled on the specific request that Make Your Laws made, the only explicit limit on bitcoin donations is $100, which is the amount the Pac decided to cap donations at. The question of whether or not larger donations could be made, potentially up to the $2,600 limit for US candidates, is left open.</p> <p>The ruling also does not explicitly address other crypto-currencies, such as Litecoin or Dogecoin, but does set a precedent.

Numbers are improving week in week out and we’re seeing signs of improved competitiveness in the periphery. But let’s not forget there are still deep rooted underlying problems. Inflation remains disturbingly low and there are mumblings that economic recovery could falter if euro strength is sustained. What’s more, the general state of the emerging markets has meant a slowdown in these economies has kept a lid on global trade and continued to put downward pressure on tradable goods prices. Ukraine remains a lurking concern. If these issues become worse, Draghi may find himself with little choice but to step in and to bring Europe back to health. Further rate reductions may be the first step but the most likely remedy would be buying of assets through quantitative easing-European style.</p> <p>So far Draghi has done a sound job of talking the talk, and often talking is almost as good as doing it. But investors are starting to look for actual movement - ‘Will he, won’t he’ has kept many on their toes for several months already. In part because Europe is seen to be recovering in spite of these underlying issues. So far, Draghi hasn’t needed to make a move. However, his positioning in Europe creates an air of uncertainty, adding to the clouds of unease already hovering over many part of the globe. Murky markets in the UK, US and Asia have meant many investors are fairly muted in their risk. By the end of the year we expect the clouds to have cleared for Europe, and quite possibly the UK too, but until then all eyes will be on Draghi’s next move, followed by the China, and then the BOJ. Waiting for policy makers is the new investment normal in a post financial crisis world.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-536b757be4b0ece0827b0cd5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-08T13:16:01.595+01:00\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CharltonEmma/statuses/464372802708324352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ECB&amp;src=hash\">#ECB</a> doing nothing gives the euro a little push higher -- will Draghi talk it back down? <a href=\"http://t.co/ZgP1G7nPa0\">pic.twitter.com/ZgP1G7nPa0</a></p>&mdash; Emma Charlton (@CharltonEmma) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CharltonEmma/statuses/464372802708324352\">May 8, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-536b7052e4b0e79669593193\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-08T12:57:45.104+01:00\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-98a38b02-7131-4ecc-91f1-d82b3c668dd8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399550222504/28b43d1d-7fcd-4bbd-b9d1-23f527d0c4c9-460x279.png\" alt=\"Euro against the US dollar, May 08 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Euro against the US dollar, May 08 2014 Photograph: /Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>The Euro has hit a two-month high of $1.3690 against the US dollar</b>, following the ECB&apos;s decision not to change interest rates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/statuses/464372568171237376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Phew...

You can look forward to a wider variety of topics and a frontpage that is much more fluid than today&apos;s frontpage.&quot;<br /></p> <p>Any user on Reddit can create a subreddit devoted to one particular topic, and any other user can then subscribe to it. The site&apos;s administrator team are extremely hands-off when it comes to what goes on in those user-made forums, which cover nearly every topic imaginable, from <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/trees\">cannabis</a> to <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/baking\">baking</a>.</p> <p>This hands-off attitude has got Reddit in trouble in the past, thanks to users creating subreddits such as &quot;jailbait&quot;, devoted to sexualised photos of under-18s, and &quot;creepshots&quot;, which featured sexualised photos of women taken without their knowledge or consent. Both of those <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/internet/2012/10/reddit-blocks-gawker-defence-its-right-be-really-really-creepy\">were eventually closed</a>, but only after a widespread campaign forced the site&apos;s administrators to drop their normally laissez-faire stance.</p> <p>The Reddit staff do have to make some decisions, however, and the default subreddits are one such example. These are the subforums shown to logged-out users, and the ones to which new members are automatically subscribed. Originally, they were picked from the most popular subreddits, but now the site&apos;s administrators exert more influence, promoting good subreddits and demoting flawed or over-played ones.</p> <p>&quot;Most of the old default set was selected based on user activity and interest from years ago,&quot; says Angel. &quot;Reddit has grown and changed so much over the years that it&apos;s only fair to increase the number of subreddits so we can showcase newer subreddits that reflect the interests of the current userbase.

Upcoming major sporting events – the Fifa World Cup in 2014 and Olympic Games in 2016 — are expected to bring a new dynamism to industries such as tourism, commerce and services.</p><p>As industries in Brazil increase their growth predications for the coming years, should the country's youth be reassured of their prospects?</p><p>There is a growing demand in the Brazilian economy for workers in the service industries, with a particular focus on values and behaviours, rather than technical knowledge. But for families living in poverty, access to education opportunities that would help acquire these skills remain limited.</p><p>Fortunately, the recognition of the need to increase youth employment has been growing among the country's policymakers since the early 2000s.  There are 16 federal youth programmes including the <a href=\"http://portal.mte.gov.br/politicas_juventude/projovem-trabalhador-1.htm\" title=\"\">Provojem Trabalhador</a>, preparing young people for the labour market, <a href=\"http://portal.mec.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17462&amp;Itemid=817\" title=\"\">Projovem Urbano</a> which has an education focus and <a href=\"http://pronatec.mec.gov.br/index.php\" title=\"\">Pronatec</a>, which helps young people acquire technical skills.</p><p>First job programmes have also been promoted. It is now mandatory for large and medium-sized businesses to hire teenagers and young people between 14 and 24 years for a period of up to two years. They are hired by companies as apprentices, which also makes it compulsory for young participants to attend school or training institutions. According <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/els/emp/R_SZATMARTI-Quality%20Apprenticeships%20%E2%80%93%20OECD%20%E2%80%93%20Brazil.pdf\" title=\"\">to current legislation</a>, the percentage of apprentices in a company needs to be between 5% and 15% of the workforce.</p><p>The government has high hopes that coming sporting events, will further improve the situation. The main work opportunities related to the World Cup are in construction, information technology, tourism, retail, services, clothing, wood and furniture and agribusiness.</p><p>While these events provide an opportunity they are not necessarily the silver bullet. The real challenge will be in translating these opportunities into long-term employment. The majority of young people in Brazil enter the labour market into precarious jobs, and once they begin working, they often drop out of school, making it difficult for them to access better work in the future. This starts a cycle of economic insecurity and instability that follows them throughout adulthood.</p><p>The key to breaking the cycle is ensuring that young people have adequate education as well as access to on the job training. <a href=\"http://www.plan-uk.org/\" title=\"\">Plan International</a> in partnership with the Arena das Dunas, the World Cup stadium in Natal, has been working with local young people struggling to find work.</p><p>The programme <a href=\"http://www.plan-uk.org/news/news-and-features/goals-for-better-life-brazil-wordcup2014/\" title=\"\">Goals for a better life</a> which was launched at the start of the year, will in the  short-term employ 150 vulnerable young peopleas stewards and hosts during and after the event. The selected youth are from historically deprived communities.  Frequently they come from violent backgrounds, have little or no access to quality education, and struggle to access the formal job market. This often leaves them at risk of getting involved in illegal activities.</p><p>To ensure that the young people benefit from the experience in the long-term we intend to develop their life skills – as <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fmental_health%2Fmedia%2Fen%2F30.pdf&amp;ei=LA1qU6iIFOap7AbQk4CoCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGC9It46MwzrAf9Z5HJ-FFmX0gffA&amp;sig2=Lbr-XsGPLW0xMc75DFY6xQ&amp;bvm=bv.66111022,d.ZGU\" title=\"\">defined by the World Health Organisation</a>. This includes the capacity to deal with stress, assertive communication and critical thinking. These abilities empower young people to have a healthier interaction with the job market as well as their own families and communities.</p><p>The next phase of the project will offer vulnerable youths more in-depth vocational training and coaching for a full-time job. The goal is to establish a sustainable training and business centre at the stadium.</p><p>The Fifa World Cup presents a real opportunity for Brazil's young people, but lowering unemployment numbers in the short term is not enough. The opportunities need to remain long after the tourists and athletes have returned home. Neither the government nor the development community can do it alone. Working in partnership as Goals for a better life tries to do is the only way to provide employment that is not only decent, but also long-term.</p><p><em>Tarcisio Silva is a project development manager at </em><a href=\"https://plan-international.org/where-we-work/americas/brazil/\" title=\"\"><em>Plan International in Brazil</em></a><em>.

Next year's Rugby World Cup is already on course, however, to exceed all its financial targets months before tickets actually go on public sale on 12 September. Apparently the television rights have even been sold in Pakistan, Iceland and Greenland.</p><p>Yet amid the blizzard of upbeat figures – 500,000 tickets will go on sale to affiliated rugby club members from 16 May, £45m of sponsorship deals have already been signed and a record 130,000 tickets have been sold to fans overseas – there remains the significant challenge of transforming a potentially good tournament into a great one.Debbie Jevans, the chief executive of England Rugby 2015, her Rugby Football Union counterpart, Ian Ritchie, and the International Rugby Board's chief executive, Brett Gosper, know it is not just the bottom line which counts.</p><p>Top of the snagging list, inevitably, is naked ticket profiteering: naked as in greed rather than a lack of clothes, although desperate buyers could end up losing their shirts. Already speculators are eager to charge hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds for a seat even at a modest pool game. Samoa versus United States in Brighton? The cheapest seat on one prominent website on Tuesday came in at £209; by the time the World Cup arrives, prices will be even more eye-watering.</p><p>It is a depressing situation which threatens to tug at the tournament's soul. Going to a World Cup game should be a genuinely exciting prospect; feeling exploited long before you reach the ground is a very different sensation.</p><p>But let's be positive and take the organisers at face value when they promise loads of cheerful volunteers – 20,000 have applied for 6,000 positions – vibrant fan zones, widespread bonhomie around the grounds and reasonably priced food and drink. While they cannot guarantee the weather, some sunshine would clearly help, too. Beyond that there are probably three main issues to be addressed if the stated aim of wowing the world à la 2012 Olympics is to be met.</p><p>All three can probably be distilled into one sentence: the ultimate objective is a succession of gripping games played in sold-out, atmospheric arenas involving competitive, positive-minded sides and referees who barely get noticed. The last bit is not a dig at the refereeing community, far from it. It merely reflects the growing reality that rugby union referees – and television match officials – are becoming too influential for comfort.</p><p>Gosper is as aware as anyone that the game's current experiment with greater technological assistance for on-pitch officials is causing ructions. A great World Cup can surely not afford endless delays while replays are consulted, nor the disallowing by TMOs of perfectly good tries, such as the one Waikato Chiefs were denied in their weekend Super 15 game against the Lions for a supposed slight obstruction 40 metres back upfield.</p><p>There is something wrong with a game which elevates excessive nit-picking over thrilling athletic effort, particularly when the world's best players are in the same place at the same time.</p><p>Significantly, the Australian-reared Gosper is also concerned about the implications for broadcasters of stop-start matches running way beyond their allotted span.</p><p>He hinted on Tuesday that the IRB are not entirely relaxed about the way the current trial is going and may tweak certain aspects later this year. \"It's a difficult one because referees are damned if they do and damned if they don't,\" he said. \"Ideally, you don't want the referee to be noticed.\"</p><p>The obvious solution is to keep the cameras but use them more sparingly. Give each captain – not the coach, the captain – one referral per game in case of an absolute howler and tell the referee he can go upstairs only for try decisions, except in the last five minutes when he needs all the help he can get. Not all forward passes, even so, show up clearly on television and carding people for something no one on the field spotted 15 rucks ago is to head too far down the road of correctness.</p><p>Better, surely, to tell the players that a disciplinary panel will sit within 24 hours of the game to debate any contentious incidents and to leave red cards to the discretion of the referee. If something is clear and obvious, fine; if not, standing around debating it for 10 minutes is a passion-killer of the worst kind. Gosper says team referrals, as in cricket, have been discussed but there is no chance of them being introduced for the 2015 tournament.</p><p>\"I don't think it's out of the question in the future but we don't want to change things too significantly at this stage. It's getting too late within the four-year cycle between World Cups.\" He has promised, however, \"to do everything we can\" to help nations such as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga field their best players, rather than allowing wealthy clubs to encourage individuals to declare themselves unavailable for national service.</p><p>The IRB is also promising technical and coaching assistance to whichever of the African minnows – and it could yet be Madagascar or Kenya – qualify in July for a place in New Zealand's pool at the World Cup. The last thing the sport needs is a serious injury to an enthusiastic amateur thrown in against the world's most ruthless professionals. \"We want to create special memories that people never forget,\" stressed Ritchie. In 500 days the big show will be here and the whole game needs to show its best side.</p><p></p><h2>LATE CALL</h2><p>Good luck to all four Championship clubs – Bristol, Rotherham, Leeds Carnegie and London Welsh – about to embark on the play-offs which will lead to one of them being promoted to the Premiership in place of Worcester. They also need our sympathy. What kind of system is it which, with no legal challenges to delay things, does not confirm the promoted club until 4 June, ensuring they have a month less than the majority of Premiership sides in which to prepare for the new campaign? Bristol reported back for pre-season last May; the 12-month season is officially here. One day someone in authority will put the players first. Let us hope it happens sooner rather than later.</p><p></p><h2>PREDICTION OF THE WEEK</h2><p>Harlequins v Bath. One Premiership semi-final place remains to be filled and the winner of Saturday's game at the Stoop, barring the remotest of mathematical possibilities, will fill it.

In&nbsp;his sonorous voice, this man told me a sorry tale of armed soldiers arriving suddenly in his village and wrecking his simple life; he now lives in the world's biggest refugee camp, separated from his wife and six children. With him were three friends, one blinded from childhood, who told similar horror stories of murder, rape and violence.</p><p>This gentle farmer is suing Britain for funding the one-party regime behind a Stalin-style programme of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/22/ethiopia-villagisation-scheme-fails\" title=\"\">\"villagisation\"</a> that is throwing thousands of people off their traditional lands for redistribution to friends of the government or sale to foreign investors. The case is a clear example of the blinkered way an obsession with aid and technocratic solutions to poverty can lead democracies and do-gooders to climb&nbsp;into bed with brutal despots.</p><p>So it was not a surprise to meet Mr O – his name kept secret to protect his family – again in the pages of this impassioned polemic. It takes aim at misguided governments, myopic global institutions and self-appointed gurus such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/billgates\" title=\"\">Bill Gates</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a> who praise the progress of autocracies, brushing aside human-rights violations that set back social and economic advancement. \"The dictator who the experts expect will accomplish the technical fixes to technical problems is not the solution; he is the problem,\" writes Easterly.</p><p>This critique of what the author, a professor of economics at New York University, terms \"authoritarian development\" is correct. He skewers the failure of technocrats to respect the rights of those they claim to be saving from poverty as they impose putative remedies, often imported from abroad with little regard to local conditions. He shows autocracies have a worse record for economic growth than democracies, and argues civil liberties are essential to ensure the free exchange of ideas and innovation that drives success. The&nbsp;word \"innovation\", he points out, was originally a term of abuse.</p><p>The core argument, indicated by the title and made in slightly laboured style, is that freedom must be central to the fight against poverty. But for all its questioning of western arrogance and double-standards, this is not another critique of aid; that battle is increasingly won in academic circles. Instead, and far more interestingly, Easterly – a former World Bank economist – shows off his own expertise as he sweeps through the history of development and economics.</p><p>It is usually assumed development aid began with President Harry S Truman's inaugural speech in 1945, with its <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres53.html\" title=\"\">famous pledge to relieve the suffering of the world's poor</a>. But the author goes back further, tracing its history to China after the turn of the last century. He blames Britain too, saying a colonial official named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Hailey,_1st_Baron_Hailey\" title=\"\">Lord Hailey</a> used technocratic development to replace racism as justification for colonial rule, amid wartime fears of uprisings from oppressed subjects. This set the tone for the cold-war support of dictators.</p><p>His case is shored up with fascinating examples sprinkled throughout the book. These range from&nbsp;the unlikely evolution of the Korean car industry through to the story of Akwapim farmers in 1880s Ghana who discovered by chance that the best way to grow the imported crop of cocoa was on small plantations, mixed with food. The British insisted it should be grown on big plantations, failing to believe that \"primitive local farmers\" had found the most efficient means of&nbsp;production; then after independence&nbsp;these smallholders were&nbsp;almost taxed out of business on&nbsp;the advice of foreign experts.</p><p>Closer to his own home, Easterly tells the story of a block in New York that shows the power of spontaneous development by individuals. Over three centuries, it evolved from being a large farm through to homes for the wealthy, then it was whorehouses, followed by thriving textile factories, only to be spared demolition and colonised by artists before becoming apartments for&nbsp;the rich again and upscale stores.</p><p>Such examples highlight how development bubbles up best from below, especially when people are given freedom to challenge conventional wisdoms – although it would have been good to have seen more positive suggestions for change beyond his critique. He also demonstrates the amazing historical legacy of reform, pointing to one study showing Italian cities that retained freedom in the 12th century remain richer today, and others&nbsp;revealing how slavery still impacts on happiness, trust&nbsp;and success in Africa. Easterly's own research claims that 78% of the income differential between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa can be explained by technologies that were in&nbsp;place by 1500.</p><p>This is a provocative book that will rile the development world. But it deserves to be read by all those technocrats who jet around the planet with their simplistic top-down solutions, often ignoring rights they themselves take for granted. Ultimately, it is a timely blast against the complacency of those who think progress and prosperity can be detached from politics. \"We must not let caring about the material suffering of the poor change the subject from caring about the rights of the poor,\" says the author, rightly.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/4/28/1398702869082/Heat-and-dust-displaced-S-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/05/the-tyranny-of-experts-william-easterly-review-development","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/may/05/the-tyranny-of-experts-william-easterly-review-development","sectionName":"Books"},{"webTitle":"The war on poaching cannot be won in the field unless we take on high-level corruption | Paula Kahumbu","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-05T06:30:47Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/africa-wild/2014/may/05/war-on-poaching-cannot-be-won-unless-we-take-on-corruption","fields":{"body":"<p><br />In order to win the war against poaching we have to understand its causes. There are two main explanations for why poaching is endemic and so hard to eradicate in developing countries.<br /></p> <p>The first explanation is that poaching is driven by organised crime. A recent, widely publicised report by Born Free: “<a href=\"http://www.bornfreeusa.org/a9_ivorys_curse.php \">Ivory’s Curse: The Militarisation and Professionalisation of Poaching in Africa</a>”, details the web of corruption linking crime cartels to government officials, army officers and businessmen. <br /></p> <p>In buying the services of the individuals they need to oil the wheels of their criminal enterprises, the cartels achieve a degree of high level cooperation between the public and private sectors that development agencies can only dream of.<br /></p> <p>Evidence of the inner workings of crime syndicates is, naturally, hard to come by. But there is plenty of evidence of the involvement of corrupt officials and police officers in the illegal wildlife trade, such as the <a href=\"https://uk-mg42.mail.yahoo.com/neo/launch?.rand=197v0dq02as5m#8453854638\">recent arrest of two police officers in Kenya</a>. <br /></p> <p>In its conclusions, the Born Free report in calls for anti-poaching investment to be strategically re-focused on the traffickers and cartels. <br /></p> <p>The second explanation is that poaching is driven by poverty. An earlier <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/01/02/africa-investment-idINDEEA0107G20140102 \">IUCN report</a> on elephant poaching provides statistics showing that child mortality and other povert indicators are correlated to poaching intensity. The general conclusion is that poverty drives people to poach. <br /></p> <p>In this scenario poachers are victims of poverty, but they are also the actual killers of elephants and rhinos, and this is where most governments currently have to invest anti-poaching efforts. But in the longer-term the only sustainable solution is development, to alleviate the poverty that is the cause of poaching. <br /></p> <p>There is no reason to believe that these two very different explanations contradict one another. Both are almost certainly true. The trade in ivory and other illegal wildlife products is complex, diverse and constantly evolving, like any other trade. Like any other business enterprise, the crime cartels are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities to maximize their profits.<br /></p> <p>But: how are these two causes of poaching interconnected? In weighing up the evidence, we should bear the following points in mind:<br /></p> <p>(1) People are not criminals because they are poor. Africa is full of inspiring stories of community-based conservation and development initiatives: stories of poor people trying to make an honest living, using natural resources sustainably.<br /></p> <p>(2) You don&apos;t have to be poor to be a criminal. <a href=\"http://www.theecologist.org/investigations/natural_world/1380947/how_rhino_horn_poaching_fuels_criminal_gangs_in_uk_and_europe.html\">Rhino horns are regularly the target of thieves in the UK</a> as well – here also there is evidence that the crime cartels are in the background, masterminding operations.<br /></p> <p>(3) Any high-value, lightweight product is going to attract the attention of organised crime cartels, be it drugs, diamonds or illegal wildlife products.<br /></p> <p>Note that it is value of the product that matters, not whether or not it is intrinsically &quot;illegal&quot;. Cartels deal in prescription drugs as well as banned substances, in diamonds as well as rhino horns. This puts paid to arguments that legalising trade in rhino horn is the way to stop poaching.<br /></p> <p>Let’s look again at the conclusions of the IUCN report which shows a correlation between poaching and poverty. One of the first things that students of statistics are taught is that a correlation does not provide proof of causality. Poverty could be the cause of poaching, but the causal process could go in the other direction: could poaching could be the cause of poverty?<br /></p> <p>This might sound far-fetched, but poaching does contribute to poverty, by impoverishing communities of their natural capital which could be sustainably harvested or used through tourism for the benefit of wider society. <br /></p> <p>Poaching also introduces corruption and criminality into communities, leading to the incarceration of young working aged men. The insecurity brought by armed poachers threatens all investments – poachers are known to raid homes and markets for food, steal vehicles and even rape women. <br /></p> <p>The IUCN report finds that while areas where poverty is worst also see higher levels of elephant poaching, poor villagers do not benefit from the illicit ivory trade. Thus incomes for a few poachers are matched by threats to legitimate sources of income, driving the community greater into poverty and potentially into ever greater dependence on the poaching cartels. <br /></p> <p>I would argue that corruption what drives this vicious circle and is the root cause of the current poaching crisis. Corruption is the catalyst that binds poverty to organised crime and activates their full destructive potential. <br /></p> <p>Ingrained corruption in societies gives the cartels freedom of movement to exploit poor people and evade capture. Where corruption is already endemic, it is easy for criminals to further corrupt the system, taking advantage of existing networks developed, for example, for the drugs trade or human trafficking. Where there is no corruption, the cartels will take steps to introduce it.<br /></p> <p>Would a study of the statistics reveal a correlation between corruption and poaching in the MIKE countries? My guess is it would. Certainly there is evidence to support this hypothesis from one country, Botwana. <br /></p> <p>This country has long had a policy of zero tolerance for corruption. In the latest report issued by Transparency International, Botwana <a href=\"http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/\">stands out on the map of Africa as having the continent’s lowest levels of corruption</a> – lower than some European countries. <br /></p> <p>Botwana also has the largest population of elephants in Africa as well as the best record on poaching in Africa. In a desperate measure, <a href=\"http://. http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/13/rhinos-south-africa-botswana-anti-poaching-drive\">Rhinos are now being moved to Botwana</a> to put them beyond the reach of rampant poaching in neighbouring South Africa, where corruption is endemic at all levels of society. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c4b8d750-cd35-4da3-b92e-f763372ee88c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/5/1399252919418/e1cc7e7b-0a6c-42cb-84fb-65d72745cbcc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bungee-launch of a Falcon UAV unpiloted aircraft in a demonstration in Namibia. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drones are being introduced to protect elephants and rhinoceroses in African national parks.

This is a welcome sign of growing global awareness of the urgency of the situation. Wildlife protection agencies need state-of-the-art technology such as night vision equipment to combat the poachers, who are already using it. <br /></p> <p>But technology and manpower alone will not solve the problem so long as corruption is not dealt with. Anti-poaching investments in a country with good governance, like Botswana, will contribute towards effective surveillance and protection. But in corrupt countries, there is a real danger the money will end up funding the poachers instead. <br /></p> <p>In Kenya, there is chilling evidence of how sophisticated surveillance equipment like GPS locators, intended to protected rhinos, is being used by poachers, with the help of corrupt or frightened officials, to locate and target their prey. <br /></p> <p>The recent announcement of a substantial pay rise for Kenyan rangers protecting elephant and rhino sanctuaries is hugely welcome, a sign that the message that morale and commitment are as important as equipment is beginning to get through.<br /></p> <p>The corruption highlighted by Born Free Report is an insidious and largely unspoken and filthy threat, not only to African wildlife, but to society as a whole. But this threat is also an opportunity for environmentalists to achieve their long-held dream of mainstreaming the environment in national policy agendas. <br /></p> <p>To do so, local environmental activists must also become part of the mainstream, by uniting with other social forces in the broader struggle against corruption, and for a fair and just society where humans and animals alike are free to go about their legitimate business.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/5/1399255160050/7b954bd3-4814-4fe7-b3a5-2442c791152d-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2014/may/05/war-on-poaching-cannot-be-won-unless-we-take-on-corruption","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/africa-wild/2014/may/05/war-on-poaching-cannot-be-won-unless-we-take-on-corruption","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Member spotlight: Envirofit International","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-23T16:57:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/member-spotlight-envirofit-international","fields":{"body":"<figure data-media-id='gu-image-435240815'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/23/1398270573017/Jessica-Alderman-003.jpg' alt='Jessica Alderman' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Jessica Alderman Photograph: DanBihn.com/EnviroFit International</figcaption></figure><p>Envirofit International, an organization that champions the adoption of cleaner, greener, and more cost-effective cooking technologies, launched a new 100-litre institutional stove in Kenya on 21 March, 2014.</p><p>Household air pollution caused by inefficient cooking on open wood fires and traditional stoves claims more than 15,000 lives in Kenya each year and more than 4m deaths globally. Gaining importance on the international political agenda, clean cooking solutions have attracted support from across the public and private sectors. Envirofit's game-changing launch in Kenya was attended by senior figures including Dr. Mary Okello, director of the Makini School, Dr. Manu Chandaria, chairman of the Comcraft group and Robert Godec, United States Ambassador to Kenya.</p><p>The majority of previous attention has been drawn to households, where half the world's population cooks over an open fire. However, inefficient fuel burning also burns a major hole in schools' pockets. A school that feeds 300 students may use 18,000 kg of wood per year – as much as two double-decker buses. Recent reports suggest that schools offering meals to students have on average 28% higher enrolment – yet providing lunch can also place a large financial burden on schools, many of which spend 20-50% of their annual budget on fuel.</p><p>Envirofit's institutional stove has been designed with a high-performing combustion chamber that burns wood more efficiently – decreasing harmful emissions and fuel consumption by up to 90%. State-of-the-art technology and design have been employed to create a product that schools can afford – with only one third of the annual fuel bill.</p><p>\"Our chef would begin cooking at 6am and often lunch would not be ready for the children at 1pm. Now she starts at 10am and never misses a meal,\" says school headmaster Titus Ktoko, the first recipient of the institutional stove. \"With the new institutional stove, we can cook a meal for 300 students with just three pieces of wood.\"</p><p>The stove has also created positive impacts within Kenya's Ngelani community. Regina Musyimi, a parent who helps to supply firewood to the school, reported that, \"It used to take me four or five days to collect firewood for the school for one week. Now it takes me only two or three days.\"</p><p>Impact in the community extends beyond firewood since the stove also helps to educate the community about clean cooking. \"When we launched  the parents saw how it was consuming less firewood, they wanted stoves for their homes too,\" said Mr. Ktoko. \"We then contacted Envirofit and they were able to supply the community with household stoves as well.\"</p><p>According to Ron Bills, CEO of Envirofit, \"Through working with schools, we can demonstrate the economic and social benefits of adopting clean-cooking technology to households. 84% of Kenya's population uses charcoal and wood cookstoves – with families spending as much as 30% of their annual income on fuel costs. When you use these traditional types of stoves, 90% of the fuel's energy is wasted and the smoke generated is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.\"</p><p>Envirofit is the world's leading clean cookstove business, producing high-performing biomass cookstoves that are efficient, durable, desirable, and affordable for households and institutions in developing nations. It was founded in 2003 to develop well-engineered technology solutions that address global energy and health challenges. In 2007, Envirofit partnered with the Shell Foundation to create a viable clean cookstove business. Its mission is to create products that reduce pollution and energy dependence while yielding health, environmental, and economic improvements. Using a market-based approach, Envirofit has pioneered the clean cookstove market, selling more than 700,000 stoves and impacting over 3.5m livelihoods across 45 countries.</p><p>By promoting behavior change at the community level, Envirofit aims to influence communities to transform household cooking practices. Envirofit is also working with corporations such as Kaluworks to explain the health benefits of clean cooking and make cookstoves more widely available.</p><p>The initial cost of the stove can be a barrier for schools, however Envirofit has partnered with Equity Bank to assist schools with financing the purchase. These schools can then benefit from huge savings since the stove pays for itself in less than six months.</p><p>Kenya is the first country in which Envirofit will offer institutional stoves to schools and other community services such as hospitals and prisons – sparking a wave of interest from Government, industry associations and other institutions at the launch. Envirofit expects to install 1,000 stoves in Kenya by 2015 and to make the product available across Africa later this spring.</p><p><em>Jessica Alderman is director of communications for Envirofit International</em></p><p><em>Launched at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.un.org/\">United Nations</a>, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.businesscalltoaction.org/\">Business Call to Action</a> (BCtA) is a global alliance hosted by the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.undp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Nations Development Programme</a> Headquarters in New York.

One in three said they read to children from their mobile phones, and 90% of respondents said they would be spending more time reading on their mobile phones in the next year.</p><p>The study, <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/themes/icts/m4ed/mobile-reading/reading-in-the-mobile-era/\" title=\"\">says Unesco in its report</a>, found that \"people read more when they read on mobile devices, that they enjoy reading more, and that people commonly read books and stories to children from mobile devices\".</p><p>\"The study shows that mobile reading represents a promising, if still underutilised, pathway to text,\" says the report, for which Unesco partnered with <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/?gclid=CO6E2tfv9r0CFefMtAodnGIA-Q\" title=\"\">Worldreader</a> – a global not-for-profit organisation that works to bring digital books to readers around the world – and Nokia. \"It is not hyperbole to suggest that if every person on the planet understood that his or her mobile phone could be transformed – easily and cheaply – into a library brimming with books, access to text would cease to be such a daunting hurdle to literacy.\"</p><p>The report's author Mark West said that the key conclusion from the study was that \"mobile devices can help people develop, sustain and enhance their literacy skills\".</p><p>\"This is important because literacy opens the door to life-changing opportunities and benefits,\" said West.</p><p>Reasons given by respondents for reading on mobiles were convenience, affordability and lack of access to books. In Zimbabwe, for example, Unesco said the cost of reading a book on a mobile was between 5 and 6 cents, while a paperback bestseller would cost around $12 (£7); in Nigeria, a mobile book would cost around 1 or 2 cents, based on a mobile broadband rate of $13 per 500 MB of data, while a child's book would cost between $1 and $5.</p><p>Unesco pointed to data from the UN, which shows that of the seven billion people on earth, more than six billion now have access to a working mobile phone. \"Collectively, mobile devices are the most ubiquitous information and communication technology in history,\" says Unesco. \"More to the point, they are plentiful in places where books are scarce.\"</p><p>The most popular genre for readers was romance, the survey found, with the \"romance\" icon on Worldreader Mobile receiving 17% of all 730,787 clicks during the research period. Nineteen of the top 40 books read during the study period were romance novels, with Ravinder Singh's Can Love Happen Twice? the most popular book, followed by the Mills &amp; Boon title The Price of Royal Duty in second, and the Bible in third.</p><p>Kwame Nkrumah's The Great African and Nnedi Okorafor's The Girl with the Magic Hands were also among the most read books between April and June 2013, with the most popular search terms over the period \"sex\", \"Bible\" and \"biology\". Chinua Achebe came in fourth, with \"Things fall apart\", ahead of \"love\" in fifth. Religion was the second most popular genre, said Unesco.</p><p>The survey also found that mobile reading is a \"huge tool of empowerment for women\", said Worldreader's Nadja Borovac. While 77% of mobile readers in developing countries are male, women spend an average of 207 minutes per month reading on their mobile phones, compared to men's 33 minutes. Unesco's report points out that in sub-Saharan Africa, a woman is 23% less likely to own a mobile phone than a man, with the gap widening in the case of data-enabled phones. \"Men use mobiles for reading most, but the most active readers are women,\" said Borovac.</p><p>Almost two-thirds (60%) of respondents cited lack of content as the primary barrier to mobile reading, and a third said they were keen to read to their children from their mobiles if there were more child-friendly material available.</p><p>One respondent, Charles, a teacher in Zimbabwe, said he reads to his class from his mobile, and cited lack of printed content as his main reason for turning to his phone. \"We live in a remote area where there are no libraries, and the books I have in my own small library are the ones which I have already read. So this is now giving me a chance to choose from a variety of fiction titles,\" he said.</p><p>Borovac said that mobile reading was \"not a future phenomenon, but something which is happening today\".</p><p>\"It can really change people's lives,\" she said. \"We work in countries where there is a serious shortage of books but where cell phones are plentiful ...

Today, to offer the full range of high-quality financial services required by the majority of the world's people, we need to find the next major business model to disrupt microcredit.</p><p>But first, what is meant by the term business model and how does it relate to our development world? According to Costas Markides of the London Business School, a business model is the sum of answers to three key questions:</p><p>• Who should I target as customers?</p><p>• What products or services should I offer them and what should be my (differentiated) value proposition?</p><p>• And how should I do this in a cost-efficient way?</p><p>Companies that innovate constantly ask themselves these questions.</p><p>Business model innovation is important. It expands the economic pie by attracting new consumers and encouraging existing ones to consume more. Innovation tends to be disruptive because it conflicts with business systems used by established players. Incumbents often can't cope, so usually new players are the ones to introduce the disruption. The new models often entail lower margins and higher volumes, leverage information and communications technology (ICT) in new ways, and emphasise attributes that differ from the existing business. Let's focus on these last two points: ICT and attributes.</p><p>Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Marc Andreessen once famously said that \"software is eating the world,\" and went on to show how virtually every economic sector was becoming increasingly digitised. Why not ours?</p><p>ICT allows firms to innovate in four ways, by:</p><p>• More profitably reaching customers that most competitors can't serve because the segment seems too small to chase or serve profitably – this can be a new and emerging customer base.</p><p>• Offering a radically new value proposition in an economical way, by emphasising different attributes or adding new benefits at a low cost.</p><p>• Reconfiguring the value chain to deliver more value to customers or get rid of inefficient links in the chain and scaling up much more quickly, thus providing protection from competitive attacks.</p><p>Innovators – disruptors – emphasise product or service attributes different from those emphasised by incumbents. The table below gives a few examples, many of which use technology to lower costs and prices and improve usability. For example, Amazon completely disrupted the bookstore market when it introduced online shopping. While these examples are from the developed world, they offer significant applications to financial inclusion and development work more broadly.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-435143185'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/23/1398253912397/oblong.jpeg' alt='Oblong' width='468' height='248' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>How can we apply these ideas to financial inclusion? This article started out by stating that commercial microfinance (especially microcredit) was disruptive. How do we know this? First, microcredit was not introduced by incumbents (banks), but rather by a new breed of entities fit for purpose such as microfinance institutions, or MFIs.</p><p>Second, the business model tackled all three of the who, what, and how questions. MFIs target low-income customers not currently served – thus expanding the pie beyond bank customers. The product itself deviated significantly from the norm by accepting nontraditional collateral such as group guarantees or movable assets, and did not rely on audited financial statements or business plans to make loan underwriting decisions. For MFIs, viability depended on customers taking out serial loans of increasing value, and that seemed to be a reasonable bet given that most were capital starved. The delivery model also shifted radically, with the MFI going to the customer rather than the other way around. Microfinance retained the banker's emphasis on personal relationships but with loan officers walking, riding bicycles, or taking buses to get to their customers.</p><p>Microcredit has been a huge success for a relatively narrow band of customers such as market vendors – borrowers with high-turnover businesses concentrated in high-density geographies. Something like 200 to 300 million people enjoy these services worldwide.</p><p>But – and here's a controversial statement – the microcredit market as we know it today is saturated. The thing is, not everyone is a microentrepreneur with a high-turnover business living in a high-density area. And not everyone wants to be in debt all the time. However, everyone needs a range of financial services.</p><p>This is why we need business model disruption, especially in Africa where many people are farmers and live in low-density locations.</p><p>The good news is that we've already seen the beginning of this next disruption: mobile money. In 1998, there were around 4 million mobile phones in Africa – today there are more than 800 million (rising to an estimated 1.1 billion by 2017). That's a penetration rate of around 80%, compared to something like 20% with bank accounts.</p><p>So, as William Gibson once said, the future is here, it's just unevenly distributed. Globally, mobile money is taking off, with more than 30 million active users, most in Africa. In 2012 , the GSMA estimated that mobile money users made more transactions than PayPal, and used more than 500,000 registered agents – equal to the number of Western Union agents. In Kenya, Madagascar, Tanzania, and Uganda there are more mobile money accounts than bank accounts, and the transactions represent serious percentages of GDP.</p><p>Here's the key from a disruptive business model perspective: at least 70% of this business is being done by mobile phone operators, not banks. Once again, a new, relatively unexpected player has swooped into the space and taken the market by storm. Not even MFIs have been able to make this happen at the scale of the mobile operators (although this is starting to change).</p><p>In Kenya, we're seeing a whole new generation of businesses riding the rails of MPesa and other mobile money platforms, offering other financial services, enabling transportation, and supporting agriculture, energy, water, and health care outreach. Is software eating the world in Kenya?</p><p>As exciting as <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1nd1MYW&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFz_wBX3s28-7ZhRe_YHlIm2pK64A\" title=\"\">mobile money</a> is, still only a few deployments are really making it at scale. Why? Because <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1nd1MYW\" title=\"\">mobile money</a> is a highly disruptive business model. Mobile money is particularly tricky to get right on the who and how dimensions of the business model. Evidence reveals that most service providers systematically under-commit and under-invest in two things: customer acquisition and marketing (understanding the customer), and distribution (building a ubiquitous yet viable agent network). It may be that totally new providers will come into the market and tackle these kinds of challenges in a completely different way. For example, technology platform providers are increasingly entering the mobile money space.</p><p>But for those who believe in the power of disruption and are willing to double down on new models like mobile money, the potential is enormous. It may be impossible for us to anticipate what will happen next in the financial inclusion field and the broader economic development space. Our lifetime has seen a technology revolution that our grandparents could never have anticipated or grasped. Our challenge may be the one sometimes attributed to Michelangelo: \"The greatest danger for most of us,\" he is said to have said, \"is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1ncZUPZ&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFr0Vr1DudyC2m2eMfZHZ8XBgcOpw\" title=\"\"><em>Brigit Helms</em></a><em> is the director of the USAid-funded </em><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1nd02ie&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEEI4RmH85n_GHoTy5srpQd7k3nAw\" title=\"\"><em>Speed</em></a><em> project in Mozambique.</em></p><p><strong>Content on this page is produced and controlled by DAI</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/23/1398253491911/Market-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/dai-partner-zone/disruption-in-financial-inclusion","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/dai-partner-zone/disruption-in-financial-inclusion","sectionName":"DAI partner zone"},{"webTitle":"How can charities balance innovation and risk? – live discussion","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-20T10:38:00Z","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","id":"voluntary-sector-network/2014/apr/20/balancing-innovation-and-risk-charities-live-discussion","fields":{"body":"<p>In last month's <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/budget-2014\" title=\"\">budget</a>, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/mar/21/budget-2014-tax-spending-visualised\" title=\"\">Chancellor warned</a> there is still a long way to go when it comes to economic recovery.</p><p>The continuing welfare reforms mean charities are facing the challenge of increased demand and decreased funding, alongside rapid advancements in technology and how we communicate.</p><p>However, the sector continues to innovate and embrace new thinking about how they fundraise, operate and work with service users and the public.</p><p>Join us on Wednesday 23 April from 12–1.30pm to discuss how charities are reacting to the economic climate and preparing for the future.

Demand is apparently outweighing supply, and according to a <a href=\"http://www.esa.doc.gov/Reports/stem-good-jobs-now-and-future\">recent US government report</a>, jobs in the sector will grow at nearly twice the rate of all other occupations by 2018. </p><p>President Obama in particular has pushed for STEM-education to take center stage, and last year allocated $3.1bn to improving training in the field. </p><p>But to make a real difference, more money and real-world input is needed, and that's where corporations come in. A new wave of companies are entering into education, both at home and in emerging markets, to help bridge the skills gap. </p><p>While focus has been placed on careers that involve dedicated tertiary study, the new crop of corporation-driven programs focus on the swath of jobs that require a high school diploma but not necessarily a university degree. </p><h2>A change in direction</h2><p>These jobs, which can range from computer specialist to healthcare technician, are what Chauncey Lennon, senior program director of <a href=\"http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Corporate-Responsibility/new-skills-at-work.htm\">JP Morgan Chase's New Skills at Work</a> initiative, calls the \"middle skills\" jobs. \"That's where much of the challenge lies,\" he said.</p><p>The $250m program, launched in December, aims to increase the number of skilled workers to meet employers' needs in a number of industries, such as healthcare and manufacturing. The five-year initiative, which also rolled out in Europe earlier this month, stemmed from JP Morgan's \"daily\" conversations with businesses about the challenges they faced in finding employees that could do the job.<br /> <br />\"What was difficult, and what was getting in the way, was their inability to find skilled workers,\" said Lennon. </p><p>JP Morgan is currently collecting data and funding reports in nine cities, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco, to better understand which skills are in short supply and where more training is needed. Once that process is completed, the company will identify which education providers, such as community colleges and technical training programs, to invest in. JP Morgan already has a number of national partners, like <a href=\"http://www.jff.org/\">Jobs for the Future</a>, which helps equip low-income people with the skills to get better paying jobs.</p><h2>Moving in to schools</h2><p>Some companies are taking a more targeted approach by creating entire high schools with the aim of priming students as young as 14 for a career in a Stem field.</p><p>IBM led the way with its <a href=\"http://www.ptechnyc.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1\">Pathways in Technology Early College High Schools</a> (P-Tech), in what could be described as a radical new take on secondary education. The initiative is a network of public high schools, which run from the ninth to 14th grades and place emphasis on a technology-based curriculum. </p><p>IBM launched its first school in 2011 in collaboration with the New York City Department of Education and City University of New York. In 2012, the company helped open another school in Chicago. And last year, New York State announced that it plans to open a further 16 such schools with the help of IBM.</p><p>SAP has followed IBM's lead, and will open the doors to its Business Technology Early College High School (B-Tech) in Queens, New York in August. Like IBM's model, the school will run from the ninth to 14th grades. Students will take four years of high school level courses, followed by two years of community college level courses. The school, which will welcome just over 100 ninth graders in the fall, was created in partnership with the State of New York and Queensborough Community College. </p><h2>A win-win situation</h2><p>For SAP, it's about targeting people at a young age and educating them about job opportunities they may never have known about. </p><p>\"Our goal was to create a hands-on approach, so students can get a real world inside view,\" said Jackie Montesino Suarez, SAP's head of corporate responsibility for North America. </p><p>It's a win-win situation for SAP and the students, said Suarez. A lot of the young people come from underprivileged communities, so the program gives them an opportunity they might never have had. On the other hand, the school helps SAP address its need for skilled workers. </p><p>But a 14-year-old can't be expected to have already decided on a career path. The school therefore offers its students leeway if they decide not to enter the Stem field.   </p><p>\"B-Tech is fostering the kind of critical thinking skills and ways of problem solving that will help them in whatever they want to do,\" Suarez said. </p><p>One of the company's largest overseas programs is its Skills for Africa initiative, which offers underprivileged young people information and communication technology (ICT) training and certification. The program, launched in Kenya last year, identifies, with the help of the World Bank and local governments, what skills are lacking in the market, and offers technical training to combat this.</p><p>\"SAP and its entire ecosystem are really struggling to find the right ICT skills, that's where we come in with the programs we have,\" said Alex van der Ploeg, SAP's head of global corporate social responsibility.</p><p>In addition to training the youth, SAP also helps set them up with a job, a key factor to the success of the initiative, van der Ploeg said. </p><p>The program produced 70 graduates last year, and the aim is to graduate 2,500 youth across the continent annually.</p><h2>A step in the wrong direction?</h2><p>These public-private partnerships make financial sense. <a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/dol/budget/2013/bib.htm\">According to the US Department of Labor</a>, the government allocated $12bn towards workforce and training programs in the 2013 fiscal year. Meanwhile, the private sector spends roughly $350bn per year on boosting work skills, said Lennon. Companies therefore have a lot to offer a cash-strapped government. <br />But not everyone thinks it's a good idea to marry the two. </p><p>\"I find it appalling,\" said Deborah Meier, a renowned education activist who spent 45 years in K-12 grade public schools in Boston and East Harlem. \"Corporations should run their own apprentice training on their tab after kids complete high school.\"</p><p>But in a country still reeling from a recession, putting people with practical skills to work, whatever the means, seems like a step in the right direction. <br />\"We want a stronger economy, that's good for us and good for everybody,\" Lennon said.</p><p><em>This article was corrected to clarify that JP Morgan Chase's program had expanded to Europe \"earlier this month\" instead of aiming to launch \"later this year\".</em></p><p><em>Alison Moodie is a multimedia journalist based in Los Angeles, California.

Arguably, today's youth have good reason to be disgruntled. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/international/21576657-around-world-almost-300m-15-24-year-olds-are-not-working-what-has-caused\" title=\"\">Nearly half of the world's young</a> people are unemployed or underemployed, and more than 120 million of them are illiterate, statistics suggest.</p><p>Of course, exceptions abound. Take the visionary girls' rights campaigner Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan. Or Malawian clean tech pioneer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/oct/03/malawian-teenager-builds-wind-turbine\" title=\"\">William Kamkwamba</a>. Or even Facebook founder and gazillionaire Mark Zuckerberg. Youth apathy is by no means universal.</p><p>But there are solid grounds for believing that some teens get it a good deal tougher than others. A new <a href=\"http://www.youthindex.org/\" title=\"\">Global Youth Wellbeing Index</a> finds that young people in high-income countries fare far better than their peers in lower-income countries.</p><p>The index, which accounts for more than two-thirds (70%) of the world's young people, identifies a \"first tier\" of countries led by Australia and followed by, among others, the US, UK and Sweden. Scrabbling around the bottom, meanwhile, are low-income nations such as Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and – in last place – Nigeria.</p><p>In many ways, the final rankings present few surprises. Given their infrastructure advantages, rich countries inevitably provide their youth with better schools and so forth. The rankings hide a more nuanced story, however. \"They [top-tier countries] generally do well in most of the domains, but many of them drop in one area,\" says Nicole Goldin, development director at the Washington DC-based Center for Strategic and International Studies and lead researcher on the index.</p><p>Japan, for instance, is ranked second on economic opportunity and safety, but 23rd on civic participation (close behind the US in 20th place). A similar inconsistency is true for the lowest-ranked countries. Uganda scores worst on health and ICT, for example, yet ranks seventh and 10th for civic participation and economic opportunity, respectively.</p><p>\"It's not only about building infrastructure, but also [about] looking at how policies, systems and institutions are paying attention to serving the interests of engaging with young people,\" says Goldin.</p><p>Interesting though the findings are, is the index anything more than an academic exercise? Its architects certainly hope so. Meeting the basic needs and future career prospects of the world's 1.8 billion young people aged 10 to 24 years has become a pressing issue for governments and donor agencies over recent years. Similar concerns about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/graphic/2014/mar/19/world-map-of-youth-youth-bulge\" title=\"\">today's \"youth bulge\"</a> are now cropping up on corporate agendas too, primarily because of the drag effect that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/giving-young-people-right-skills\" title=\"\">youth skills shortages</a> are having on business growth.</p><p>\"We're trying to get companies, as well as government agencies, philanthropies and foreign aid agencies, to invest better in youth, smarter in youth and more in youth,\" says Bill Reese, chief executive of the non-profit International Youth Foundation (IYF). He describes the index, which IYF co-published, as a \"roadmap\" for investors. \"It's meant to stimulate good, smart thinking on where you would put money in country X or country Y,\" he says.</p><p>It does so by global aggregation of youth-related data across six subject areas: citizen participation, education, health, economic opportunity, information and communications technology, and security and safety. Within these are 40 different wellbeing indicators, from youth literacy to risk of trafficking. Analyse these and an accurate idea should emerge of where the strategic priorities lie for each of the 30 countries in the index, Reese explains.</p><p>The goal is to prevent investors from ploughing their money into generic health programmes, for instance. Instead, they can tailor their interventions to national needs, be it combating the problems of tobacco use, or working to prevent HIV/Aids.</p><p>\"It's all about data and about understanding what are the challenges and where you can apply the best kind of solutions,\" says Jennifer Silberman, vice president for corporate responsibility at Hilton Worldwide, which co-funded the index.</p><p>For businesses, interventions in youth wellbeing can be expected to differ from industry to industry, she adds. In the case of the hospitality sector, for instance, one-to-one communication and other soft skills are vital. Hence Hilton has invested heavily in an internal life-skills development programme, as well as industry-wide employability schemes such as the youth career initiative.</p><p>Identifying a specific area of concern without reference to the other factors impinging on a young person's wellbeing is ill advised, however. Exposure to insecurity or poor health, for example, inevitably affects a young person's capacity for civic participation or school attendance. That calls for broad solutions, ideally delivered by a range of different organisations, says IYF's Reese.</p><p>Over time, it's hoped that the index will lead to a more data-driven approach to assessing – not just designing – youth-related interventions. By demonstrating clear impacts on today's big youth-related issues, investors will begin to believe there's \"light at the end of the tunnel\". That should encourage more companies to lend a hand to problems such as youth unemployment. Who knows? It might even get a smile out of a grumpy teenager or two.</p><p><strong>The role of business in development hub is funded by Business Call To Action.

Digital finance has taken off in countries as diverse as Bangladesh, where <a href=\"http://www.bkash.com/\" title=\"\">BKash</a> [development] serves 8m registered users with payments and remittances through a network of 76,000 agents, and Pakistan, where <a href=\"http://www.easypaisa.com.pk/\" title=\"\">EasyPaisa</a>, the third largest mobile money deployment in the world, reaches 7.4m users. Chidi Okpala, director and head of Airtel Money – Africa, a mobile money service with an active base of 5m customers, <a href=\"http://eaafrica.comworldseries.com/interview-with-chidi-okpala/\" title=\"\">sees mobile financial services \"tapping in\" to other areas</a> like healthcare, agriculture, and education.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bridgeinternationalacademies.com/\" title=\"\">Bridge International Academies</a> is one company that's already ventured into the education space in Kenya. Its \"academy in a box\" relies heavily on technology to deliver quality, affordable education to children whose families live on less than $2 a day. So far, the for-profit education company has enrolled over 80,000 students in the programme, which equips teachers with a tablet to deliver standardised instruction. Parents use mobile money accounts to pay the <a href=\"http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/industry_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/industries/health+and+education/news/bridgeschools_feature\" title=\"\">approximately $6 monthly fee</a>, 40% <a href=\"http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/how-educating-africas-children-for-5-a-month-can-be-a-viable-business/21357/2/\" title=\"\">cheaper than other low-cost private schools</a> in the company's communities. Bridge makes the financially complicated process of paying for school easier for families by digitising it (94% of Bridge's families have mobile phones) and making it more affordable.</p><p>The success of M-Pesa and Bridge International illustrates that well-defined needs can be addressed with creative applications of digital finance – what CGap refers to as 'digital finance plus companies' and the Washington-based partnership has identified <a href=\"http://www.cgap.org/blog/global-landscape-digital-finance-plus\" title=\"\">more than 50 in 12 countries</a> who are taking new and exciting approaches to increasing access to clean water, energy, education, health and agriculture. Whether it's <a href=\"http://www.sarvajal.com/\" title=\"\">Sarjaval</a> building affordable access to safe drinking water in India, <a href=\"http://ecoenergyfinance.org/\" title=\"\">EcoEnergy Finance</a> providing solar energy to communities in rural Pakistan, or others, all these companies share two common characteristics: they aim to solve a fundamental access problem and they rely on digital finance to make their model work. It can be expected that some of these businesses will disrupt traditional models of providing basic services to communities at the base of the economic pyramid.</p><p>Still, enthusiasm surrounding digital finance must be tempered with caution. The industry is young, and many of these businesses have yet to prove whether or not they can scale in order to make an impact. Technology is certainly not a silver bullet to ending global poverty, and there have been obvious challenges in using it to reach the unbanked. These include, for example, low uptake of mobile offerings – as <a href=\"http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2013/10/nigeria-mobile-money-failure-blamed-on-banks/\" title=\"\">shown in Nigeria</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cgap.org/blog/understanding-customers-financial-innovation-ghana\" title=\"\">Ghana</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.cgap.org/blog/%25e2%2580%259ceasypaisa%25e2%2580%259d-journey-otc-wallets-pakistan\" title=\"\">preference for in-person transactions</a> in countries like Pakistan, the manner in which illiteracy nearly guarantees that <a href=\"http://www.cgap.org/blog/working-poorest-women-pakistan\" title=\"\">mobile banking will leave some people – especially women – behind</a>, and <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/mobile-money-plan-stumbles-start-haiti-142030133--finance.html\" title=\"\">inactive registered customers</a>. These aren't challenges with obvious solutions, but each scenario offers lessons for future projects.</p><p>What gives digital finance plus companies an advantage is that they set out to tackle problems that are central to the lives of poor people. And ultimately, these companies recognise the high-growth opportunity associated with powering their innovations with mobile financial services – <a href=\"https://gsmaintelligence.com/files/analysis/?file=130828-scaling-mobile.pdf\" title=\"\">50% of people in the developing world now have access to a mobile phone</a> even if they don't own one. As GSMA, the association of mobile phone operators, <a href=\"http://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/programmes/mobile-enabled-community-services/programme-overview\" title=\"\">has pointed out</a>, more people have access to the mobile network than energy or water. In this way, we see a potential win-win scenario: not only could digital finance be a game-changer, bringing poor people into the formal financial system, but it also stands to directly benefit companies who can take their ideas to scale and reach millions of under-served people.</p><p><em>Erin Scronce is web editor at </em><a href=\"http://www.cgap.org/\" title=\"\"><em>CGAP</em></a><em> (the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor) is a global partnership set up to advance financial inclusion.

The question is how we build the systems to deal with drought.\"</p><p>This is a question that has hung over Andrew Mude, a Kenyan economist, for the past six years. Working with the <a href=\"http://www.ilri.org\" title=\"\">International Livestock Research Institute</a> (ILRI) in the capital, Nairobi, he has brought to bear satellite technology and 30 years of data on drought and herd losses in quest of a solution.</p><p>It is impossible to monitor, accurately, the deaths of animals in herds that range across some of the most remote and inhospitable terrain on Earth, so Mude elected to concentrate on what could be measured – the vegetation. Freely available satellite images show the condition of pasture, or forage, in sufficient detail to calculate the extent of drought. His index-based livestock insurance works by protecting the vegetation, not the animals. When a drought is calculated to have exceeded a certain trigger level (15% in Wajir) the insurer pays out.</p><p>Designing a smart product is one thing, persuading people whose livelihood has remained largely unchanged for decades – if not centuries – is another. Few of the Kenyan-Somalis whose animals range across the semi-arid expanse around Wajir have any experience of insurance; only a handful of them are car or motorbike owners, or would insure their home or its contents. \"People must learn that the insurance will pay off,\" Mude said. \"We must generate trust and, as with any business, early adopters are a minority.\"</p><p>Like so many of his peers, Ahmed Mohamed, 21, a herder, has been slowly rebuilding his numbers after the last serious drought in 2011, where he lost two-thirds of his 30 goats and sheep. This year he has lost three of his animals. It was enough to persuade him to try something new. He insured five of the herd for 2,000 Kenyan shilings (£14) and has received most of it back with an indemnity of £13 after a comparatively mild failure of the rains.</p><p>One of his father's friends, Abdi Aden Bule, 65, hopes the insurance can prevent another disaster like the one he suffered during the severe drought three years ago. From being a \"wealthy man\" with 50 head of cattle, 200 sheep and goats and 10 camels, he was left with two camels, 10 cows and 30 goats.</p><p>\"The drought doesn't say when it's coming but comes,\" he said. \"But there's not any other source of wealth here, we are not farmers and we have no arable land. At least if you have animals you will not go hungry.\"</p><p>The ILRI's other major challenge has been to persuade insurance companies to partner with them. That was until he found Hassan Bashir, the chief executive of Takaful insurance, and the son of a herder from Wajir. Bashir recognised the potential immediately and was able to persuade his shareholders that it was worth the risk, despite knowing that it would take at least five years for Takaful to see a return.</p><p>While the scheme's clients are confined to one area, it means that everyone who pays in is paid out every time the drought trigger is activated. \"In one area it's weak but if we can get the whole of the Horn of Africa, if we can get all the counties, we will have critical mass.\"</p><p>This kind of ambition has attracted donors such as the UK and Australia, which have been willing to commit funds to educating herders about the benefits of insurance. Lisa Phillips, head of the <a href=\"http://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/countries/KE/\" title=\"\">UK Department for International Development in Kenya</a>, who attended the payout ceremony, believes it is worth taking a punt on schemes that have the potential to break through ingrained poverty. \"It's cheaper than providing humanitarian assistance (after a drought),\" she said. \"We're building resilience now to avoid spending loads of money later.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2014/4/1/1396362981890/Climate-change-impact-on--001.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/04/kenya-drought-insurance-scheme","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2014/apr/04/kenya-drought-insurance-scheme","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Seven ways to end preventable child deaths","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-03T15:13:30Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/apr/03/global-health-innovation-policy-advocacy","fields":{"body":"<h2>Evan Simpson, project leader, <a href=\"http://www.path.org/\" title=\"\">Path</a>, Seattle, US, @PATHtweets</h2><p><strong>Vaccination brings hope:</strong> Vaccines against rotavirus and pneumonia have proven to be highly efficacious and safe and are being rolled out globally.

Well, it's an attention-grabbing statement, ideally suited to our culture of assertive headlines, but it's probably not true. That's not to say that the rapid growth of digital will necessarily continue, either, certainly not in markets that are already saturated with handheld devices.</p><p></p><p>Why? Because the future is – as William Gibson told us quite a long time ago now – <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/books/review/distrust-that-particular-flavor-by-william-gibson-book-review.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">not evenly distributed</a>. In fact, if one thing is ubiquitous these days it would seem to be liminality. Everywhere is an in-between place. For example, even in fairly remote bits of Kenya an SMS-based information service called<a href=\"http://icow.co.ke/\" title=\"\"> iCow</a> provides farmers with veterinary advice tailored to each of their animals, including reproductive calendar reminders, feeding schedules and market information. There are fewer and fewer venues where digital technology has made no impact – and where there's a digital device, there are ebooks, at least in potential. They need not be anyone's primary method of consuming literature, but in some situations they will be the best one. Rather than circling the wagons as other media industries did (to no good outcome, it has to be acknowleged) publishers need to learn the more recent lessons from music and film and consider, for example, providing digital copies as standard with hardback editions.</p><p></p><p>Digital will continue to grow for a while at least, and continue to exist, because it is becoming part of the world we inhabit at a level below our notice, no more remarkable than roads or supermarkets. Ebooks are here to stay because digital is, and quite shortly we'll stop having this debate about paper vs ebooks because it will no longer make a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>By the same token, paper has a place in our hybrid future. Digital books are still painfully ugly and weirdly irritating to interact with. They look like copies of paper, but they can't be designed or typeset in the same way as paper, and however splendid the cover images may look on a hi-res screen, they're still images rather than physical things. To my irritation, you still can't flick through an ebook properly; you can't riffle the pages, you can't look at more than one page at once. And the advantages of having a book in digital form (easy scrolling text, proper shareability, a global text search of your library, synchronisation with audiobooks, links to television adaptations, person-to-person sales) have been ignored in favour of a weak simulacrum of paper. Better, a lot of the time, to shove a paperback in your pocket. And for when you forget, well, there's still your phone.</p><p></p><p>Until a digital book is a magical object which physically transforms from 50 Shades into the new James Smythe novel according to your whim; until you can walk through a digital library and open books at random; until the technology becomes as satisfying to the physical senses as the text is to the cognitive self, there's still a need for shiny, gorgeous, satisfying books. And when those things happen, if they do, we will have lost nothing in the transition.</p><p></p><p>A rather more important discussion than whether one half of this indivisible whole will somehow shed the other would be about this government's seeming determination to destroy our system of public libraries and dispense with Britain's access to knowledge (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/28/carol-ann-duffy-prison-book-ban-pentonville\" title=\"\">especially, it seems, in prisons</a>). It strikes me that an infantilised public is far easier to control than one that reads, that prisoners are far easier to demonise when they are cut out of national cultural conversation, and that books – consistently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/oct/08/literary-fiction-improves-empathy-study\" title=\"\">found to increase empathy in those who read them</a> – play against the mean-spirited assault on welfare and disability benefits presently under way. If the book trade has drawn one obvious flaw from the corporate culture that took it over in the 80s, it's that it tends to be a bit inward-looking, and to imagine that decisions made in and about the industry affect only the industry – hence the endless hue and cry for more aggressive copyright enforcement, and never mind that such enforcement would require a level of intrusion into the private spaces of our customers presently available only to GCHQ and the NSA.</p><p></p><p>It's time to look beyond our borders rather more, and see that we are part of the world.

Stripe’s co-founder John Collison described the company as “a programming language for payments”.

And so credit cards are a good first thing to roll out because they have such widespread penetration, but we don’t bill ourselves as a credit card processing company, we’re a payments company.</p> <p>“So whether it’s bitcoin, or whether it’s the various direct debit payment systems which are popular throughout Europe, or whether it’s M-pesa in Kenya, it totally makes sense, as more and more of our merchants are these borderless businesses selling to a global audience, to support what customers want to pay with.”</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/25/bitcoin-property-currency-irs-rules\"><strong>Bitcoin to be treated as property instead of currency by IRS</strong></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/27/1395943023740/071c3c07-cd28-4dbc-8153-8b17fe64ec9d-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/28/bitcoin-payment-service-stripe","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/mar/28/bitcoin-payment-service-stripe","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Dogecoin raises $55,000 to sponsor Nascar driver","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-27T11:33:38Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2014/mar/27/nascar-dogecoin-sponsor-josh-wise-talladega-superspeedway","fields":{"body":"<p>Fresh from its success sending Jamaica&apos;s bobsled team to the Winter Olympics, Reddit&apos;s Dogecoin community has raised 67m Doge, worth £33,000, to send a car to the iconic Talladega Superspeedway Nascar race.</p> <p>Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency which was born out of a combination of the original digital money, bitcoin, and the Doge meme, which features photos of a baffled yet placid Shiba Inu with broken English written in multicoloured Comic Sans over the top.<br /></p> <p>The sponsorship fundraiser began when members of Reddit&apos;s Nascar community identified up-and-coming driver Josh Wise as an underdog in need of financial support.</p> <p>The group appealed to the Dogecoin community for help, and after an eight-day fundraising drive, 1,200 donations averaging $41 were enough to sponsor his car, covering it in images of dogecoin and the Reddit alien.

About a third of the global population has no access to a toilet, and roughly the same number of people have to openly defecate. Even a toilet is no assurance of hygiene – thousands of children die from sanitation-related diseases, including diarrhoea, every day, mainly caused by lack of access to clean water.</p><p>International organisations like <a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org/uk/\" title=\"\">WaterAid</a>  have been effective in developing strategies to address sanitation, like creating local partnerships. Elsewhere, multinational companies have built communal wells and water pumps, but their enthusiasm and philanthropic desire hasn't necessarily equated to the needs of communities being met. Often where there's short-term involvement and lack of knowledge of development issues, there's no guarantee of long-term stability.</p><p>\"The overwhelming majority of households today, who have access to on-site sanitation – a toilet or latrine in their home with some means of primary treatment like a septic pit – have such access through intervention by the private sector,\" says Jemima Sy, senior water and sanitation specialist at the World Bank's <a href=\"http://www.wsp.org\" title=\"\">water and sanitation programme</a>.</p><p>\"There is no question that the development sector needs to see that this market-based model already works for the large majority, [and that it] offers an opportunity to expand the development dividends to poorer households who do not yet have such access,\" Sy says.</p><p>Previous successful projects have been led by the private sector, in collaboration with larger development organisations. But is the model – so often used – of an NGO financing a project, and a private contractor maintaining it, a sustainable one?</p><p>Last November, the Ghanaian NGO Training, Research and Network for Development was <a href=\"http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/african-water-facility-turns-waste-into-commercial-fertilizer-and-energy-while-improving-sanitation-services-for-the-urban-poor-in-ghana-12531/\" title=\"\">granted €1m</a> by <a href=\"http://www.africanwaterfacility.org/en/\" title=\"\">the African Water Facility</a> to support a waste treatment plant that will recycle fecal matter into bio-fertiliser. The project will also provide 125,000 people with sanitation services.</p><p>With the future of large-scale projects dependant on big money, there are plenty of ifs, buts and maybes. The situation is complicated by the fact that sanitation isn't a selling point for all investors. Is this where smaller NGOs could play a role, through collaborating with start-ups and entrepreneurs? Could they help communities and leverage local markets? Would this be more beneficial?</p><p>\"Businesses could be much better at delivering aspirational and affordable products,\" says Sy. She warns that as long as governments or development programmes are seen as the buyer, and not the poor, products will struggle to reach the market.</p><p>Small NGOs can help their value be realised. They are more likely to be less bureaucratic, have more experience of work on the ground and have funds granted, or donated, from supporters who share the same passion. A group of like-minded experts with knowledge of technology and development professionals, that come together to collaborate, are also more likely to understand the aesthetics that come attached with needing and having a toilet. As Sy puts it: \"How it makes them feel and how it positions them in society.\"</p><p>The Swedish-based <a href=\"http://www.peepoople.com/\" title=\"\">Peepoople</a>, who developed the Peepoo bag – \"a personal, single-use, self-sanitising, fully biodegradable toilet\" – is one example of the role small NGOs can play in the business of sanitation being understood. Peepoople <a href=\"http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-use/hardware/toilet-systems/pee-poo-bag\" title=\"\">addresses aesthetic issues</a> by allowing women to go to toilet in the decency of their own homes, so they don't have to use public sanitation services.</p><p>\"Peepoople AB, the producer of Peepoo is a limited company, but Peepoople Kenya, that imports and distributes [the bags], is a Kenyan NGO,\" explains its founder, Anders Wilhelmson. \"Business is in every part [of what we do]. Not only at Peepoople and its suppliers, but more importantly in the context and environment the toilet is used in.\"</p><p>Wilhelmson says the model \"acts as a catalyst for economic growth\" and can leverage local markets. Women become micro-entrepeneuers by selling bags on behalf of the NGO; customers receive a refund for each used bag that is returned; and the Peepoo solution collected in the bags is sold to farmers as cheap fertiliser.</p><p>While it may not totally resolve problems like privacy or handwashing – and one innovation alone can't attend all health concerns – giving locals a financial incentive, and something to buy into, means the NGO is in a better position to educate them on the importance of good hygiene and to address the taboos around sanitation.</p><p>Collaborating with the private sector is essential. A marker of how successful an NGO's involvement is, is not the amount of funding behind a product or project, but how the poor are valued as consumers (and not charity). Seeing sanitation as a business, as well as an environmental, health and social issue, can push NGOs to give water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) a higher priority in policies.</p><p><strong>Join the community of global development professionals and experts. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/global-development/\" title=\"\"><strong>Become a GDPN member</strong></a><strong> to get more stories like this direct to your inbox</strong></p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/mar/25/sanitation-access-private-sector-partnership","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/mar/25/sanitation-access-private-sector-partnership","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network"},{"webTitle":"Target the ring leaders to defeat poaching","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-23T09:52:48Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/africa-wild/2014/mar/23/target-ring-leaders-defeat-poaching","fields":{"body":"<p><b>Nairobi 19th March: </b>Four days ago I was in the bush, heartbroken, by the mutilated body of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2014/mar/16/bloody-horror-of-rhino-poaching\">rhino gunned down by poachers</a>. Now I am in the Serena Hotel in Nairobi at a crowded press conference called by Wildlife Direct, the organisation I work for. <br /></p> <p> In a strongly worded statement, Wildlife Direct&apos;s founder and chairman Richard Leakey calls on Kenya&apos;s president Uhuru Kenyatta to take decisive action in the war against the poachers. <br /></p> <p>The current situation is dire. Poachers are killing rhinos and elephants with impunity, even in heavily fortified private conservancies that were thought to be impregnable. Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2014/feb/11/kenya-african-countries-wildlife-trade-rhino-elephants\">tough new laws</a>, smugglers and poachers caught red-handed are still walking free from Kenyan courts.<br /></p> <p>Our <a href=\"http://baraza.wildlifedirect.org/2014/03/20/richard-leakey-calls-on-president-kenyatta-to-invoke-emergency-response-on-elephant-and-rhino-poaching/\">press release</a> argues that poaching and smuggling are controlled by international crime rings that pose a major threat to the economy and national security. Reports in Kenyan media reflect the sense of hopelessness that many feel in the face of this powerful enemy. </p> <p>However, though critical, the situation is not hopeless. <br /></p> <p>As head of the Kenyan Wildlife Service (KWS) in the 1980s, Richard Leakey is credited with having turned around the war on poaching in a matter of months at the time of the last major crisis. With the right leadership, he is convinced it can be done again. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUbfwuydOJI\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUbfwuydOJI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>NTV Kenya news report of Wildlife Direct press conference, Nairobi March 19th, 2014</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The story of piracy off the coast of Somalia shows how crises like these can be overcome. Piracy and poaching are similar in many ways. In both cases, the scene of the crime is sub-Saharan Africa. Both were long-standing problems that suddenly became major crises and threatened to spiral out of control. In both cases, poor people using primitive technology were able to inflict massive damage that threatened global interests.<br /></p> <p>The major difference is that piracy directly threatens western commercial interests. In response world leaders have acted decisively - and effectively. After 46 hijackings off the coast of Somalia in 2009 and 47 in 2010, there have been none at all since 12 May 2012. </p> <p>Crucially, money has been no object when it came to taking on the pirates. The current annual cost of anti-piracy security off the coast of Somalia is more than US $ 2.5 billion. This finances two key elements of the anti-piracy strategy: surveillance and protection. Around $1 billion goes on round-the-clock military naval patrols; the rest is spent by ship operators on employing privately contracted armed guards. </p> <p>Piracy has also been stopped by the simple measure of locking up the criminals. More than 1,100 Somali pirates are currently in jail in 21 countries, many of them in Kenya. <br /></p> <p>Operations are coordinated by the UN’s Contact Group on Piracy, which includes more than 85 countries as well as international agencies and private sector representatives. If you have never heard of this organisation, that’s because they’re not interested in publicity, just in getting the job done.<br /></p> <p>Four &quot;C words&quot; sum up how piracy was defeated: Cash - lots of it, a Coherent strategy, Coordination, and Commitment. How far are these four “keys to success” in place in the war on wildlife crime?<br /></p> <p>Unlike the war on piracy, until now this one has too often seemed to be all about publicity. In the run-up to the London summit on wildlife crime in February, National Geographic commented: “Everybody and his uncle in wildlife conservation is clamouring for a seat at the table.&quot; </p> <p>Hopefully this is about to change. America grabbed the headlines at the London summit in February with the launch of a new <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/11/fact-sheet-national-strategy-combating-wildlife-trafficking-commercial-b \">National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking.</a> The strategy makes some big promises about US commitment to tackle all aspects of the crisis. Secretary of State John Kerry affirmed: &quot;We must act now. The Departments of State, Justice, and Interior are leading the President&apos;s whole-of-government fight against wildlife trafficking&quot;.<br /></p> <p>There are also signs that western countries and international agencies are now prepared to commit serious money to fight wildlife crime - even though the amounts are still minuscule compared to what is spent on controlling piracy. <br /></p> <p>For example, the <a href=\"http://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/featured-commitments/partnership-save-africas-elephants\">Clinton Global Initiative recently unveiled a three-year $80 million anti-ivory poaching partnership </a>with conservation organisations that will deploy sniffer-dog teams at key ivory transit points in Africa and hire 3,000 rangers to help protect elephants at 50 sites.<br /></p> <p>These are encouraging signs of more cash, improved coordination, and greater commitment. But what is still missing is a coherent strategy that recognizes and responds to the truth that Richard Leakey spelled out forcefully at our press conference: the traffickers are getting away with it because in many countries authorities are not prepared to take on the small numbers of gang leaders who control the operations. <br /></p> <p>The best equipped and trained rangers, and the most stringent laws, will remain impotent as long as the gang leaders are at liberty to use threats and bribery to neutralise them.<br /></p> <p>After the London summit, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague commented: &quot;this is not just about governments, this is about the public understanding that the ivory trade involves the death of elephants on a great scale”. This sounds as if the UK government is trying to evade responsibility. <br /></p> <p>The truth is, only states have the resources needed to defeat the organised crime networks controlling the $10 billion trade in illegal wildlife products. People across the world already understand the problem and what is at stake. We are waiting for our governments to take decisive action to target the gang leaders, and root out the high-level corruption that allows them to operate with impunity. <br /></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/23/1395565960589/7886d3d7-12e8-40c3-a216-f94d60a17260-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/africa-wild/2014/mar/23/target-ring-leaders-defeat-poaching","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/africa-wild/2014/mar/23/target-ring-leaders-defeat-poaching","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Dr Christian Jessen: 'The public's thirst for gory medical things is insatiable'","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-21T13:25:06Z","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","id":"tv-and-radio/2014/mar/21/dr-christian-jessen-interview","fields":{"body":"<p>It is towards the end of my hour with television's Dr Christian Jessen that I finally raise the issue of piles, but from the unflustered, slightly ironic look on his face, you get the sense that barely a&nbsp;day goes by when haemorrhoids are not mentioned. As his fellow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jul/17/tv-obsession-embarrassing-disease\" title=\"\">Embarrassing Bodies</a> host Dr Pixie McKenna told the Cambridge News recently: \"I don't know why people are obsessed with piles, but one of the most common things that gets shouted at us is: 'Do you want to come and look at my piles?' Tis&nbsp;a difficult cross to bear, to be sure.\"</p><p>I mention piles to Dr Christian not because – I hasten to add – they in any way blight my own existence, but because, like much of the UK's TV viewing public, Dr Christian has, over the last seven years, increased my acquaintance with them immeasurably. Thanks to his series Embarrassing Bodies, which returns next month, my&nbsp;mother and I once were gifted with a&nbsp;high-definition close-up of a stranger's anus while we were trying to eat our tea, and I'm sure we weren't the only ones.</p><p>Dr Christian, who meets me at a cafe near the Thames on a sunny Saturday, laughs when I tell him this. \"The reason you see it so much on Embarrassing Bodies is because we get it so much,\" he&nbsp;says. It is, apparently, a problem that affects half the population, but one has to wonder whether or not the British viewing public might be becoming tired of it. Dr Christian thinks not: \"When we first filmed it, back when it was called Embarrassing Illnesses and it was a half-hour show, we were filming it in Birmingham, and it was verrucas, piles, eczema. Those everyday GP cases that you see 10 cases of a day, day in, day out, for the rest of your life. I&nbsp;remember thinking, 'This is really dull, this is never&nbsp;going to make a TV show, this is going to be dead in the water after they run the first series.' I'm delighted to say that I've never been more wrong – that the public thirst for medical things, particularly the more gory medical things, is insatiable.\"</p><p>Dr Christian is enormously proud of Embarrassing Bodies, a format that was initially pitched to him as a fly-on-the-wall documentary involving GPs. Not only did it help transform him into the most recognisable doctor in the country, but its format has been replicated in Australia and the Netherlands. It has two Baftas to its name, both of which honoured its website, which, as well as teaching users to perform simple health checks, also features penis and breast galleries that aim to show people the normal anatomical variations that occur.</p><p>Before Embarrassing Bodies, Jessen was a sexual health specialist who would make the odd TV appearance to&nbsp;comment on news stories, mainly due&nbsp;to his senior consultant's media-shyness. He did his medical training at&nbsp;UCL, and shared a halls-of-residence corridor with Coldplay, whom he says used to \"annoy the crap out of us\" by playing their guitars late into the night. He then specialised in sexual health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, with his focus on HIV&nbsp;and malaria leading him to stints in&nbsp;Kenya and Uganda. He now not only fronts Embarrassing Bodies and its spinoffs, but also the equally popular Supersize vs Superskinny. He has also just produced a documentary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/19/undercover-doctor-cure-me-im-gay-tv-review\" title=\"\">Undercover Doctor: Cure Me, I'm Gay</a>, during which he investigates and undergoes a number of so-called \"gay cures\", which you may have caught last week (<a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/undercover-doctor-cure-me-im-gay\" title=\"\">it's available on catch-up TV</a>). All this he juggles with magazine columns, his Harley Street clinic, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoctorChristian\" title=\"\">a&nbsp;voracious Twitter audience</a> who rely on him to answer (and always in capitals) such varied questions as \"can HPV get in your eye and lead to cancer?\" (\"NOT THAT WE KNOW OF, NO\") to \"will sticking my penis up the hoover (for pleasure) cause any damage to my genetils [sic]?\" (\"QUITE PROBABLY\").</p><p>Jessen is seriously buff. Not only is he buff, and bronzed to boot, but he is also charming. Brought up in Hammersmith, west London, he was sent away to school at seven, and has talked of feeling lonely in the first few years, and of being teased, later, for preferring the company of girls to that of boys. His mother is a linguist and his father a physicist. In Cure Me, I'm Gay there is a&nbsp;particularly touching scene in which, having been told by various churchgoing Americans that homosexuality is a&nbsp;product of childhood sexual abuse or&nbsp;trauma, he asks for his father's thoughts. \"I was terribly proud of him after filming that. It was unprompted, unscripted\", he says. \"I wanted to show&nbsp;a dad chatting to his gay son and being completely unfazed by the fact that his&nbsp;son is gay and, in fact, saying the right things like, 'No, we love you all&nbsp;the same', and it was very moving. I&nbsp;was like, no, I'm not going to cry at&nbsp;this&nbsp;point, I'm not going to cry.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432666202'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395403828802/Dr-Christian-Jessens-Chan-009.jpg' alt='Dr Christian Jessen's Channel 4 film Cure me I'm Gay' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Dr Christian Jessen's Channel 4 film Cure Me I'm Gay</figcaption></figure><p>This was the first film that gave him full editorial control, and there's no doubt that, for a gay man, the process of making it was extremely upsetting for him – the aversion therapy he undergoes, during which he is made to vomit while looking at homoerotic images, is&nbsp;particularly difficult to watch. \"I&nbsp;suddenly went from being how you usually see me on telly, which is as a&nbsp;fairly calm, in-control doctor not flustered by anything, to, I think, being an abused patient\", he says. \"It's not particularly nice being made to vomit, especially not being made to vomit like that. I was upset for all the people who had to go through this, sometimes enforced, sometimes voluntarily, because they were so miserable and life&nbsp;was so difficult.\" He tails off, looking thoughtful. \"I suspect that, with laws being brought in in countries like Russia and Uganda, they've just taken this massive step back into the dark ages. These sorts of treatments will again start&nbsp;to rear their heads.\"</p><p>When it aired, the documentary trended online worldwide, though not without controversy. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/10705094/Undercover-Doctor-Cure-Me-Im-Gay-Channel-4-review.html\" title=\"\">The Daily Telegraph wrote</a> than Jessen's \"staunch and unflinching homosexuality made him, for these purposes, a bad journalist\". Jessen acknowledges this factor. If Cure Me, I'm Gay was biased, he&nbsp;tells me, it's biased in the sense that&nbsp;\"I don't want to not be gay – I'm&nbsp;perfectly happy with how I am.\" Despite&nbsp;being happy and in a long-term relationship, he has had struggles. In the&nbsp;past he's been open about his body dysmorphia, which he links to his own gym-going (it has been reported that he exercises for an hour and a half each day, seven days a week) and that of many young gay men. \"Bodybuilding is much misunderstood. I think it comes across as just vanity – worrying about your pecs is just a 'gay vanity thing' – but it's&nbsp;not. It's a far deeper underlying problem than that, and in the case of severe body dysmorphia, it can lead to&nbsp;serious self-harm, in a way.</p><p>\"I struggled with it for years, and it's&nbsp;linked in to self-esteem, and yes, you&nbsp;do&nbsp;see it very commonly with young gay&nbsp;men. It's sometimes from being teased at school, or being a bit weedy, or&nbsp;a not-being-picked-for-the-team-type issue, but much, much more than that – I'm grossly oversimplifying that\", he says. Jessen does this in conversation – he regularly adds caveats to ensure that his point is made as clearly as possible. \"All that plays a part in undermining your confidence in yourself, and so how do you tackle that? You develop a false sense of self-image. The way I describe body dysmorphia is that when you look in the mirror, what you see is not really what you are. That's the bottom line of it. With me, when it was really bad, I'd look in the mirror and see the skinny teenager, the beanpole I&nbsp;always was, not the 95kg guy that I had turned myself into. And you can see how that can be very destructive and can turn into steroid abuse, sunbeds, even as far as cosmetic&nbsp;surgery.\"</p><p>Jessen links body dysmorphia to the rise in male anorexia. \"The media does have a role to play – images do influence young men in the same way that they influence young women. You can't help but look on the front of some magazine and see a&nbsp;buffed-up film star and feel inadequate,\" he tells me. This, in part, is&nbsp;why he is so proud of Embarrassing Bodies. A doctor came up to him recently at London's Euston station and made a point about the show that he hadn't previously considered, which is that \"you actually show normal bodies on TV\". She had a point: elsewhere, there's nary a bingo wing or a&nbsp;spotty back to be seen, but the bodies on Embarrassing Bodies are those that \"us&nbsp;lot (doctors) see every day, in all the inglorious ways in which bodies come, and you know, they're not airbrushed perfection, they're not always perfectly formed, or running correctly. It's so important to actually see normal people&nbsp;with normal bodies.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-432666203'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/21/1395403699151/Dr-Priya-Manickavasagar-D-009.jpg' alt='Dr Priya Manickavasagar, Dr Christian Jessen and Dr Pixie McKenna on Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Dr Priya Manickavasagar, Dr Christian Jessen and Dr Pixie McKenna on Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies</figcaption></figure><p>Jessen's other hit show, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/supersize-vs-superskinny\" title=\"\">Supersize vs Superskinny</a>, a programme in which an underweight person and an overweight person swap diets, has faced its fair share of controversy, most notably in 2012 when <a href=\"http://www.b-eat.co.uk/\" title=\"\">eating disorders charity B-eat</a> accused it of \"triggering\" eating disorder sufferers. The reaction to his programmes from the medical profession has been mixed. Half of them, like the \"lady doctor\" at Euston (I don't correct his use of the term; I'm too dazzled) love Embarrassing Bodies, and say it has made their jobs easier as patients are more forthcoming; the other half have not been so kind. \"We get words like 'exploitative', 'freakshow' – they make me so angry, these words. They say, 'You're selling yourself out', 'Go and get&nbsp;a proper job', 'Stop, you're an embarrassment to the medical profession'. You get the full range of things.</p><p>\"The medical profession is quite slow to keep up with modern technology. We're a very – I&nbsp;want to say stuffy, I'm going to say stuffy – we're a very stuffy profession,\" he says, emphatically. He feels very strongly that his use of Twitter – and Skype, which he now uses in his clinic – is the direction in which things are moving. \"It's nice to interact. It's what we should be doing. I believe in it so strongly because of preventative medicine. You don't let them get ill and then treat them … we just can't afford it within the NHS. What&nbsp;we can afford to do is stop people getting ill in the first place, and one of the best ways of doing that is&nbsp;through social media, through advertising,&nbsp;through television, and&nbsp;through education.</p><p>\"The NHS\", says Jessen, is \"a bit like religion. It's the ultimate sacred cow that no one is allowed to criticise or touch, and as soon as anyone tries to make any changes, they become a traitor. Any poor politician who just tries … \" He changes track, perhaps aware that he is straying into difficult territory. \"It's not going to endure for ever, it can't possibly. It is a fantastic concept, but it has to keep evolving as healthcare keeps evolving, and it hasn't evolved at the same pace.\"</p><p>This doesn't, he hastens to add, mean selling it off to private companies. \"I&nbsp;don't know what the answer is. But I&nbsp;think we have to be more prepared to&nbsp;make quite deep&nbsp;changes.\"</p><p>Despite what Twitter may imply, Jessen doesn't have all the answers (though he can tell you what love is: \"A&nbsp;TRICK OF YOUR GENES\"). But it's clear he cares enormously about his patients – it was a gay patient in distress who sparked the idea for his recent documentary. Dr Christian is also passionate and articulate about many things, including supplements and vitamins, which he denounces, mid-rant, as \"charlatanism\". </p><p>I could listen to him put the world to rights all afternoon, and, while he may not be able to solve the healthcare crisis, dismissing him as nothing more than a&nbsp;TV doctor hardly does him justice. Nor is it fair to reduce his body of work down to piles. As he himself admits: \"I know everybody watches Embarassing Bodies and giggles at the willies and giggles at the boobs. That's fine, that's OK. Because at the end of that hour of giggling you will have learned something. Or you may be going, 'Oh my God, I've got that. I might not be going to tell all my friends, but I'm going to go and see my GP.'

The discussion revealed that approaches are evolving quickly. While services for survivors, like comprehensive post-rape care, are still lacking, the innovations we're seeing are focused on prevention efforts. Here are six of the best strategies suggested by the Twitterverse:</p><h2>Engage communities holistically, not issue by issue</h2><p>In the past, we've struggled with addressing violence when programmes only targeted potential victims of violence or focused too narrowly on single issues. Leading organisations today realise the importance of engaging whole communities in this work and focus on addressing the root causes of violence. Community needs, perspectives and voices are the starting point and central to the work.</p><p>Senegal-based NGO Tostan's <a href=\"http://tostan.org/community-empowerment-program\" title=\"\">community empowerment programmes</a> spread awareness of human rights issues, including female genital mutilation, through social networks. In addition, Raising Voices produces <a href=\"http://raisingvoices.org/sasa/\" title=\"\">activist kits</a> to encourage communities to re-think and reshape social norms that underpin the use of violence.</p><h2>Create mentorship programmes for girls in and out of school</h2><p>Mentorship programmes offered by organisations like the <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/channels/lwala/77705933\" title=\"\">Lwala Community Alliance in Kenya</a> not only help keep girls in school and encourage out of school girls to re-enroll, but they also empower girls to be self-advocates and provide safe spaces for girls to learn about issues such as reproductive health and gender-based violence.</p><h2>Build healthy relationships</h2><p>Several organisations are also helping girls to <a href=\"http://startstrong.futureswithoutviolence.org/\" title=\"\">build healthy relationships</a> that are rooted in power sharing. Additionally, boys are gaining the skills needed to sustain more equal relationships. Futures Without Violence <a href=\"http://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/content/features/detail/811\" title=\"\">equips athletic coaches</a> with strategies to help build attitudes and behaviours among young male athletes that prevent relationship abuse.</p><h2>Bring the men along</h2><p>Increasing outreach to men and boys is now widely recognised as a critical component of any work to reduce violence and increase gender equality. New approaches that seem promising include parenting programmes that encourage men to be more engaged caregivers, such as <a href=\"http://men-care.org/MenCare-Films/MenCare002D-Join-the-Movement.aspx\" title=\"\">MenCare's fatherhood campaign</a>.</p><h2>Use technology to break the silence</h2><p>Current communications technology - from Twitter to <a href=\"http://xchange.futureswithoutviolence.org/library\" title=\"\">online media libraries</a> - allows us to share ideas and connect via campaigns such as <a href=\"http://www.onebillionrising.org/\" title=\"\">One Billion Rising</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/endviolence/\" title=\"\">Unicef's End Violence</a>. Beyond Borders stages <a href=\"http://beyondborders.typepad.com/beyond_borders/2013/02/sasa-radio-dramas.html\" title=\"\">community-led radio dramas</a> and Because I am a Girl creates <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjHYlmjjLoM&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">empowering dance videos on YouTube</a>. Adolescents in Haiti are <a href=\"http://www.voicesofyouth.org/en/posts/adolescents-use-smartphones-to-map-and-change-their-community\" title=\"\">using smart phones to map HIV issues</a>. Sharing <a href=\"http://www.issuu.com/safemag\" title=\"\">survivors' stories</a> also helps influence policy and legislation, and demonstrates the possibilities of overcoming hardship and ending pervasive silence.</p><h2>Collaborate</h2><p>There is a need for strong partnerships between organisations and sectors to address the complexities of violence against girls, which (as a public-private partnership) Together for Girls strives to achieve. Bringing our different strengths together and sharing the lessons we're learning will help us to end the global pandemic of violence against women and children.</p><p>While not all of the innovations mentioned have been fully evaluated, we are excited and hopeful about the work being piloted and developed. Of course, to keep innovating, we must continue to listen to<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79u1OXgh3-E&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=UUy5JAzA0sz2AgqJqpwsx5WQ\" title=\"\"> the voices of women and children</a> and use data and research to understand what is worth expanding or refining, especially as we try to reach larger numbers of people.</p><p><em>Joya Taft-Dick and Sandie Taylor are at </em><a href=\"http://www.togetherforgirls.org\" title=\"\"><em>Together for Girls</em></a><em>.

Youth from across the world weigh in","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-28T07:00:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/marketing-advertising-social-media-allowed-youth","fields":{"body":"<p>Marketing and advertising directed towards children and youth is not a new phenomenon but increasing attention from parents, regulators, business and civil society around ethical debates have recently taken flight. Many children regularly have unsupervised access to numerous forms of media, particularly online. Advertising is everywhere: on TV, radio, the internet, and now more than ever, on our social media networks. There are   growing concerns about the effects of this marketing on children's physical and mental health as well as on behavior and self-esteem.</p><p>Marketing and advertising to children often gets a bad reputation. But, does it have to?</p><p>To help shed light on this, in collaboration with the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.voicesofyouth.org/\" title=\"\">UNICEF Voices of Youth platform</a> we asked young people to respond to the following question: Should marketing and advertising to children via social media be allowed? Why?</p><p>You will find below a selection of quotes from youth across the world.</p><h2>Herman, 23, Kenya</h2><p>\"Of course it should. Why not? If it is meant for the children, then they should know it exists. By exposing children and youth to the world of advertising, you are ensuring that they learn the skill of choice. However, regulation should be highly advocated for. Children are very vulnerable, as much as you are giving them the power of choice, ensure that the market does not abuse this.\"</p><h2>Mel, 22, South Africa</h2><p>\"No, they aren't experienced enough to form good judgement or views that are not biased...Younger and even older kids are easily influenced. We can advise them better, but not dictate.\"</p><h2>Živilė, Lithuania, 17</h2><p>\"I think it shouldn't be banned first of all because it's simply impossible in the 21st century when media is very powerful. Also children have to learn to think about what's wrong and what's right.\"</p><h2>Hewane, Ethopian living in Morocco, 23</h2><p>\"Of course! We live in a world where advertising is ubiquitous in everyday life. In fact social media is the best way to expose youth to products meant for them because it's the space where they are connected.\"</p><h2>Fatoumata, Guinean living in Morocco, 23</h2><p>\"I don't see a problem with products being advertised through social media. The only types of ads that should be prohibited are those of a sexual nature or which are questionable morally. They could affect the psychological well-being of children. Social media is the main means of communication today.\"</p><h2>Patrick, Uganda, 21</h2><p>\"Marketing and advertising on social media is not a bad idea. Their impact on children is likely to depend on the content and exposure. We should also consider the fact that some adverts are actually useful to children and have a positive impact on their lives in the long run. Evidence, especially from areas such as tobacco control, nutrition and HIV/AIDS suggests that marketing and advertising in social media can change health behaviours. It starts with me and you taking a bold step in guiding the children on positive use of social media and filtering what kind of adverts they are exposed to on social media. This is not easy but collectively it's very possible.\"</p><h2>Francisca, 19, United Kingdom</h2><p>\"Over the past few decades we have seen a huge development in technology thus leading to social media. This is a good thing (like Voices of Youth ^_^) but at what point do advertisers consider the morality of marketing and targeting children and youth? Social media is such a new tool. Attempting to regulate advertising I believe will always be an issue.\"</p><h2>Aulia, Indonesia, 20</h2><p>\"I decide to say \"NO\" for the marketing of ads to children. Marketing and ads should not be allowed for children. As we know they are not the customers, because the children don't have money or buy the products they want. We have discussed (on twitter) about the guidelines or rules for the company and I really agree about it. It would be the regulation of the company in creating the ads. But I am really sure it would be better if the government or some organizations conduct sensitization training for the companies to increase the awareness and make them realize that affecting children and making them into consumers is not a good thing. Sensitization for the parents is also an important thing.\"</p><p><em>Copy on this page is provided by UNICEF, supporter of the </em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/child-rights-business\" title=\"\"><em>children: the next business agenda hub</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/27/1393522532881/Girl-on-phone-with-social-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/marketing-advertising-social-media-allowed-youth","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/marketing-advertising-social-media-allowed-youth","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"Man falls just short in patriot game to be 100% French","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-27T15:06:17Z","sectionId":"world","id":"world/2014/feb/27/benjamin-carle-100-percent-french-made-in-france","fields":{"body":"<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-430891280\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/02/27/140227MadeInFrance-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/02/27/140227MadeInFrance_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/02/27/140227MadeInFrance_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/02/27//140227MadeInFrance.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/27/140227MadeInFrance/140227MadeInFrance.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>Benjamin Carle is 96.9% made in France, right down to his underpants and socks.

As always, the BBC Careers site lists the kind of jobs \"people who applied for this job also applied for\", compellingly revealing that a would-be \"assistive technology test specialist\" and a \"server and storage engineer\" applicant were among the figures who also put themselves forward as long-shot contenders to run two TV channels.</p><p>✒ Adam Barker looks the one to beat, as Danny Cohen has made him acting controller of BBC2 and BBC4, presumably anticipating a lengthy selection process. But this could be no more enviable than having got the penultimate stone on the button in curling.  Cohen and Tony Hall won't be keen to replace a woman with a man, and a number of female execs are seen as potential Eve Muirheads – Alison Kirkham, Emma Swain and Emma Willis (not the Celebrity Big Brother one) among them. Disappointingly, though, bookies have so far refused to accept bets on \"someone called Emma\".</p><p>✒ The game of musical chairs at the BBC's crowded London HQ has started again. News supremo James Harding, his No 2 Fran Unsworth and rookie newsgathering chief Jonathan Munro are moving from their second floor offices to be closer to the troops. Not to the actual newsroom pit visible on-screen, oh no, just the ground floor of New Broadcasting House – which will entail further building activity (readers with good memories may recall they only moved into their existing offices after work had been done) and relocating staff currently occupying that area. Meanwhile Lord Hall, and possibly his right-hand-woman Anne Bulford, are said to be thinking of moving to nearby Old Broadcasting House, which doesn't sound like a vote of confidence in shiny NBH.

Other Staggers advertising now seems similarly more suited to the world of NS associate editor Jemima Khan than the kind of typical readers interviewed in its Subscriber of the Week slot, with ads for royal hatters Lock &amp; Co (panama hats: £225), golfing and skiing holidays, £4,000 a head safaris in Kenya, and Aberdeen Asset Management.

This is especially true where the transit system has many \"informal\" aspects. In such cases – and there are many across Africa, Asia and Latin America – even basic information is unavailable. Navigating and understanding these public transport systems as a passenger, a planner or advocate is often bewildering.</p><p>A case in point is Nairobi. The vast majority of people in the Kenyan capital – around 3.5 million – rely mainly on \"matatus\" to get around. Matatus are public service vehicles of varied size, usually painted in bright colours and humourous slogans, operated by many private and poorly regulated businesses. In the 1990s, the Kenyan government allowed the formal bus system to collapse; since then, it has largely failed to plan for its public transit system – all the while collecting fees from licences and fines from matatus.</p><p>Matatu operators and owners – in interaction with their passengers – are Nairobi's invisible public transit planners. Nairobians have a complex relationship with this homegrown system: it elicits admiration – whole websites are devoted to <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/pin/158470480609759148/\" title=\"\">matatu art</a> and culture – but also anger, with frequent editorials in the papers about the \"matatu menace\". Nearly everyone agrees that it needs to be better regulated and planned. The question is how.</p><p>The government, meanwhile, is planning many largescale urban transport projects – but how they will impact on the matatu system, and mesh with it, is unclear. It is not uncommon for such projects to cater to private cars and completely ignore the city's existing public transit system, which patently needs to become more visible in the city's planning process and public dialogue. But how, when even the most basic information about the matatu system is missing?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430132582'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/18/1392731147691/Cities-matatu-3-mist-011.jpg' alt='Cities: matatu 3, mist' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A typically colourful matatu named Mist on the streets of Nairobi – many take names from rappers, footballers, songs, films or even sayings. Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP</figcaption></figure><p>In 2011, I started chatting about this problem in Nairobi with Adam White from <a href=\"http://www.groupshot.org/about/\" title=\"\">Groupshot</a>, a small, Boston-based design firm specialising in informality. Adam spends a lot of time in the vibrant tech world of Nairobi and, like me, was fascinated with matatus. He noticed that his Kenyan colleagues were striving to create maps, gathering the basic data to make a trip planner and other tools to help navigate the matatu system. We realised that with the low-cost technology of mobile phones, ubiquitous in Nairobi, it is possible to gather basic transit data such as routes and stops.</p><p>With Peter Waiganjo and Dan Orwa of the University of Nairobi's <a href=\"http://www.c4dlab.ac.ke\" title=\"\">C4D lab</a> at the school of computing and informatics, and Sarah Williams of <a href=\"http://www.civicdatadesignlab.org\" title=\"\">MIT's civic data design lab</a>, plus support from the Rockefeller Foundation, our <a href=\"http://www.digitalmatatus.com/\" title=\"\">newly established \"digital matatu\" team</a> began mapping out the system using mobiles and GPS units. A team of brilliant and dedicated Kenyan students sought out every route they could find in the city – 130 of them, it turned out (no one was sure before). They carefully geo-located stops and collected key information such as whether a stop was sanctioned by the city or not.</p><p>Gangs run some routes and theft is a common problem, so we lost a few phones, but thankfully no one was hurt. Some stops are regular but others are not. Routes can get diverted – in response to passenger needs, congestion, construction or the presence of the traffic police. Over time, the digital matatu team created the first comprehensive database of the matatu system – in a standard format (general transit feed specification, or GTFS) that allows easy mapping of data on to Open Street Map or Google Maps, and access to open-source software like Open Trip Planner.</p><p>A growing global community of creative urban thinkers and \"civic hackers\" are helping cities to create and/or open up their transit data. This enables innovation that produces useful apps for passengers and tools for planners, and allows for more public participation including in data creation through crowdsourcing. As we <a href=\"http://www.gtfsfortherestofus.net\" title=\"\">swapped experiences with similar projects</a> focusing on Manila, Mexico City and Dhaka, we began to see ourselves as part of a bigger project, ensuring that cities which rely on informal transport systems are part of the technological revolution that is brewing around information and transit.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-430132583'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/18/1392729566235/Cities-matatus-1-stations-011.jpg' alt='Cities: matatus 1, stations' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A map of matatu stations in Nairobi generated by the digital matatu team</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout, we strategised on how to involve potential users of our data. We held workshops with a government thinktank and held a hackathon at the C4D lab to encourage more data users. Young software developers came up with creative ideas, from an app that warns you of unsafe areas (blackspots are notorious in Kenya, with its high traffic accident rates) to a \"rave app\" that allows you to find other people at night and alert a matatu to pick you up at a specific location.</p><p>A database is exciting for software developers but for the public, it is a map that draws attention. Sarah Williams and Wenfei Xu at MIT converted the data into an elegant map that allows you to see all the routes and main stops – the system as a whole, with its starfish tentacles and crowded core.</p><p>At the map's launch in Nairobi on 28 January, some exclaimed with pride that it looked like a London or New York map. Others were already asking government officials how they planned to improve transit. The city county of Nairobi officially adopted the map. The press covered it extensively, along with discussions on public transit policy.</p><p>To us the data and map are not ends in themselves; they should be powerful ways to spur advocacy and support better-informed public dialogue and planning. This is a necessary step towards better public transit, which is critical to building better cities.</p><p><em>Jacqueline M Klopp is an associate research scholar at the </em><a href=\"http://www.csud.ei.columbia.edu\" title=\"\"><em>centre for sustainable urban development</em></a><em> at Columbia University, New York, and a member of the digital matatu team</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/18/1392731140248/Cities-matatu-3-mist-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/feb/19/cities-motion-how-we-mapped-matatus-nairobi","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2014/feb/19/cities-motion-how-we-mapped-matatus-nairobi","sectionName":"Cities"},{"webTitle":"Not just a numbers game: improving global literacy","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-17T16:46:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/feb/17/improving-global-literacy-education","fields":{"body":"<p>There is no debate around the relevance of education to development. \"The interconnected dividends that result from investments in equitable quality education are immeasurable,\" <a href=\"http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/18290406tstisuesedcult.pdf\" title=\"\">said a recent UN brief</a>, \"generating greater economic returns and growth for individuals and societies, creating a lasting impact on public health, decent work and gender equality, and leading to safer and more resilient and stable societies.\"</p><p>At first glance, progress towards millenium development goal two - achieving universal primary education - is on track. <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/education.shtml\" title=\"\">Enrollment in primary schools in developing countries reached 90% in 2010</a>, but with further scrutiny we see that being enrolled in school doesn't necessarily mean that children are learning. <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/efareport/reports/2013\" title=\"\">Unesco's annual in-depth Education for All global monitoring report</a>, released last month, showed that despite efforts from numerous international organisations, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jan/29/illiteracy-education-young-people-developing-countries\" title=\"\">one in four young people in developing countries are unable to read a sentence</a>.</p><p>Is this failure to educate due to lack of effort or lack of skill?

Biotech crop land area has grown every year since commercial planting began in 1996, the report says.</p><p>\"Millions of small and larger farmers in both industrial and developing countries have adopted this technology for one main reason: It deliver benefits,\" says <a href=\"http://www.saworldview.com/wv/profiles/clive-james/\" title=\"\">Clive James</a>, the author of the report and ISAAA's founder and chairman emeritus.</p><p>While the report does not attempt to document the benefits of biotech crops, James says they reduce pesticide use, which saves farmers money, and increase productivity. More than 90% (16.5 million) of farmers planting biotech crops are small and resource-poor, the report says.</p><p>While the US remains by far the world leader in biotech crops, more than half of the biotech crop land area is now cultivated by farmers in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Most grow cotton. Typically, the adoption cycle for biotech crops moves from fibre (cotton) to feed (soybeans and corn that are fed to livestock) and only then to food.</p><p>That said, biotech crops remain concentrated in five big countries – the US, Brazil, Argentina, India and Canada – which together account for nearly 90% of the world's biotech acreage. So, despite the rapid adoption of biotech crops, the report shows that the most <a href=\"http://www.monsanto.com/improvingagriculture/Pages/growing-populations-growing-challenges.aspx\" title=\"\">common argument</a> on their behalf, advanced by companies such as Monsanto – that they will be needed to feed a growing and hungry planet – remains unproven, to say the least.</p><p>Nearly all of the GM crops being cultivated are herbicide-tolerant or pesticide-tolerant, which \"means that existing GMOs remain essentially an appendage of the pesticide industry, which has dominated the technology from the start,\" as <a href=\"http://grist.org/food/crop-flops-gmos-lead-ag-down-the-wrong-path/\" title=\"\">Tom Philpott put it recently in Grist</a>.</p><p>James says that will soon change, noting that the first planting of drought-tolerant crops took place last year. In the US, about 2,000 farmers in the corn belt planted about 50,000 hectares of the first <a href=\"http://news.monsanto.com/press-release/monsanto-basf-scientists-disclose-discovery-gene-conferring-drought-tolerance-corn-pla\" title=\"\">biotech drought-tolerant corn</a>, developed by Monsanto and BASF. Five African countries have joined a partnership called <a href=\"http://wema.aatf-africa.org/\" title=\"\">Water Efficient Maize for Africa</a> that aims to develop drought-tolerant and insect-protected maize, with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Howard G Buffett Foundation, and USAID. Maize is the most widely grown staple crop in Africa – more than 300 million Africans depend on it as their main food source – and it is severely affected by frequent drought.</p><p>Meanwhile, Indonesia has approved planting of the world's first drought-tolerant sugarcane, and it plans to commercialise it this year, according to the ISAAA. Bangladesh has approved commercial cultivation of eggplant that has been genetically modified to resist insect damage. \"That's significant,\" said James, because \"Bangladesh is one of the poorest of the poor. Very small area. Huge population.\"</p><p>Biotech crops remain controversial, and not just in Europe. While the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute is part of the Gates and Buffett foundation-funded effort to develop  drought-resistant corn, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-torn-over-kenya-s-recent-gm-food-ban-1.11929\" title=\"\">Kenya's cabinet banned imports of GMOs in 2012</a>. China does not permit biotech crops to be grown for food.</p><p>That said, the global survey is the best evidence we have that a growing number of farmers believe that biotech crops enable them to reduce costs, or improve their productivity, or work less. These farmers could be mistaken, of course; they are influenced by the seed companies, by their peers and, in the developing world, by the inducements of foundation or US government aid.</p><p>But as Steve Savage, an industry consultant who <a href=\"http://appliedmythology.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">blogs about agriculture</a>, told me, biotech crops are one of a number of key tools that should be made available to farmers, along with faster conventional breeding, better equipment, storage technology and crop protection chemicals:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The farmers are the ones who integrate all of this to continue making the sort of gains we have seen for decades. For developing world subsistence farmers, there are clearly cases where free GMO crops like virus resistant cassava would help a great deal, but they also need far more basic things like a functional farm-credit system, crop insurance, a bit of fertiliser and infrastructure for storage and transport to market. So it isn't about whether any one technology will \"feed the world\".  Farmers will feed the world and always have. We would do well to respect the choices they want to make.</p></blockquote>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/12/1392220649112/Hands-holding-wheat-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/food-blog/gm-debate-farmers-biotech-more-crops-survey","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/food-blog/gm-debate-farmers-biotech-more-crops-survey","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"A 'pause' in centuries of British wars is not enough | Seumas Milne","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-12T21:00:00Z","sectionId":"commentisfree","id":"commentisfree/2014/feb/12/pause-centuries-british-wars-elite-panicking","fields":{"body":"<p>The generals are beside themselves, Whitehall's in a panic.

It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2014/feb/11/britain-100-years-of-conflict\" title=\"\">an extraordinary and chilling record, unmatched by any other country</a>. Only France, Britain's historic rival colonial power, and the US, at the head of the first truly global empire, come close.</p><p>It's not as if other major powers have sent their soldiers to fight abroad with remotely such regularity, or at all. But when it comes to Britain, the line of uninterrupted armed action in any case stretches far further back than a century.</p><p>As Richard Gott's book <a href=\"http://www.versobooks.com/books/1017-britains-empire\" title=\"\">Britain's Empire</a> recounts, its forces were involved in violent suppression of anti-colonial rebellions every year from at least the 1760s for the next 200 years, quite apart from multiple other full-scale wars. You need to go back before Britain's foundation as a state and the English civil wars to find a time when government-backed privateers, slavers and settlers weren't involved in armed conflict somewhere in the world.</p><p>There are in fact only a handful of countries British troops haven't invaded at some point. What is so striking about the tally of the past 100 years is that only in 1940 were British troops actually defending their own country from the threat of invasion.</p><p>And there is a telling continuum between Britain's conflicts in the colonial period and the post-cold war world. The same names keep cropping up, a legacy of imperial divide-and-rule: from Ireland, Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine to Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Waziristan.</p><p>There's very little in this saga that the British – let alone those at the receiving end, from Kenya to Malaya – can seriously take pride in, even if they knew about it. (Who, for example, remembers the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2014/feb/11/britain-100-years-of-conflict\" title=\"\">killing of 15,000 Indonesian civilians by British troops</a> as they restored Dutch colonial rule in 1945?) Even the supposed successes of liberal interventionism, such as Kosovo and Libya, are scarred by escalated death tolls, ethnic cleansing and dysfunctional states.</p><p>What is it about Britain? Are its people really more warlike than others? In reality, England's early development of capitalism and technology gave its elite the edge over colonial rivals, while its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/20/past.hearafrica05\" title=\"\">plunder and economic power</a> was enforced by a dominant navy. That shaped British society and delivered wealth and clout to its rulers. But for the majority there were few if any benefits – one reason there was always a strong strand of domestic opposition to Britain's warmongering, from Charles James Fox to Keir Hardie.</p><p>It's the same, only more so, today. For the political and commercial elite, British warmaking under the wing of Washington is about state prestige, corporate profits and the protection of a system of global economic privilege. That was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/defence-and-security-blog/2014/feb/12/armed-forces-defence-army-navy\">clear message this week from the former first sea lord Sir Jonathon Band</a>, who now works for US defence contractor Lockheed Martin and insists that Britain's commitment to buy 48 F-35 fighter aircraft \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26124894\" title=\"\">will certainly not be enough</a>\".</p><p>The armed forces aren't defending the population against any military threat, but endangering them by feeding terror and racism. It's scarcely surprising that opposition to endless wars has grown in Britain, as it has in the US and other allied states. The historian Linda Colley speculates Britain might even revert to the kind of scepticism about the military that prevailed in the 17th century before the years of unbridled imperial conquest – which would be a relief all round.</p><p>The top brass meanwhile claim withdrawal from Afghanistan will be a \"strategic pause\". Instead of a full pullout, the plan is for greater use of drones, special forces and trainers – until they can \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/11/british-forces-century-warfare-end\" title=\"\">get on to the horse again</a>\" and the public can be corralled to acquiesce in another \"humanitarian\" intervention.</p><p>That's likely to prove harder than before. Each war attracts less support than the last. Britain has a chance to turn its back on centuries of warmaking, shake off the mentality of junior global policeman and start to build a different relationship with the rest of the world.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/12/1392237992816/Matt-Kenyon-illustration--006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/12/pause-centuries-british-wars-elite-panicking","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/12/pause-centuries-british-wars-elite-panicking","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"New financing models bring greener products to developing countries","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-12T17:33:35Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/innovative-financing-models-simpa-lifestraw","fields":{"body":"<p>Rice paddies and colorful tractors are common sights in remote parts of south India. So, too, are small shanties, brightly painted shops and coconut palms. But nowadays, in some villages, solar panels have also become part of the landscape, covering shingled roofs and competing with the palms for sunlight.</p><p>The panels are helping to catapult energy-poor villagers – who previously had no, or only very limited, electricity – into a more sustainable future. This leap to renewable energy is the result of an innovative business model that's being rolled out to low-income communities in the state of Karnataka. </p><p>The company behind this new model is Simpa Networks, a technology company that aims to make sustainable energy affordable to all – even those who make less than $2 a day. In particular, Simpa targets customers who have limited access to electricity and use kerosene lanterns, which can pose health and safety risks, to illuminate their small homes. It also targets customers with little, if any, disposable income, who can't afford to buy its solar products for $200 to $400 each – even though Simpa claims its system could <a href=\"http://simpanetworks.com/energy-as-opportunity/\">yield significant savings</a> over its 10-year lifespan. </p><p>How can it make money from these low-income customers? Simpa has turned to innovative product financing, one of the business-model innovations identified in <a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/library/model-behavior#.UvufKV7Oz6Q\">Model Behavior</a>, a report I co-authored that SustainAbility released today. </p><p>Instead of paying the full price upfront, customers make a small initial down payment for a high-quality solar photovoltaic system and pre-pay for the energy service, activating their systems in small increments using a mobile phone. Each payment for energy also contributes toward the final purchase price of the system. Once fully paid off, the system unlocks permanently and produces free energy for the rest of its life. </p><p>The model is based on the concept of solar leases, which many US-based businesses are deploying to install solar panels on rooftops across the nation. <a href=\"http://www.sunedison.com/\">SunEdison</a>, <a href=\"http://www.solarcity.com/\">SolarCity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.borregosolar.com/\">Borrego Solar</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sunrun.com/\">Sunrun</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sungevity.com/\">Sungevity</a>, among others, provide solar panels to commercial customers via power-purchase agreements. The solar companies install and maintain the solar-power systems, while customers pay for the electricity they use – and investors buy into the systems to take advantage of the 30% federal tax credit for renewable energy. </p><p>The idea is similar to the various financing and credit options offered at car dealerships or for home buying. Now the model is also being applied to other products aimed at low-income consumers in developing countries. Vestergaard, a company that produces health interventions like mosquito nets and fly screens for low-income populations, is experimenting with a new financing model to bring cleaner water to communities in Kenya. One of its products, the Lifestraw Family water filter, provides safe drinking water to families without access to piped water. </p><p>In 2011, Vestergaard delivered 880,000 filters to 4.5 million families in Kenya's Western Province, <a href=\"http://csi.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/csi.gsb.stanford.edu/files/LifeStraw-SustainableFunding.pdf\">spending $30m</a> on distribution, preparation, training and support for the program over its 10-year life cycle. Instead of selling water filters directly to families, Vestergaard hopes to recoup its investment by collecting carbon credits from the Kenyan government. It will be eligible for these credits if enough families use the water filters instead of burning firewood to boil and purify water, which emits carbon into the atmosphere.</p><p>These products and business models are not without critics, and <a href=\"http://www.good.is/posts/how-not-to-save-the-world-or-why-the-lifestraw-is-a-stupid-idea\">some are skeptical</a> of the Lifestraw's utility. It will still be years before the effectiveness of its carbon-credit model, and the viability of its proposed partnership with the Kenyan government, can be evaluated. Meanwhile, some remain wary of US-based solar leasing companies, which retain ownership of the solar panels, thereby keeping the federal tax credit rather than allowing homeowners to benefit. </p><p>However, most of these criticisms tend to be focused on the product or the policies related to that product, rather than the model itself. In the case of the LifeStraw Family, a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2937016/\">2010 randomized control trial</a> in the Congo showed that a majority of recipient families were using the filter, but continued to drink untreated water as well, which reduced the effectiveness rates of the filter in preventing diarrhea. The model, however, has <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/clean-water-at-no-cost-just-add-carbon-credits/\">received accolades</a> for its innovative design. </p><p>Product financing is not a new business model; rather, it is being used in new ways to get environmentally friendly products into the marketplace. Because these products can be more expensive, novel or untested, innovative financing schemes can help companies overcome barriers to adopting new technologies, which is key to securing a more sustainable future. </p><p><em>Lindsay Clinton is a senior manager at <a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/\">SustainAbility</a> in New York and co-author of <a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/library/model-behavior#.UvufKV7Oz6Q\">Model Behavior</a>, a new report on business model innovation for sustainability</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/3/1370260013646/A-man-installs-a-solar-pa-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/innovative-financing-models-simpa-lifestraw","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/innovative-financing-models-simpa-lifestraw","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"Former GCHQ boss Sir David Omand questioned by MPs: Politics live blog","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-11T18:47:43Z","sectionId":"politics","id":"politics/blog/2014/feb/11/lord-birt-and-greg-dyke-questioned-by-mps-about-the-bbc-politics-live-blog","fields":{"body":"<div id=\"block-52fa64d2e4b0b8d3ae1a9d3b\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-11T18:36:03.783Z\">6.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">David Omand's evidence to the home affairs committee - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are the main points from David Omand’s evidence to the home affairs committee about the Edward Snowden affair.</p> <p><b>• David Omand, a former head of GCHQ, said the Edward Snowden revelations would lead to a loss of intelligence.</b> He made the comment when asked if they would involve a financial cost to Britain. He replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There will be a cost effect. I would find it quite hard to know exactly how you would calculate it. The technology, to keep moving, you are continually reinvesting. </p> <p>What I think is more concerning is a loss of intelligence, at least for a period of some years. So there will be less information, less knowledge on which to base decisions. </p> </blockquote> <p><b>• He said the revelations could make it harder for the intelligence agencies to recruit.</b> Parents would not want their children to join an agency accused of questionable conduct, he suggested.</p> <p><b>• He said he was no longer certain that the secret material taken by Edward Snowden was in the hands of the Chinese and the Russians.</b> Keith Vaz, the committee chairman, read Omand what he said about this last year. Omand said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The assumption the experts are working on is that all that information or almost all of it will now be in the hands of Moscow and Beijing. It’s the most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever, much worse than Burgess and Maclean.</p> </blockquote> <p>Today Omand said he stood by the second part of that statement. But he went on:<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More has emerged about the security measures taken by Mr Snowden to try and ensure he had control of his material. It is still my assessment that it is unlikely that intelligence services of the professionalism of both the Chinese and Russian services have not found ways of accessing at least some of this material. Even if it was heavily encrypted, over a period of time they would be able to uncover it. </p> </blockquote> <p><b>• He said he thought the main advantage of having intelligence chiefs give evidence to parliamentarians in public was that it enabled the public to judge their “moral fibre”.</b> These hearing were not suitable for discussing secret matters, he said.</p> <p><b>• He said a code of conduct used by the intelligence agencies should be rewritten to spell out more clearly what they actually do.</b></p> <p><b>• He struggled to explain why MPs were told Britain was not involved in America’s extraordinary rendition programme when that was not true.</b> Two Conservative MPs, James Clappison and Mark Reckless, expressed particular anger about this. Omand said it was hard to address this without going into specific details, which he was not prepared to do. But he did say that he thinks guidance to intelligence officials explaining what was and what was not allowed should have been issued earlier. </p> <p><b>• He said assessing whether British agents were or were not complicit with torture was a complicated matter.</b> It raised questions about what kind of relationship was appropriate with a country guilty of mistreating suspects, he said.</p> <p><b>• He said that bulk access to the internet was not the same as mass surveillance. </b>But this mistake coloured the way the Snowden revelations were reported, he said.</p> <p><b>• He said he did not regard Edward Snowden as a proper whistleblower.</b> Snowden should have taken his concerns to Congress before taking information and giving it to the press, he said.</p> <p><b>• Omand said the Syrian civil war had given a boost to al-Qaida.</b></p> <p>That’s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-11T18:47:43.853Z\">at 6.47pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52fa5326e4b0b8d3ae1a9d05\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-11T17:01:17.918Z\">5.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Keith Vaz goes next.</p> <p>Q: You said on Radio 4 that we had the brains, and the Americans had the money.</p> <p>It was a joke, says Omand.

Or localisation. Or patient involvement. All can be of benefit. But this is a speech by a man who yearns for power and who thinks it is all that matters in life. And he’s wrong. My own experience tells me that most people are more than willing to forego decision making on many issues to others, most of whom they will consider to be experts on issues where they need advice. And others – very many others – simply don’t want power.</p> <p>I remember when I was quite a young auditor asking questions of a senior manager in a company and he made quite clear I was addressing my questions to the wrong person. As he made obvious he was number two in the company, and it was by choice. “I am a great number two”, he said. And he was. “And I’m not suited to be number one. He’s next door. Go and ask him.” And I did.</p> <p>John (for that was his name) was a wise man, and he taught me a valuable lesson. It’s not just that not everyone wants power, but that some are wise enough to realise it is not for them to have. They don’t want to, and maybe can’t, make the decisions that power demands of them. Which is absolutely fine. They can manages the consequences of power, implement the decisions taken with considerable ability and prepare information that informs the decision making process. But to pretend all want power is absurd. Some (in fact, I’ll be candid, experience suggests that this is many) don’t want to be in charge on a whole wide range of issues. I think none the less of them for that. I just think it’s absurd to pretend they have a quality they don’t possess when they have plenty of others to celebrate instead.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/11/ed-miliband-inequality-2015-election\">• Jonathan Freedland at Comment is free says the most revealing aspect of the speech was what Miliband said about inequality.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Expect him also to argue in the coming months that there is a link between inequality and the stability of our financial system: if the middle is ever more squeezed, with families racking up huge levels of personal debt to cope, then that leads to financial instability.</p> <p>The problems of this approach are multiple. For one thing, opponents from the right will say this confirms that Miliband is too big a risk to be PM, that under the surface he’s still Red Ed.</p> <p>More serious is that, by talking of inequality, he invites the obvious question: what are you going to do about it? He has no ready answer for that. What, for example, would he do about <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/10543136/Barclays-chief-Antony-Jenkins-defends-controversial-bank-bonuses.html\">a Barclays boss </a>who six weeks ago said he would only reward staff for performance – yet is about to pay out 10% more in bonuses even though the bank’s profits are down 32%? That represents a bonanza of £2.38bn for Barclays staff in bonuses alone.</p> <p>Miliband knows that a top 1% – or even a top 0.1% – soaring into the stratosphere, cutting loose from everyone else, is having a destructive effect on British society, warping, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/06/hackney-house-price-bubble\">the housing market in London and the south-east</a>. He believes he has to speak about it. It won’t be easy; the risks are clear. But he is surely right to think politicians can ignore it no longer.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/02/labour-and-state?utm_content=buffer175af&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer  \">• Jeremy Cliffe at the Economist’s Blighty Britain blog wonders if Miliband is serious about recasting the British state - and suggests that challenging universalism would be a way forward.</a><br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Britain’s welfare system is not particularly generous by international comparison. But it is especially indulgent towards those households with above-median income: paying them when they have children, subsidising their children’s university fees, caring for them when they get ill, paying each member some £110 a week for the last decades of their life and caring for them when they frail. These benefits are essential for the hard-up, but not for the comfortable. Yet in 2011/12 the British state paid £110 billion in benefits to the richer-than-average, or £4,148 per household). For comparison, that is more than the health budget.</p> <p>Why? The standard defence of this universalism is that, by sustaining common benefits, it keeps British society cohesive, and secures a middle-class lobby for the welfare state. This is a well-intentioned goal, one consistent with Labour’s “one nation” slogan. But, as the philosopher Roberto Unger argues, cohesion comes from shared places and experiences, not cheques in the mail. At a time when whole hunks of government are being hacked off (and the only credible alternative being massive tax hikes), does universalism really justify the £110 billion price tag? Labour has already started to ask that question. Dipping its toe into the water, last summer the party announced that it opposes winter fuel allowances for those on high incomes. But that only saves £100m, a 0.09% drop in the “welfare for the wealthy” ocean.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://shiftinggrounds.org/2014/02/has-ed-embraced-his-inner-anarchist/\">• Molly Conisbee at Shifting Grounds says there were hints of anarchist thinking in Miliband’s speech.</a><br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Miliband (following Karl Marx – Ralph would be proud!) argues that inequality can only really be addressed by exploring and deconstructing current power relationships. That is to say that equality in and of itself is an abstract pursuit, generally parroted by those who have no intention of addressing the structural basis that creates inequality in the first place. In fact a more communitarian model, that recognised the importance of social organising and networks, could be a means of revived economic and social realms.</p> <p>In this analysis, Miliband edges towards elements of anarchist thinking, which often crop up when political parties – even the Tories – experience a period of opposition rather than government. Empowered localism, the creativity of communities and genuine grassroots engagement all appear to be extremely attractive to politicians who are not in control of big departments and budgets. Surely this is the way to re-engage, to increase individual party membership and to fill the town halls with participants once again eager to engage in civic society?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/2014/02/ed-milibands-hugo-young-lecture-a-thoughtful-speech-ridiculously-spun\">• Tom Watson on his blog says he was unhappy about the suggestion that Miliband would govern like Margaret Thatcher.</a><br /></p> <p><i>UPDATE</i>: I’ve just seen this, which is worth adding.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rsablogs.org.uk/2014/enterprise/revolutionary-incrementalist-modern-fable/\">• Anthony Painter at the RSA says there were two themes in the speech, which are ultimately contradictory.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last night, Ed Miliband stepped on the territory of public service reform in his <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2014/02/ed-milibands-hugo-young-lecture-full-text/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+LabourListLatestPosts+(LabourList)\">Hugo Young lecture</a>. It was in fact two speeches delivered by two different voices: that of a Fabian incrementalist and a voice of radical creativity. These two voices rarely remain in harmony for long and that is the challenge Miliband now faces: the choice he will inevitably have to make if in office.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-11T15:39:41.632Z\">at 3.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52fa231ce4b0f46aae2d12ec\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-11T14:04:45.607Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/11/uk-floods-david-cameron-downing-street-press-conference\"><b>• David Cameron has announced that on his returning from his tour of the flood-hit south-west he will hold a rare press conference in Downing Street this afternoon, in what is being seen as a bid to show that the government is getting a grip on the crisis.</b></a> There is full coverage of the flooding crisis<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2014/feb/11/flood-crisis-intensifies-in-the-thames-valley-live-updates\"> on our floods live blog. </a>The press conference will be at 4.45pm.

No 10 has attempted to veto Theresa May’s proposals to curtail use of the powers but the Home Secretary is refusing to back down. After more than a month of simmering tension, insiders believe the issue could be about to explode. “There is a complete stand-off,” one senior Tory says. “Theresa May is the one member of the Cabinet that David Cameron is frightened of — she’s the only minister who will go eyeball to eyeball with him and say ‘no’.” </p> <p>Gordon Brown’s allies used to describe Harriet Harman as the “killer driller” who wore down her opponents until they gave in. Now Conservative ministers speak of the Home Secretary’s steely single-mindedness in similarly awestruck tones. “There is no warmth, but the cold determination is rather effective,” says one colleague. </p> <p>On stop and search, Mrs May has worked assiduously to build an alliance over the past few weeks. The Deputy Prime Minister, who chairs the Cabinet Home Affairs Committee — has written to the Home Office agreeing that reform is overdue. “This is not something you can always say but on this issue Theresa May and Nick Clegg are absolutely at one,” says a Liberal Democrat source. Oliver Letwin, the liberal-minded Cabinet Office minister and Tory policy fixer, is also supporting the Home Secretary over the Prime Minister. </p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/whos-responsible-for-the-hopeless-response-to-the-floods-in-typical-british-fashion-its-everyone-and-no-one-9119311.html\">• Steve Richards in the Independent says the flooding crisis illustrates a problem with responsibility.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After the election, to a chorus of cheers from most of the media, inexperienced ministers rushed around looking for cuts. Those ministers who cut fastest and deepest were most praised. Spending on flood defences was an early target, along with the overall budget of the Environment Agency. <br /></p> <p>Now, those same parts of the media are screaming about the response to the floods, another example of the mad “tax and spend” debate where cuts are praised in general and condemned when specific consequences arise. The incoherence of the broader ideological debate about the role of the state extends further. Pre-floods, I heard interviews with Right-wing farmers in Somerset and elsewhere calling for the Government to get off their backs. <br /></p> <p>Now, they are crying out for intervention.

He has been giving interviews this morning.

Then he visited Uganda, followed by eight other sub-Saharan African countries and India. </p><p>While visiting cities and rural villages, Lin and his colleagues at San Francisco-based <a href=\"http://fenixintl.com/\">Fenix International</a> saw people using candles and kerosene lamps. More surprisingly, they noticed others who made light in creative ways, such as by duct-taping AA batteries to motorcycle tail lights or constructing their own LED lights with found electronics. </p><p>Inspired by the improvised lighting he saw on the trip, Lin developed a new product: a portable battery that could be charged via a solar panel, bicycle generator or a household outlet. Called the ReadySet, the battery enables small business owners in Uganda and Kenya to earn money by charging other people's cell phones and to light their stores at night.</p><p>In partnership with telecom company MTN, Fenix launched ReadySet in 2012 and, late last year, began offering a \"<a href=\"http://fenixintl.com/2013/12/19/fenix-international-and-mtn-launch-readypay-pay-as-you-go-solar-power-in-africa/\">pay as you go</a>\" purchase method for home lighting. </p><p>\"You have to take the time and actually set your assumptions aside … and be humble,\" says Lin, who still spends about half his time away from San Francisco. \"When you understand the local context, it gives you an understanding of the local culture and how they use light.\" </p><p>Lin is among a growing number of designers and entrepreneurs making goods for developing countries, where the introduction of electrically powered lights can be life-changing. It's estimated that upwards of a billion people do not have access to reliable electricity, with about 65% of them in Asia, according to a <a href=\"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/09/24/000356161_20120924050105/Rendered/PDF/727000WP0Box370ighting0Report072512.pdf\">World Bank Report</a> in 2012. Often, off-grid households in Asia and Africa rely on kerosene lamps, which provide weak light, pollute and cause respiratory problems. Poor lighting also makes it difficult for children to study at night, hindering their education.  </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429517298'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/10/1392058897386/LuminAID_MAIN.jpg' alt='LuminAid' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The LuminAid light, which combines a solar cell and battery with an inflatable bag, aided relief efforts in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Photograph: LuminAid</figcaption></figure><h2>Solar alternatives</h2><p>Solar lanterns – portable lamps that combine a small solar panel, battery and LED lights – are a common tool for bringing light to off-grid locations in developing countries. But a number of clever alternatives have emerged which could help accelerate the spread of off-grid lights. The International Finance Corporation of the World Bank last year cited an influx of solar lanterns, but noted that some products of \"unknown quality\" in Africa have begun to \"undermine consumer and investor confidence\". </p><p>One of these innovative products emerged from a challenge by charity <a href=\"http://solar-aid.org/\">SolarAid</a> to make a solar lantern for less than $10. Two British designers took on the project, but over time they realized that a light didn't necessarily need a solar panel. With the help of crowdfunding, they designed a device, called <a href=\"http://deciwatt.org/\">GravityLight</a>, which produces light from the small amount of power created by a heavy bag pulling on a cable. As the cable slowly drops from the weight of the bag, it creates light for 25 minutes before being reset. Deciwatt, the group making the device, began trials in Liberia, Guatemala, the Philippines and India late last year and will roll out the GravityLight in the UK and US later this year.</p><p>Another alternative to lanterns is the <a href=\"http://aliteroflight.org/index.php\">Liter of Light</a>, also called the Solar Bottle Bulb, which provides overhead illumination without electricity. Originally <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/innovations-in-light/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">designed by a mechanic</a> during a prolonged power outage in Sao Paolo, Brazil, the light fixture is a plastic bottle filled with water and chlorine bleach fitted into a corrugated metal roof. The bottle refracts incoming sunlight into the building, providing the same amount of light as a 55-watt incandescent bulb.</p><p>A number of designers are looking at additions to the standard lantern model. <a href=\"http://www.luminaid.com/\">LuminAid</a>, for instance, is making a solar-powered light that combines a solar cell and battery with an inflatable bag. The design makes the light more compact and better suited to disaster relief situations. For every eight flashlights, relief organizations can send 50 solar bags. LuminAid was used during relief efforts in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. </p><h2>Eco-light</h2><p>Designers at Nottingham Trent University decided to make sustainability the focal point of their <a href=\"http://www.ntu.ac.uk/apps/news/154096-6/Eco-lights_made_from_recycled_cola_bottles_illuminate_a_sustainable_future.aspx\">Eco-light</a>, which will initially be sold to consumers in Sweden but is also suitable for developing countries, says Daizhong Su, the head of the university's Advanced Design and Manufacturing Engineering Centre, who headed up research on the project. </p><p>The light fixture consists of a series of cubes made from recycled PET, the plastic used for bottled water and soft drinks. The cubes can be rotated on a stem to alter the light direction and consumers can choose how many cubes to include. In addition to choosing recyclable material, Su designed the product so it can be assembled with clips, rather than screws, making it easy to disassemble and recycle at the end of its life. </p><p>\"If our [light] product has the same light production and the same cost, people will purchase our product because it has less impact on the environment,\" he says.</p><p>Designers could use recycled plastic in many other everyday products, says Su, who is leading another project to make floor tiles with another type of recycled plastic. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-429517299'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/11/1392160901997/LiterofLight2_MAIN.jpg' alt='Liter of Light' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Liter of Light - a plastic bottle filled with water and chlorine bleach, then afixed to a corrugated metal roof - refracts sunlight into buildings. Photograph: Liter of Light</figcaption></figure><p>In general, products for the developing world need to be very low-cost, rugged and easy to use and repair, says Lin, who was a lecturer in design at Stanford University before starting Fenix International. But he warns against fixating so much on lower cost that the product no longer meets users' needs. </p><p>\"The vanguard of product design, especially for the developing world, is to design for extreme affordability,\" he says. \"There's certainly a lot to be said for price point, but at the same time the most important aspect of the product design might not be price alone.\"</p><h2>Plenty of room for innovation</h2><p>In addition to product innovation, there's a great need for business model innovation, as traditional business models can sometimes hinder access to these new lighting products. While national utilities and government agencies distribute lighting products, they often still come with high upfront costs, which hampers the market's development. In response, entrepreneurs have started to offer pay-as-you-go or pay-to-own business models for lighting and energy-related products. </p><p><a href=\"http://meragaopower.com/\">Mera Gao Power</a>, for instance, builds and operates solar-powered microgrids in off-grid villages of Uttar Pradesh, India. Consumers pay a weekly fee for seven hours of power a night, which poor people in India prefer over buying a product, co-founder <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUkEBDPUoLA&amp;list=PLyyl3ZP6Sz2Je7LpJ64zR3PXBcWdpPcPX\">Nikhil Jaisinghani said last year at a seminar on energy</a> for the developing world at Stanford's Precourt Institute for Energy. </p><p>As a social enterprise, the company seeks to improve people's lives and, at the same time, earn a profit so that it can grow and impact millions of people. Initial customers reported that having light has led to children spending 50% more time studying, Jaisinghani says. </p><p>\"We've had customers able to operate shops late into the night. We've had customers able to make saris at night and sell them to large retailers and wholesalers,\" he says. \"We've got people who are simply happy to have a better environment in which to do their daily chores.\"</p><p><em>Martin LaMonica is a Boston-based reporter covering energy, technology, business and the environment.

British crews piloted US Reaper and Predator drones in Afghanistan on 2,150 occasions between 2006 and 2012 – an average of almost once a day.</p><p>That does not include the thousands of missions British forces have flown with their own fleet of 10 Reaper aircraft.</p><p>The MoD has also for the first time provided a breakdown of the number of missiles fired by UK drones every month between May 2008 and April 2013.</p><p>These attacks peaked in November 2011, when 25 missiles were fired. There has been only one month in which no missiles were launched – December 2008.</p><p>Latest figures show RAF drones fired 94 Hellfire missiles in Afghanistan during 2013, bringing the total number of munitions and bombs fired by British unmanned systems since 2008 to 457.</p><p>The figures were released last week, nine months after a freedom of information (FoI) request, to <a href=\"http://dronewars.net/\" title=\"\">Drone Wars UK</a>, a website that researches and monitors the British use of unmanned technologies.</p><p>The website's creator, Chris Cole, said: \"This latest revelation once again demonstrates the secrecy surrounding the use of armed drones and once again underlines the need for increased scrutiny and greater transparency about their use.</p><p>\"The nature of drone technology means  they are being used with little or no public accountability.</p><p>\"Unless we act now to curb this new weaponry it seems inevitable that drones will increasingly be used to launch secret and unaccountable military attacks leading to global instability and increased insecurity.\"</p><p>Heather Barr, of Human Rights Watch, added: \"One of the problems with drone programmes from the beginning has been a near-total lack of transparency about the scale of the programmes, where they were operating, what their goals are, and who they are targeting and how. If it is now not even possible to know which country has its finger on the button, that adds yet another layer of confusion which will make accountability even more elusive.\"</p><p>The MoD statement to Drone Wars UK makes clear British pilots were flying US drones in Afghanistan long before the RAF had any unmanned aircraft of its  own; the UK did not start flying its own Reapers in Afghanistan until mid-2008.</p><p>The FoI reply states: \"Between October 2006 and 31 December 2012, UK aircrew had flown approximately 2,150 operational missions using US Reaper and Predator remotely piloted air systems (RPAS) in support of operations in Afghanistan and Libya.</p><p>\"UK and US personnel also operate both nations' RPAS as part of the launch and recovery phase in Afghanistan. Of the 2,150 missions flown by UK personnel, there were 271 missions in Afghanistan when UK personnel utilised a US Reaper as a UK Reaper was unavailable. During these missions, UK personnel released 39 weapons.\"</p><p>While the MoD gave some details about operations in which the UK has borrowed US equipment, it refused to give details about operations flown by British crews formally within the US air force. \"I am withholding information about weapons released by UK personnel embedded with the US air force on operations in Afghanistan and Libya,\" the letter says.</p><p>\"I have carried out a public interest test. Releasing the information would provide a limited additional understanding of the UK's relationship with the US over that which is already in the public domain in relation to operations in Afghanistan.</p><p>\"Releasing the information concerned, when the other government has not given permission to do so, would undermine the relationship of trust that exists between the UK and other countries. Consequently, I am withholding the information. Information is not held for operations in Iraq.\"</p><p>Cole said it was essential that information about drone operations undertaken by British RAF pilots while embedded with US forces be made available for public scrutiny and debate.\"</p><p>He called on the defence select committee, which is holding an inquiry into drones, to reconsider its decision to hold its sessions in private.</p><p>The MoD insists drones operate under the same rules as other aircraft: \"The RAF and USAF continue to work closely to provide persistent armed intelligence and surveillance to allied armed forces in Afghanistan. This occasionally involves the RAF utilising USAF assets when UK aircraft are unavailable. These aircraft always operate on UK tasks, with RAF aircrew in control, using UK rules of engagement.\"</p><p>The MoD has yet to decide what it will do with its fleet of armed Reapers once UK forces have left Helmand province at the end of combat operations this December.</p><p>Under current rules, the aircraft cannot be flown in the UK. The MoD is considering options that might include basing the drones in Kenya to support military operations against terrorists in the Horn of Africa.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/9/1391949872686/-RAF-launched-missiles-in-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/09/raf-british-crews-missiles-afghanistan-us-drones-mod","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/feb/09/raf-british-crews-missiles-afghanistan-us-drones-mod","sectionName":"UK news"},{"webTitle":"Details of confirmed speakers","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-06T15:22:04Z","sectionId":"global-supply-chains-summit","id":"global-supply-chains-summit/guardian-global-supply-chains-summit-speakers","fields":{"body":"<p>Summit speakers, made up of keynotes, business and investment leaders and practitioners will:</p><p>• Provide overall context and emphasise the importance of this issues to be discussed<br />• Speak about their own experience and challenges and reinforce the need to engage with this agenda as a key concern for all business<br />• Set out and share examples of the challenges, what is happening and what could be done</p><h2>David Abramowitz, vice president for policy and government relations, Humanity United </h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-433576380'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/10/1392044862961/DavidA.jpg' alt='David A' width='140' height='84' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>David is vice president for policy and government relations at Humanity United.

Under current production patterns, much of the increase would need to come from smallholder family farmers in developing countries, including the poorest, who cultivate about 80% of arable land and <a href=\"http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/how-do-smallholder-farmers-fit-into-the-big-picture-of-world-food-production\" title=\"\">produce most of the world's food</a>. Improving productivity and intensifying crop production among these farmers could therefore be key to global food security and ending hunger.</p><p>This is easier said than done. The world possesses the technologies to significantly step up farm productivity, including through <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/181017/icode/\" title=\"\">\"climate smart\" methods</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unescap.org/tid/publication/tipub2614-chap10.pdf\" title=\"\">technologies</a> designed to help adapt farming processes to environmental changes. But can we expect these to be adopted widely by farmers around the world?</p><p>Small-scale family farmers in developing countries tend to find it difficult to access these technologies, because of <a href=\"http://www.europafrica.info/en/themes/struggling-smallholders\" title=\"\">poor infrastructure, low education and lack of financial credit</a>. Many of them live and work in vulnerable ecosystems that may become even more fragile because of climate change, as was highlighted in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2013/nov/07/climate-change-environment-food-security-ipcc-emissions-united-nations-global-warming\" title=\"\">recent report</a> from the UN's international panel on climate change.</p><p>Aside from these well-known hurdles, what is less often discussed is the demographic challenge that could limit global food production. Farmer populations are ageing rapidly. Worldwide, the <a href=\"http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/129168/2/(2)%20Johr.pdf\" title=\"\">average age of farmers is about 60</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.helpage.org/download/4f50e3dfe2d5c/\" title=\"\">in developing countries</a>, and many amongst them are women and poorly educated. Older farmers are less likely to introduce new, transformative production techniques.</p><p>One could expect their children to do so, especially in developing countries where <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Documentation/pdf/WPP2012_HIGHLIGHTS.pdf\" title=\"\">60% of the population is under 25 years of age</a> and most living in rural areas. The problem is, however, that <a href=\"http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/eu/learn/article/-/asset_publisher/gH3p5kyPWgQs/content/36428/654016\" title=\"\">few rural youth see a future for themselves in agriculture</a>. At the same time, by 2030, 60% of the world's population is <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Documentation/pdf/WPP2012_HIGHLIGHTS.pdf\" title=\"\">projected to live in urban areas</a>. As <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wess/wess_current/2011wess.pdf\" title=\"\">urban populations consume higher-protein food</a>, the demand for meat and processed food is rising, which is expanding land use for livestock production, further accelerating deforestation and increasing greenhouse gas emissions by agriculture.</p><p>Can these challenges all be addressed simultaneously? Yes, but only with concerted efforts on a number of fronts. Key for change will be a focus on supporting farmers to design their own programmes and engaging young farmers.</p><p>Farmer-led innovations tend to work well, as farmers know their terrain and can pre-empt how different processes will work. In Niger, for instance, farmers started experimenting with a low-cost way of reproducing and generating trees and shrubs that provide food, fuel and fodder in the 1980s. These days, in the areas where this started, 1.25m trees are added every year. Other \"<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/ag/save-and-grow/en/factsheets/index.html\" title=\"\">save and grow</a>\" practices, such as low-tillage farming, water-efficient cropping, ecology-friendly pest management have been successfully applied to a whole range of crops such as rice, cassava and other staples with smallholder farmers as primary drivers. More farmer-led success stories have been the <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/oc64ch07.pdf%E2%80%8E\" title=\"\">re-greening of the Sahel in Burkina Faso</a>, which used agroforestry to rehabilite arid landscapes into productive land, and <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp00916.pdf%E2%80%8E\" title=\"\">zero-tillage on the Indo-Gangetic Plain</a>, which set a precedent for farms keeping soil covers for higher yields, less fuel use and tractor wear and tear.</p><p>Such successful <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/oc64ch07.pdf\" title=\"\">farmer-managed regeneration processes</a> could be rolled out on a larger scale if farmers were more able to interact with and learn from each other. So how can can this be done?</p><h2><strong>Farmer organisations</strong></h2><p>Development groups can encourage knowledge sharing by helping communities to bring farmers of all ages together through farmer organisations. Given a platform to mobilise and discuss issues that affect their work, farmers can share best practice and collectively manage market prices. In Kenya's Rift Valley, for instance, the <a href=\"http://weadapt.org/knowledge-base/synergies-between-adaptation-and-mitigation/climate-smart-agriculture-put-into-practice-in-smallholder-dairy-development-project-in-kenya\" title=\"\">Kaptumo dairy farmers business association has been instrumental</a> in greening livestock farming while substantially enhancing farm incomes.</p><h2><strong>Engage youth</strong></h2><p>In order to engage and encourage younger farmers in such initiatives, target institutions such as <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/knowledge/goodpractices/bp-gender-equity-in-rural/bp-junior-farmer-field/en/\" title=\"\">youth farm field and life schools</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_ent/documents/publication/wcms_176540.pdf\" title=\"\">youth entrepreneurship facilities</a>. In many parts of Africa and Asia these have improved life attitudes and skills of rural youth and help them start a business of their own, both on and off the farm. The development community can help forge effective partnerships for such initiatives.</p><p>In Tanzania and Zanzibar, for instance, the FAO in conjunction with local authorities, the ministry of agriculture and natural resources, introduced <a href=\"http://www.fao-ilo.org/news-ilo/detail/en/c/143823/?no_cache=1\" title=\"\">youth-targeted training in organic farming</a>. The young trainees returned to their communities, where they retrained their peers, raising awareness of organic agriculture and finding buoyant local markets for their produce, including the booming hotel industry.</p><p>The development community should give priority to financing major investments in further developing \"save and grow\" and other climate-smart technologies for a wide range of crops, and facilitate their local adaptation through partnerships with local communities and producer organisations. Improving rural infrastructure will be crucial to improving smallholders' access to markets. But none of these efforts will be enough to ensure global food security, without also supporting programmes promoting opportunities for young farmers.</p><p><em>Rob Vos coordinates the strategic programme on rural poverty reduction at the </em><a href=\"http://www.fao.org/%E2%80%8E\" title=\"\"><em>Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations</em></a><em>.

Uganda's Stephen Kiprotich, though, the current Olympic and world champion, believes there's room for optimism.</p><p>\"Lowering the record to 2:02 will be done soon, definitely before the next Olympics in Rio,\" he said. \"Then it will again take some time. The sub-two-hour marathon will happen, but it's impossible to set a timeline. But the good thing is that in the past few years, training camps in Africa have professionalised a lot. When I was a teenager we just trained; now I have a coach, a physio, a manager, a GPS watch. We have people during long runs who assist with drinks to simulate drinking station situations. All these things make a difference. But we still have lot of room to improve if you compare our training camps with some of the European and American runners. They have a lot of technology and knowledge we don't have.\"</p><p>Epstein believes that the feat is beyond the current generation, and suggests it may not even happen within our lifetime. Such are the physiological challenges that ultimately it will come down to the evolution of our genes.</p><p>\"The faster the races are getting, the more people are ruled out purely because of their genetics,\" he said. \"Oxygen capacity is what sets the pros aside from everyone else in the field, but what separates the pros from each other is usually running economy, and that's largely something that you're born with. You can improve what you have through working hard – and Paula Radcliffe was a great example of that. She improved her running economy with altitude training and she lost weight while she was still growing. However, there's still a certain body type that you naturally need to have, and of course you have to combine that with ferocious training.\"</p><p>But would it be possible to spot a runner with the ideal genetic makeup and nurture their potential from an early age? A lot depends on how the genes are expressed, which is one of the most fascinating and little understood areas in medical science.</p><p>\"There's a lot of theory that living in a certain way turns the genes on and off, based on what the parents did when they were forming their germline DNA,\" Epstein explains. \"This means what your mother was doing when she's pregnant with you and what your father was doing when he was going into puberty.</p><p>\"But otherwise it's sort of unknown. I think there are certain lifestyle factors, specifically relating to runners in Kenya. A lot of them are primed for training, because they're not overweight and they grew up running, so they can start training really quickly instead of having to start by jogging. The first sub-two-hour marathon will probably be run by someone from east Africa.\"</p><p>We may have a while to wait, but whoever becomes the first to stop the clock at 1:59:59 will have accomplished one of the most significant achievements in sport. \"It will be a great milestone and an indicator of what the human body can do,\" says Kiprotich's coach Patrick Sang. \"It will show that what is impossible, can be possible.\"</p><p>Epstein believes that, in some ways, it may have a greater impact than the four-minute mile. \"That was obviously huge, and part of the psychological rebuilding of post-war Britain,\" he said. \"But the sport was also contained to a very small portion of the world at that point. Not that many people were competing in running, and not many countries recognised the mile in the same way that the United States and Britain do. But everyone recognises the marathon distance, and it's a globally competitive sport. The marathon has never been more popular – it's the greatest participator sport that we have going right now – so I think a lot of people could really relate to what it means.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2014/1/31/1391168374504/Wilson-Kipsang-crosses-th-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2014/jan/31/sub-two-hour-marathon-possible","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2014/jan/31/sub-two-hour-marathon-possible","sectionName":"Life and style"},{"webTitle":"Rwanda's next education challenge: teacher training and employability","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-29T13:05:44Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/jan/29/rwanda-education-teacher-training-youth-unemployment","fields":{"body":"<p>In the annual Unesco <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002256/225660e.pdf\" title=\"\">Education for All global monitoring report</a>, published on Wednesday, Rwanda is listed as one of three top performing countries in the world (with Laos and Vietnam) for reducing out-of-school populations by at least 85% over the past five years.</p><p>The  focus this year ison the quality of teaching and learning, a theme that has resonance for Rwanda, where access to education has been dramatically expanded – it <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/rwanda/education.html\" title=\"\">has the highest primary school enrollment rate in Africa</a> with 96.5% children in school – but there's evidence that this extension of reach has come at the expense of quality.</p><p><a href=\"http://icai.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DFIDs-Education-Programmes-in-Three-East-African-Countries-Final-Report-32.pdf\" title=\"\">Reporting in 2012</a> on its programmes in Rwanda, Tanzania and Ethiopia, the UK's Department for International Development writes: \"The evidence suggests that rapid expansion of enrollment has led to a decline in educational outcomes\". According to DfID, rapid growth in the education system has come at the expense of teaching excellence, with all all three countries forced to recruit less qualified teachers and many children finish primary school without the basic levels of literacy and numeracy.</p><p>\"It's true we've done a lot in terms of access to education but we have a lot to do in terms of improving the quality,\" Rwanda's education minister Vincent Biruta told the Global Development Professionals Network in London  at the <a href=\"http://www.ewf2014.org/\" title=\"\">World Education Forum</a> last week. His priority, he says, is to create a comprehensive study of educational attainment in his country and tackle the shortages in qualified teachers. \"At secondary level only 67% of teachers are [adequately] qualified … teacher training is at the centre of our strategy to improve the quality of education.\"</p><p>Biruta says the problem with universal measures of primary school education – as with the millennium development goals – is that while a subject like mathematics can be judged objectively, languages are different all over the world. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jan/16/rwanda-english-genocide\" title=\"\">In 2009 Rwanda decided to make English the language of instruction instead of French</a>,  strengthening ties with its English-speaking neighbours Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.

While there is <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/successfulsocieties/content/focusareas/CS/policynotes/view.xml?id=133\">limited comprehensive data</a> on the success of the imihigo system, Biruta calls it a \"very efficient tool\" to work with.</p><p>\"Performance contracts allow us to work against specific targets which are measurable, to align them with the resources that we can mobilise.\"  Asked whether the contracts will be used to gather data on literacy and numeracy, Biruta says: \"Yes maybe we will include a study of learning outcomes in our performance contracts in the future.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-428362164'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/28/1390912987995/Rwanda-education-minister-008.jpg' alt='Rwanda education minister Vincent Biruta' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Vincent Biruta, Rwanda's education minister, wants to create a comprehensive study of educational attainment in his country.

A phrase from the World Education Forum has stuck in Biruta's mind: \"It's not what you know, it's what you do with what you know.\" For him, that means a move away from traditional teaching methods in Rwanda to a more \"learner-centred\" approach.</p><p>\"Students may be able to answer exam questions but they need to be able to have the skills to go out and find a job,\" he says. \"Critical thinking is key. They need analytical skills, to be able to come up with solutions.\" The education department is working with the country's <a href=\"http://www.rdb.rw/departments/human-capital-and-institutional-development/sector-skills-councils.html\" title=\"\">sector skills councils</a> to address the skills gap.</p><p>\"The tourism and hospitality sector is a key driver for our economic development, for example,\" says Biruta. \"We ask them what kind of training they need to make sure graduates are suitable to work in that sector.\" A skills gap report highlighted that Rwanda also needs engineers, electricians and construction workers to further boost economic development, but Biruta is also focused on the role of technology in education.</p><p>The US nonprofits  <a href=\"http://one.laptop.org/\" title=\"\">One Laptop Per Child</a>' and <a href=\"http://www.innovationsforlearning.org/page/solutions/teachermate\" title=\"\">Innovations for Learning</a>, are both working in the country. Betweem 2007 and 2011 OLPC delivered 110,000 laptops to Rwandan children and teachers, while a <a href=\"https://edutechdebate.org/reading-skills-in-primary-schools/ole-rwanda-is-tripling-literacy-test-scores-with-teachermates/\" title=\"\">pilot study</a> of Innovations for Learning's TeacherMate programme tripled teachers' literacy test results.</p><p>To build on his nation's achievements to date, Biruta is keen to work with the development community to evaluate Rwanda's progress in education and to broaden access to technology in the country. \"We've done well in terms of access to education,\" he says. \"We need to put more effort in the quality of education but I'm sure we're going to achieve it if we work together.

Financing options can be quite complicated and for this project we gave seed funding and then purchased the emissions [in the form of voluntary carbon credits] for the first four years, which enabled the stoves to get on to the market.</p><p>We've since become involved in the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://climatecare.org/our-projects/lifestraw-carbon-for-water/\" title=\"\">LifeStraw [water filter] project</a> in the Busia region of Kenya, helping to provide 700,000 people with safe drinking water. With any project like this, it's essential to ensure that local communities are engaged in how to use these technologies. So there are local people who educate the villagers in how to use the LifeStraw filters properly. As part of this, they also gather and record data about usage patterns. They can then check that the technology is being used correctly, while also providing us with validated information about how many people are benefitting. In terms of our corporate communications, it's obviously important that this data is reliable.</p><p>This is quite a new field, so it's important when choosing a provider of offsets that they understand the market and have expert local knowledge. It's vital they have integrity too. This space is about collaboration and working in partnership with other organisations on the ground. That's quite a big difference from more conventional offsetting. It means offset providers need to build trust with agencies and others so that they can develop the right kind of relationships.</p><p><em>As told to Oliver Balch.</em></p><p><em>This content is brought to you by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business\">Guardian Sustainable Business</a> in association with ClimateCare.

Take cervical cancer as an example: due to pap testing, cervical cancer is rare in Canada or the US; however, <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/shining-a-light-on-developing-worlds-biggest-killer-non-communicable-diseases-12925\" title=\"\">it is the number one cause of cancer deaths in Kenyan women</a>. Prevention and screening has just not been available or accessible to most people in Kenya. Most cases are often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, which is partly due to inadequate healthcare infrastructure.</p><p>The issue is exacerbated further by a faulty national health insurance plan that doesn't allow patients to afford medical services. The health system is inadequately designed and resourced – particularly for people with cancer – with poorly equipped hospitals, a low doctor to patient ratio, and a lack of access to affordable drugs. <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/shining-a-light-on-developing-worlds-biggest-killer-non-communicable-diseases-12925\" title=\"\">These factors lead to late presentation, complications and meagre patient follow-up</a>.</p><p>Widespread lack of awareness and accurate information about cancer is another reason why screening is rare and many cancers are detected when it is too late to treat effectively. Several cultural myths exist regarding cancer, which are critical obstacles to expanded cancer control and care in Kenya, especially when it comes to early detection. One popular myth is that cancer is caused by curses from ancestors and elders. In such cases, people even believe that you can 'catch' the disease from those who have it.</p><p>Although developing countries bear 80% of the cancer burden, only about 5% of global resources devoted to cancer are found in these countries. Most cancer care services in Kenya are concentrated within a 5km radius of each other in Nairobi, making it difficult for most Kenyans to access necessary care. The public national hospital hosts most of Kenya's oncology expertise and technology. About 78% of Kenyans live in rural areas, which means that many patients requiring care may travel up to 600km to access cancer services and the wait time for treatment at Kenyatta National Hospital is extremely long.</p><h2>Action required to reduce barriers to cancer prevention and care</h2><p>Prevention efforts, both on a personal and policy level, must be scaled up for <a href=\"http://www.who.int/cancer/prevention/en/\" title=\"\">preventable cancers </a>such as cervical cancer.</p><p>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), like cancer and other chronic conditions, share common behavioural risk factors that must be reduced to facilitate disease prevention: physical inactivity, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diet. <a href=\"http://iom.edu/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Global/ControlChronicDiseases/Sess2Sp2Yonga.pdf\" title=\"\">Smoking and alcohol abuse are on the rise in Kenya, air pollution is potent in urban areas, schools do not prioritise physical activity, obesity is on the rise, and the list goes on</a>.</p><p>Reduction of these NCD risk factors is not addressed sufficiently by the ministry of health and other policymakers. Only 5% of the Kenyan budget is spent on health – instead of the recommended 15%, and <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/shining-a-light-on-developing-worlds-biggest-killer-non-communicable-diseases-12925\" title=\"\">much of the cost is on treatment rather than prevention</a>. Robust prevention policies will result not only in lives saved in the long term, but also in long-term economic gains.</p><h2>Progress is on the horizon</h2><p>In 2012, <a href=\"http:// http://www.ipcrc.net/pdfs/Kenya-National-Cancer-Control-strategy.pdf\" title=\"\">Kenya established a National Cancer Prevention and Control Act</a>, making it one of the few countries in Africa with legislation for cancer. The Act, which stipulates the establishment of a National Cancer Institute among other important advances to counter this disease in Kenya, has yet to become operational.</p><p>During a launch of 2013 breast cancer awareness and screening month, the Kenyan ministry of health called for revenue allocation for cancer control in the government budget. The presence of the first lady, Margaret Kenyatta, and other government officials at the cancer-screening launch ignited hope for high-level commitment in reducing the cancer burden. The first lady declared that she and President Uhuru Kenyatta had been screened for cancer, encouraging the public to follow suit – potentially lifting some of the public's stigmatisation of cancer.</p><p>Kenya is currently undergoing decentralisation of government functions, including healthcare, which means that there is a renewed opportunity to integrate cancer care into other regions of the country and build an overall healthier Kenya. As 47 counties of Kenya absorb the healthcare mandate, it is expected that greater community involvement will result in tailored healthcare for each region. Devolution will facilitate more straightforward avenues for advocacy on NCDs at the county-level, as the decision-makers in government will be more localised and have so far demonstrated themselves as easier to communicate with. County health policymakers are usually also native to the communities that they serve and have a more vested interest in improved health outcomes in their designated regions, than the previous national level decision-makers.</p><p>For both healthcare devolution and expanded care for cancer, there is a push to build private-public partnerships. Both public and private healthcare providers must have a seat at the policy table and work together, as multi-sectoral action will have the biggest impact within communities. Yet, the need to safeguard public health must be emphasised and the terms of such partnerships critically evaluated and monitored.</p><p><em>Jordan Jarvis is a global public health researcher based at the </em><a href=\"http://amref.org/\" title=\"\"><em>African Medical and Research Foundation</em></a><em>.

Any questions for me?","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-15T06:30:16Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/commentisfree/2014/jan/15/-work-deafblind-children-kenya-questions","fields":{"body":"<p>Edwin Osundwa is a passionate advocate for disabled rights in development. He is working with the Kenyan government to develop a curriculum for deafblind children. Edwin is visually impaired, giving him firsthand experience of the challenges children can face.</p> <p>Edwin will be online on <strong>Wednesday from 1pm-2.30pm GMT</strong> to answer your questions about his day job and the place of disability within development. What would you like to know? Post your questions in the comment thread below.</p> <p><strong>What’s a typical day for you?</strong><br />I start my day at 6am by catching up with the news. I work with the Kenyan department for education, so it is important that I’m up to date. I arrive at work at 8:30am where my first task is to read and respond to emails. From mid-morning, I handle all meetings, with government officials, parents or teachers. After lunch, I work on reports, strategies and campaign briefs. We are currently campaigning for the government of Kenya to immunise against rubella, which causes thousands of children to be born deafblind if their mothers catch it during pregnancy.</p> <p>Before the day is out I might meet with groups such as The Kenya Parents of Deafblind People Organisation. We supported families to set up this group, which has 345 members and spearheaded a campaign for the recognition of deafblind children’s education. I am also studying for a master’s degree in development management.</p> <p><strong>What is the most challenging aspect of your job?</strong><br />Every deafblind person that we support is different and meeting their needs can is a challenge. Being deafblind is not an absolute, some people have some sight or some hearing; others have none at all. Some people are born deafblind as a result of congenital rubella or birth complications, others lose their sight and hearing as result of accident or illness. Our programmes have to cater to this huge range.</p> <p><strong>How does your visual impairment affect you at work?</strong><br />It can be difficult when partners I’m working with aren’t aware of my visual impairment so don’t present information in an accessible way. Understanding how someone interprets a written document if they can’t see it is a real skill. However, it does give me firsthand experience of the challenges disabled people can face and the support the visually impaired or deafblind children might need.</p> <p><strong>Campaigners have said disabled people are being ignored by global development targets. Do you agree?</strong><br />There are 1 billion disabled people in the world and 80% live in developing countries. Disabled people also tend to be some of the poorest and least socially mobile. They need specialist support. Yet DfID currently has no dedicated policy for people with disabilities and millennium development goals don’t mention it at all.</p> <p>But things are changing. I gave evidence in the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/news/disability-and-development-1st-ev-session/\">first international development select committee inquiry into disability</a> and we are working to secure a place for disability in the future development goals. I am hopeful for a future where all disabled people will have the opportunity to benefit from international development.</p>  <h2><strong>Q&amp;A highlights:</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/30827524\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11748342\" title=\"View BlackberryBlossom’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2013/04/14/11748342/5e9da735-11cf-4283-b9dc-13fa05525313/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for BlackberryBlossom\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11748342\" title=\"View BlackberryBlossom’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">BlackberryBlossom</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/30827524\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">15 January 2014 10:59am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>What type of educational work do you provide for deaf-blind children?

How do you communicate with someone who is deafblind? It varies greatly for person to person but here are a few ways:<br />Where a child has no communication, they might be helped to learn some simple hand signs at first (for 'food’ for example)<br />They might also learn to use an 'object of reference’ to communicate. For example, if they hold out a mug this means that they want a drink<br />The people around the deafblind child can learn, though observation, to understand their body language and what they seem to want to communicate<br />Some people may be able to learn a more advanced form of sign language. In Bangladesh for example, people have been learning Bangla sign language, which is an adaption of the country’s sign language for deaf and deafblind people.<br />Those that have residual vision can learn ordinary sign language.<br />Technology also has the potential to help people communicate. For example, someone who has learned to read Braille can access the internet via a Braille keyboard<br />Recently in Kenya we have established a deafblind curriculum to help ensure that what is being taught in schools meets a certain standard and is uniform.

Watson cites studies arguing that claims of very rapid urbanisation may be overstated and rates may be higher in smaller towns. The Africa Development Bank defines the middle class as those spending $2-20 a day, and the upper middle class as spending $10-20 a day.</p><p>\"It is difficult to imagine how households with such minimal spending power can afford the luxury apartments portrayed in the fantasy plans (as well as the vehicles needed to move around these new cities), and it may be that prospective property developers are seriously misreading the African market,\" she writes.</p><p>As an example of an architectural white elephant, Watson cites the Chinese-built <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18646243\" title=\"\">\"ghost towns\"</a> outside the Angolan capital, Luanda – cities comprising of tower blocks of apartments selling at $150,000 to $200,000 each. Ambitious urban projects may have worked in Shanghai, China and Ho Chi Minh City, and cities such as Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore are clearly the models for the new African cities.</p><p>But Watson doubts whether African governments have the capacity to pull them off. On a mundane level, she wonders how cities, invariably described as smart and sustainable and consisting of tower blocks reliant on lifts and air conditioning, can function in an environment where power cuts occur several times a day.</p><p>\"Maybe they will be able to, but what nobody can tell me is what will happen to the people living in shack settlements in those cities,\" Watson says.</p><p>Satellite cities are frequently justified on the basis that they are located on empty land. But it is rare, she argues, for larger cities to be empty, and if such land is not within an environmentally protected area, then it is likely to be actively farmed.</p><p>\"In all kinds of eviction processes, landowners rarely hold land title, and full compensation for land, shelter and livelihoods is unlikely,\" she adds.</p><p>The desire to construct fantasy cities is bound to divert scarce resources from meeting the basic services and housing needs of the much larger poor urban populations. \"What seems most likely is that the majority of urban populations will find themselves further disadvantaged and marginalised,\" writes Watson. \"It is access to land by the urban poor (as well as those on the urban periphery and beyond) that is most directly threatened by these processes, and access to land in turn determines to urban services, to livelihoods and citizenship.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2014/1/10/1389367458044/MDG--Africa-Ghost-Towns---003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/jan/13/ghana-hope-city-african-white-elephant-projects","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/jan/13/ghana-hope-city-african-white-elephant-projects","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Global warming and energy – interwined problems in Africa | John Abraham","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-12T07:00:00Z","sectionId":"environment","id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/12/global-warming-energy-intertwined-africa","fields":{"body":"<p>Much of my work involves the design and installation of clean and robust energy sources in remote parts of the world.  On a recent trip to Kenya, my family had the opportunity to tour the Lake Naivasha region in Kenya.  This region contains a treasure of wildlife and was a filming location for the movie \"<em>Out of Africa</em>.\"  During a boat ride, we witnessed the impacts on climate change – not through academic journal articles or conference presentations – but through people who see climate change with their own eyes.  </p><p>In past years, Lake Naivasha had seen dramatic reductions in water level.  The coastline had changed and plants and animals had adapted to a new normal.  Recently, however, extreme rains have raised the waters approximately 4 meters according to our guide.  The new waterline had submerged and killed beautiful Acacia trees.  After conversations with many other Kenyans, it was apparent that the reliable wet-dry weather patterns had become more erratic; you didn't have to witness dying Acacia trees when farmers throughout the country told similar tales. Extreme weather swings were evident here before our eyes.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-426717364'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389311005582/photo450.JPG' alt='Flooding in Western Kenya, submerged buildings and Acacia trees.' width='450' height='302' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Flooding in Western Kenya, submerged buildings and Acacia trees.</figcaption></figure><p>Kenyan culture (and much of Africa) is deeply rooted in the patterns of weather and climate; much of their economy depends on agricultural production. That dependency has given them much clearer foresight than others about how to plan for the changed future.</p><p>The entirety of Kenya has awakened to the threats of climate change, including the government, agricultural sectors, energy industries and the educational system.  My journey to learn more about Kenya's plans brought me to the beautiful and large <a href=\"http://www.ku.ac.ke/\">Kenyatta University</a> campus, just northeast of Nairobi.  There, very new and quickly growing programs in <a href=\"http://www.ku.ac.ke/schools/engineering/departments/mechanical-and-manufacturing-engineering\">mechanical engineering</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ku.ac.ke/schools/engineering/departments/energy\">energy and sustainability</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ku.ac.ke/schools/agriculture/\">agricultural engineering</a> are just a few of the programs training tomorrow's technology leaders to make an impact solving today's problems.</p><p>Among the many initiatives are goals to provide clean, renewable, and robust energy for the campus and the country.  Some applications they are focusing on are wind-powered water-pumping systems.  The plan is to design, manufacture, install, and service small-scale wind power systems that slowly pump water into elevated storage tanks throughout the day and night.  Students, faculty, and staff draw the water is drawn down, typically during morning and evening hours.  The prototype wind turbine will be adapted to manufacturing techniques used locally, near the university.  It is hoped that wide-scale testing of the wind turbine system will occur over the next three years and thereafter, fast market penetration throughout Africa will be inevitable.</p><p>Another emerging technology coming from Kenyatta is the use of novel technologies for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC).  By using thermochemical sorption technologies, sometimes with solar heating, <a href=\"http://www.ku.ac.ke/schools/engineering/faculty/profile/97-school-faculty-profiles/225-dr-jeremiah-k-kiplagat\">Dr. Jeremiah Kiplagat</a> (recent recipient of the African Education Leadership Outstanding Professor Award) and his colleagues are setting the framework for improving the performance of refrigeration systems using these methodologies.   </p><p>As a third example, a series of faculty-led student projects have been completed to develop solar concentrating and tracking systems for heat generation and photovoltaic power generation.  The research teams have developed effective and simple means of moving reflecting mirrors and parabolic concentrators with the sun throughout the day to increase the amount of absorbed solar energy and increase the efficiency of the overall system. </p><p>While the faculty and staff are at the forefront in technology development projects such as these, much credit must be given to the administration.  With implementation of new degrees such as doctoral programs in sustainability and masters programs in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, engineering hydrology, and biomedical engineering, with a focus on solving the energy and health problems that are prevalent in the East African region, this university, and the country as a whole are destined to remain leaders in their geographical region.</p><p>It is clear from formal academic studies and from anecdotal evidence that developing countries that rely upon agriculture will suffer greatly from climate change in the coming decades.  It is hence apparent that the solutions to climate change, such as accelerated implementation of clean and renewable power, must be implemented with great wisdom so that people in these regions are able to access the same low-cost electricity that other nations have enjoyed.  In this regard, the climate-energy problem is often thought of as a double-edged sword – solutions to the climate problem make access to low-cost electricity more difficult. </p><p>Currently, the major source of energy in Kenya is hydropower. This is why the School of Engineering at Kenyatta University has also partnered with regional and international organizations to promote climate mitigation in water and energy sectors.  An example is the research being carried out by <a href=\"http://www.ku.ac.ke/schools/engineering/faculty/profile?id=219\">Dr. Luke Olang</a> in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.icpac.net/\">IGAD climate center</a> on developing a drought-monitoring tool for the greater horn of Africa in general.  The same research team is also actively involved in water management strategies in the vulnerable Mara River Basin, considered a World Heritage site due to the Great Annual Wildebeest Migration. </p><p>What Kenyatta University is showing the world is that it is possible to solve both the energy and the climate problems together.  Novel energy solutions using locally available technology and manufacturing techniques can build economies, provide low-cost energy, and preserve the future climate for our children.  This type of systematic planning and dedication gives me hope that our future climate and energy problems can be solved.</p><p>Perhaps the vision is best expressed by Prof. Chris Shisanya, Dean School of Humanities and Social Sciences who told me, </p><blockquote><p>\"We at Kenyatta University have decided to prepare our students early enough during their study programmes to confront the challenges posed by climate change.  We are now offering such courses as MSc. (Integrated Watershed Management) and MSc. (Climate Change and Sustainable Development), whose main focus is on adaptation to climate change.  We believe that by exposing our students to such knowledge, they will be better equipped to help communities in Kenya's rural landscapes enhance their resilience to climate change impacts.\"</p></blockquote>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/5/25/1337937596242/Kenya-drought--004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/12/global-warming-energy-intertwined-africa","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/12/global-warming-energy-intertwined-africa","sectionName":"Environment"},{"webTitle":"Guardian Christmas appeal raises almost £200,000","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-10T18:24:10Z","sectionId":"society","id":"society/2014/jan/10/guardian-christmas-appeal-response-readers","fields":{"body":"<p>Generous readers have so far raised nearly £200,000 for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/christmas-charity-appeal-2013\" title=\"\">Guardian's Christmas appeal</a>, guaranteeing a massive financial boost for four charities working on innovative social projects in Africa.</p><p>With a week to go until the appeal closes, the cash total donated stands at £182,000.

But Inglis said that would not necessarily mean the end of the program, provided any dataset held outside of NSA had “sufficient depth” and “sufficient breadth” over “the whole haystack” of call records going back for years, and provided “sufficient agility” to the NSA to search it.</p> <p>That is the subject of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/08/obama-decision-nsa-reforms-surveillance\">a heated dispute between the NSA and privacy advocates</a> at the White House this week. Civil libertarian groups want to ensure that the legal standards for NSA to access phone records are heightened to prevent Americans not suspected of wrongdoing from being caught in surveillance dragnets, and that companies are not required to store data for longer than the 18-month average maximum in the industry.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, a coalition of civil liberties groups met the White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler. Michelle Richardson of the American Civil Liberties Union, who was at the meeting, said the coalition’s main message to the White House was to end bulk domestic phone collection, rather than repackage it. </p> <p>“Bulk collection is the big one, that’s the big question: whether you continue to spy on Americans or not,” Richardson said after the meeting. “You have to resolve that. That’s all people will remember.”</p> <p>Inglis was bolstered on Thursday by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/jul/30/fbi-director-james-comey\">the new FBI director James Comey</a>, who said he opposed curbing the bureau’s power to collect information from businesses through a non-judicial subpoena called a national security letter. The use of national security letters, which occurs in secret, came under sharp criticism from Obama’s surveillance review panel, which advocated judicial approval over them.</p> <p>Comey told reporters that would make it harder for his agency to investigate national security issues than conduct bank fraud investigations.</p> <p>Surveillance skeptics who left meetings at the White House this week said they believe deliberations are still ongoing internally about how far back to scale US surveillance. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who sits on the Senate intelligence committee, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/09/nsa-privacy-advocates-obama-end-data-collection\">told the Guardian on Thursday</a> the “debate is clearly fluid”.</p> <p>On Friday, Wyden and two intelligence committee colleagues, the Democrats Mark Udall and Martin Heinrich,<a href=\"ttp://www.scribd.com/doc/197940233/Udall-Wyden-Heinrich-Press-White-House-to-Make-Common-Sense-Constitutional-Reforms-to-NSA-Surveillance-Protect-Privacy\"> released a letter to Obama</a> in which they urged him to definitively end bulk surveillance on domestic phone data.</p> <p>“While it might be more convenient for the NSA to collect phone records in bulk rather than directing individual queries to the various phone companies, convenience alone does not justify the collection of the personal information of millions of ordinary, innocent Americans, especially when the same or more information can be obtained in a timely manner using less intrusive methods,” the three senators wrote.</p> <p>Obama’s White House staff were meeting representatives of tech firms on Friday, concluding a packed week packed of meetings with surveillance stakeholders.</p> <p>Even as Inglis, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/nsa-deputy-director-john-inglis-retire\">who will soon retire</a>, argued against the restriction of his agency’s powers, he said the burden will be on the NSA to be more forthcoming about what its activities actually are. </p> <p>“We have to actually kind of be more transparent going forward, so the American public understands what we do, why we do it, how we do it,” he told NPR.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/18/1374176736784/John-Inglis-NSA-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/10/nsa-mass-surveillance-powers-john-inglis-npr","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jan/10/nsa-mass-surveillance-powers-john-inglis-npr","sectionName":"US news"},{"webTitle":"10 app trends for 2014: privacy, wearables, education and more","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-10T17:09:54Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2014/jan/10/app-trends-2014-privacy-wearables-education","fields":{"body":"<p>At the end of 2013, there were more than one million apps apiece in the respective stores of Apple and Google, with both stores well over the 50bn downloads mark.</p> <p>Apps have made their presence felt across a swathe of industries: from entertainment, publishing and games through to the enterprise and education sectors.</p> <p>Apps have attracted big investments, generated lucrative acquisitions and made billions of dollars in revenues, yet they’ve also sparked debate around privacy, regulation and the question of whether they are fuelling another dotcom-style bubble that’s destined to pop.</p> <p>And so to 2014. What will be the big trends around apps and the developers, startups and brands that are making and releasing them? Here are a few thoughts.</p> <h2>1. An apps crash is coming (but that’s a good thing)</h2> <p>Apple’s recently-released figures for 2013 sounded good: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/07/apple-reveals-iphone-and-ipad-owners-spent-10bn-on-apps-in-2013\">$8bn paid out to iOS developers</a> over the year. But with a million apps, that’s an average of around $8k per app. A relatively small number of apps are making big money, and a lot of apps are making diddly-squat. Which isn’t necessarily a problem: many of them are a.) rubbish and b.) spare time or hobbyist projects.</p> <p>In the middle, though, that’s where a crash is coming: for example startups that raised seed and/or venture financing but didn’t catch on, or which managed to find some users but are struggling to make money from them. Photo-sharing apps, health-tracking tools, freemium games, messaging apps… wherever there’s an overstuffed category, there’s going to be a cull in 2014.</p> <p>This, all things considered, is a good thing. This year feels like a survival-of-the-fittest moment, although that hopefully means some of the people who failed will come back with new ideas, wiser for the lessons learned first time round.</p> <p>But if 2012 and 2013 saw lots of app startups “pivot” in search of an audience and business model, 2014 will see many run out of money with no more turning to be done. On the bright side, those with good technology will find willing “acquihirers” in the likes of Facebook, Google, Apple and others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a01b3247-aded-4d48-9182-04dec10d23e5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/11/1378904926879/best-android-apps-for-kids-2013.jpg\" alt=\"Android will get more apps day-and-date with iOS in 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Android will get more apps day-and-date with iOS in 2014.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2. iOS and Android still front-of-mind for developers</h2> <p>Crashing bores can vent for hours online why iOS is better than Android, or vice versa. The truth is that most serious app developers now come to market with a strategy encompassing both. iOS is still generating more revenues for developers, but Android has massive reach – depending on the specifics of your business and the parts of the world you’re targeting, they deserve equal priority.</p> <p>Does that mean releasing new apps on both platforms simultaneously? Not always. Over 2013, a lot more apps did debut day-and-date across iOS and Android, but smaller app startups in particular still regularly launch, iterate and polish on iOS before porting to Android. The difference is they’ll have firm plans for that porting process from the start, which didn’t used to be the case.</p> <p>Expect to see even the most iOS-focused app categories putting more emphasis on Android. Children’s apps are a good example: until recently, developers of kids’ apps didn’t see a viable market on Android, but strong sales of Android tablets (I’d say four in five parents I know who bought a tablet for their children this Christmas opted for a Kindle Fire or a Tesco Hudl, for example) are helping to change that.</p> <p>Beyond iOS and Android? Microsoft has done a pretty good job of identifying the most popular apps that are still lacking on Windows Phone, then chasing them down. The gap between apps breaking big on rivals and appearing on Windows Phone can still be frustrating for owners – no Clash of Clans, QuizUp or Candy Crush Saga yet, to name but three of 2013’s biggest games. Microsoft (including Nokia, soon) will need to keep up its efforts.</p> <h2>3. Privacy as a priority</h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/03/phone-hacks-snapchat-breaks-silence\">recent Snapchat hack</a> – and the subsequent arguments over whether the company did enough to apologise to users for it – has sharpened the debate around apps and privacy. As have the ongoing revelations about intelligence agencies’ electronic surveillance, and a growing realisation beyond the technology community that free online services (whether mobile or not) are ultimately selling something to somebody – and if you’re not paying, it’s probably your data.</p> <p>This already feels a bit old to geeks like me, but the point is that this realisation is crossing over to the hundreds of millions of normal people who now own smartphones and use apps like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, Skype, MyFitnessPal and any number of Google services. When apps play fast and loose with privacy, and/or get hacked, the collective freakout will travel faster and further than ever.</p> <p>This should have some beneficial effects. First, it puts more pressure on developers of a whizzy new app to make privacy a priority right from the start. Second, it should spur us journalists to ask more searching questions about this from the very first time we encounter these companies. Yes yes, amazeballs user interface and disruptotastic business model, but what’s your privacy policy, who are you sharing data with, what are your plans when a hack attack comes (as it will), and so on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-bfcb357f-85b1-4495-b605-744ec1f1ebda\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/26/1372253403820/candy-crush-saga.jpg\" alt=\"Hardcore gamers don't like Candy Crush Saga, but their mums do.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hardcore gamers don't like Candy Crush Saga, but their mums do.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>4. A more constructive debate around free-to-play gaming</h2> <p>People who comment on online articles about mobile free-to-play gaming hate it. F2P is evil, it’s killing gaming, and the developers who make freemium games are intent on producing soulless, cynical, cash-grabbing software that relies on players being too stupid to realise they’re being milked.</p> <p>Meanwhile, these commenters’ mums, their dads, their aunts, uncles, cousins and “non-gamer” friends are playing F2P games by the bucketload – and loving the experience. They don’t tend to comment on online articles about these games: they’re too busy nailing level 172 of Candy Crush Saga.</p> <p>I don’t expect the angry comments to abate any time soon, but I think the debate could be more constructive in 2014. Why are some freemium games soulless and cynical, and others not? Let’s call out the former, and celebrate the latter, so that developers can learn the lessons of both and make better games. Less“Freemium is evil”, and more “Here’s how freemium can be not evil”.</p> <p>That will require some evolution in accepted ways to make money from free games. Timers, for example. If your game’s business model even partially relies on stopping me playing it, rather than from making me love it, you’ve failed creatively. 2013 provided masses of data on how different “monetisation” (ugh!) methods work, but 2014 will be the year when that data informs more great games, rather than dominates mediocre ones.</p> <h2>5. Messaging apps spread their wings</h2> <p>The rapid growth of messaging apps, from WeChat, Line and KakaoTalk in the East to WhatsApp, Kik, Snapchat (again) and the deBlackBerryfied BBM was one of the big mobile stories of 2013, providing the background for much of the speculation about whether teenagers were set to flee Facebook, just as their parents had fled Myspace before them.</p> <p>2014 should give us a firm answer on the latter trend – my instinct is that teens aren’t quitting Facebook, it’s just that they’re making a clear division between that social network for communication with their families, and others to communicate with their friends – but it will also emphasise that most messaging apps are about much more than messaging.</p> <p>Games, shopping, music and video and broader social networking features are the obvious first directions that these apps are already heading in. Working more with brands is going to be a key trend in 2014 though: brands and agencies will come flocking in an attempt to reach people who are no longer as engaged with Facebook, but it’s not yet obvious how they can best fit in without seeming intrusive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-bc9da84c-e149-4efc-abf1-3759f3abd820\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/10/1389373150648/d81beb66-d7bd-4b8b-bde0-ca8869572820-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Google Glass, huh?

Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. New platforms, new gimmicks. But then what?</h2> <p>Smart watches! Google Glass! Connected cars! Fridges! The rise of wearables, in-car app platforms and the Internet of Things means pretty much every whizzy startup is thinking about how to put their apps on devices other than smartphones and tablets. In many cases, it’s about the (undeniably-interesting) technological challenge of doing it, rather than a firm sense of why it should be done.</p> <p>“Company X launches app for Wearable Device Y” is going to be a particularly-recurring headline in 2014, and that’ll be about all they’re good for: headlines. A lot of these apps’ main function will be to shift notifications from your smartphone to your wrist or eyes. That’s not really interesting.</p> <p>But behind that first wave will come the good stuff: apps made for the people and their behaviour, rather than just for the hardware. What might normal people (i.e. nobody who’s got one yet) want from Glass-style augmented eyewear? What do normal people (i.e. nobody who’s got one yet) want a smart watch to do?</p> <p>Those answers may not come until 2015, but there are steps that can be taken in 2014. Forget the regular speculation over whether Google Glass will go on sale this year. I’d rather see Google recruit hundreds of new Glass Explorers in India, Brazil, China, Kenya, Russia… A much fuller spread of nationalities, races, professions, ages, financial situations.</p> <p><em>Then</em> we’ll know more about what kind of apps to make for that kind of device.</p> <h2>7. Education, education, education</h2> <p>2014 feels like a big year for apps – and by extension tablets – in education. Initiatives are already well underway around the world to get tablets into classrooms, from affordable Android devices in India to iPads in California. Yes, a growing number of children have access to them at home, but schools will be key in ensuring those that don’t aren’t left on the other side of a new digital divide.</p> <p>So what will schools put on these tablets? It feels like a big moment for developers making educational apps and services to redouble their efforts, in the knowledge that there will be a market for their products. Which raises all kinds of interesting questions about how education authorities, schools and individual teachers decide what apps to use, and how they dovetail with the existing curriculum.</p> <p>Actually, though, there’s something else to think about: children making apps, not just using them. Kids are learning to code all over the world, with different schemes and tools. In 2013, there were regular novelty stories about 13 year-olds who’d made their first app. In 2014, we’ll lay off the patronising novelty aspect, and start thinking about the real, exciting implications of the Minecraft generation crafting with code as well as with blocks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-37951913-58c1-43b9-bbbc-68d5cdb8b96c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/10/1389373423035/18c3570c-81f8-4daf-990c-842130f77e0a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Meet the new office, but what apps will help you work in it?\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meet the new office, but what apps will help you work in it? Photograph: Lewis Whyld/PA Archive/PA Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8. Step into my office</h2> <p>Many of the most innovative apps in 2014 will only be used by a few hundred or thousand people. That’s because they’ll be developed by companies for their staff to use: enterprise apps. They don’t tend to get much press – partly because they’re not publicised, but also because we journalists find it easier to get to grips with consumer apps.</p> <p>But in terms of resources and innovation, the B2B apps field is where a lot of the most interesting work is currently going on, including solving some of the problems (security in particular) that consumer apps are only just realising is a harder challenge than they’d realised.</p> <p>Apps aren’t a lone actor here: they’re part of wider trends around remote working and collaboration that really are (and sorry, it’s a cliché) changing the way people and companies do business. Watch closely for the rising numbers of tablets (Apple, Android and Windows alike) making their way into workplaces, and then think about the software that’s being developed for them that will never appear on an app store.</p> <h2>9. Disruption versus regulation</h2> <p>Disruptive app innovation? Yay! Regulation and stuck-in-the-mud industries? Boo! That was the tone of the debate at many a tech conference in 2013 as Uber, Airbnb and others chafed at the barriers put in their way by city authorities and regulators. Why shouldn’t people be able to rent out their spare room to strangers or use their smartphone to book a ride from a non-taxi car?</p> <p>The leading lights of the “sharing economy” pride themselves on their companies’ disruptive qualities, but the debate around this can often feel like an “are you with us or against us?” situation. Criticise these startups, and you&apos;re <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/aug/05/sharing-economy-uber-lyft-peers\">part of the entrenched interests of the old economy</a>.</p> <p>We’ll see more of this in 2014. Sometimes it’ll be cities slapping silly penalties on sharing-economy startups, like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/28/uber-lecab-and-others-now-have-to-wait-15-minutes-before-picking-you-up-in-france/\">Uber drivers having to wait for 15 minutes before picking up a passenger in France</a>. But sometimes there will be legitimate debates about the way these companies manage their businesses, and the responsibilities they take – for example the recent <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/02/should-car-services-provide-insurance-whenever-their-driver-app-is-open/\">debate about a fatal road accident involving an Uber driver</a>.</p> <p>People are evangelical about sharing-economy startups and their apps, for good reason. Even so, 2014 will be a year to tackle the outdated legislation and anti-competitive behaviour that prevents these companies getting a fair shot, while also remembering that regulation itself has an important purpose in protecting people on both sides of the transactions fuelled by the sharing economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a987e83c-77c3-4709-ab3d-cd2a9908459a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/10/1389373539791/1186ad81-0c65-4744-83ed-200b2e7c1022-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Look up, not down!\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Look up, not down! Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>10. Time to think about putting down the device?</h2> <p>In December 2012, my son was in his school nativity play. I rushed up at the end, proud as punch, and started taking photos – Facebook and Instagram in mind. Then I noticed that he was much moister-eyed than usual. Being in the play had been a bit overwhelming, and what he wanted was a cuddle, not his own personal paparazzo.</p> <p>I was ashamed. In December 2013, when the situation repeated itself, I rushed up and gave him a cuddle. The photos came later. But that moment a year before was a proper, much-needed slap in the face about priorities. And here’s a hunch: more people will experience some kind of personal moment of truth like this in 2014.</p> <p>It might be couples realising that they sit on the sofa every evening cycling through social networks on their smart devices rather than talking to one another. It might be people realising they’ve stopped reading books in bed in favour of checking smartphones. It might be realising that a forest is amazing because it’s a <em>forest</em>, and not rubbish because you can’t check email over GPRS.</p> <p>Anecdotally, I hear more friends talking about making an effort to rein in their device usage in 2014, making space for conversation, cuddles, culture… life! This may still be a middle-class problem, yes. But if it’s a wider trend, I wonder if it will also reward developers whose apps are more sensitive to these desires – or even help us fulfil them.</p> <p>This may be wishful thinking, but I’m an optimist. The most innovative apps in 2014 might just be the ones that help us to put our devices away a little more often.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/10/1389372475187/a05fb4d5-d14c-4c1c-82f7-60c708eff651-140x84.jpeg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/10/app-trends-2014-privacy-wearables-education","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2014/jan/10/app-trends-2014-privacy-wearables-education","sectionName":"Technology"},{"webTitle":"Weekly roundup: Social Enterprise Network: 10 January 2014","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-10T15:45:00Z","sectionId":"guardian-professional","id":"social-enterprise-network/2014/jan/10/weekly-news-social-enterprise-divine-chocolate","fields":{"body":"<p>Hello, good afternoon and welcome to the Guardian Social Enterprise Network's news of the week.

It was predicted that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22464368\" title=\"\">mobile phones would outnumber people by 2014</a>, with low-cost smartphones opening up opportunities for even more people to get connected. And the <a href=\"http://www.worldwewant2015.org/\" title=\"\">UN turned to the internet</a> to canvass opinion on what should replace the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">millennium development goals</a>.</p><p></p><p>In August, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he aimed to get every person on the planet online. He then launched <a href=\"http://internet.org/\" title=\"\">internet.org</a>, along with a 10-page document entitled <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/isconnectivityahumanright/isconnectivityahumanright.pdf\" title=\"\">Connectivity is a Human Right</a> that outlines his vision of the future.</p><p></p><p>This followed the 2010 launch of Facebook Zero, a text-only version of the site with no data charges. In the <a href=\"http://qz.com/5180/facebooks-plan-to-find-its-next-billion-users-convince-them-the-internet-and-facebook-are-the-same/\" title=\"\">18 months since its launch, Facebook users in Africa increased by 114%</a>. The business benefits for the popular social-networking site are obvious, but Zuckerberg believes a better-connected world is better for local economies, too.</p><p></p><p>Next came Twitter, which in December <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/10/twitter-myriad-partnership-increasing-userbase-emerging-markets)\" title=\"\">signed a deal with a Swiss mobile company to enable cheap access</a> to users of phones with basic features or on low-cost plans.</p><p></p><p>Wikipedia also got in on the act. Its foundation, Wikimedia, has a clear mission: to create a world \"in which every single human being can freely share the sum of all knowledge''. Last year the company launched Wikipedia Zero, a flagship programme that partners with mobile phone providers to let people browse with no data charges. As with Facebook, the term \"zero\" signifies free data.</p><p></p><p>In October, Wikipedia joined forces with Airtel to provide <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/10/24/airtel-wikipedia-zero-text-trial/#more-25967\" title=\"\">Wikipedia Zero by SMS for the first time in Kenya</a>.  Users can text *515# to receive an invite to search Wikipedia; they are then sent the information requested a paragraph at a time. After a three-month trial they hope to expand the service. Wikimedia hopes to reach 1 billion people by 2015.</p><p></p><p>The most recent <a href=\"http://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/11/07/wikipedia-zero/\" title=\"\">partnership announced by Wikipedia is in Burma</a>, which has a 10% mobile phone penetration rate, one of the lowest in the world.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://beta.groundsourcing.com/\" title=\"\">Groundsource</a> is testing a new platform to ensure that communities that are not online are able to get their voices heard. The platform, which works on feature phones, hopes to bring people together over shared concerns and connect them with journalists.</p><p></p><p>In India there are an estimated 200m internet users, but only 30% are women. <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/google-india-aims-to-bring-50-million-women-online-448825\" title=\"\">Google hopes to change this by helping 50 million women go digital over the year</a>. It's <a href=\"http://www.hwgo.com\" title=\"\">helping women get online</a> website gives a step-by-step guide to the internet, from computer basics to language preferences. Mothers are targeted by \"inspirational\" quotes such as \"internet moms connect well with their kids\" and \"internet moms make meals fun\". The company has also set up a toll-free helpline and partnered with companies to raise awareness of the initiative offline.</p><p></p><p>There are also innovations such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/ushahidi-brk-modem-africa\" title=\"\">BRCK, a low-cost modem, designed for Africa</a>, that can switch between ethernet, Wi-Fi and 3G/4G connection. Its backup battery means it can last for eight hours off grid.</p><p></p><p>So are we going to see a dramatic increase in the number of people getting online in developing countries over the next few years? How can people overcome the barriers of high charges, low network coverage, a lack of reliable electricity and restrictions to information due to laws enforced by their governments?</p><p></p><p>We want to hear from you. Do you agree with Zuckerberg's view that connectivity is a human right? Will his initiative have an impact on your life, or do you see it as simply a marketing strategy by global tech companies?</p><p></p><p>How does your internet behaviour differ from five years ago?

Forbes <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2013/05/28/why-google-and-facebook-cofounder-chris-hughes-are-giving-cash-directly-to-the-poorest/\" title=\"\">has dubbed its approach radical,</a> while the Economist said it's as <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/international/21588385-giving-money-directly-poor-people-works-surprisingly-well-it-cannot-deal\" title=\"\">extraordinary as \"throwing money out of helicopters\".</a></p><p></p><p>But what's so new or innovative about giving poor people money? Cash-transfer schemes are estimated to reach up to a billion people in developing countries. A <a href=\"http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/PDF/Articles/cash-transfers-literature-review.pdf\" title=\"\">2011 paper from the UK Department for International Development</a> said a \"quiet revolution\" over the past 15 years has seen such initiatives move \"from the margins of development policy towards the mainstream\".</p><p></p><p>What GiveDirectly has done is to capitalise on the remarkable rise of mobile phone use in developing countries – and the growth of mobile money-transfer systems such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/mar/20/kenya.mobilephones\" title=\"\">M-Pesa in Kenya</a> – to give individual donors the ability to participate in such schemes too.</p><p></p><p>But it is more than that. Many of the largest and best-known cash-transfer schemes attach conditions to the money people receive. In the case of Brazil's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/dec/17/brazil-bolsa-familia-decade-anniversary-poverty-relief\" title=\"\"><em>bolsa familia</em></a>, which is a decade old this year, cash is paid on the condition that children go to school and get vaccinated. GiveDirectly attaches no conditions – its recipients can spend the money in any way they want.</p><p></p><p>\"People think this is radical and weird, but actually it is all the things we think of as conventional that haven't been tested,\" says Niehaus, who is uncomfortable about some of the attention GiveDirectly has received in this respect. Poor people, he says, know better than anyone what they need, and assumptions that they will waste the money they receive are not backed up by evidence.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/joha/www/publications/Haushofer_Shapiro_Policy_Brief_UCT_2013.10.22.pdf\" title=\"\">An evaluation by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> this year found recipients spent the cash on things such as food and healthcare, to replace thatched roofs with metal ones, buy livestock and invest in small businesses. It also found evidence to suggest the money reduced hunger and increased psychological wellbeing.</p><p></p><p>The charity's no-strings approach, it's minimalistic website, and even its name, give the impression that it heralds the end of the middleman. But underneath, there are lots of moving parts. Recipients are identified, for example, using a combination of census data, satellite imagery and door-to-door visits looking for homes with thatched roofs – which the charity uses as an \"objective indicator\" of poverty. Far from wanting GiveDirectly to disappear once it has proved its point, Niehaus thinks it can help other NGOs, and even governments, to implement their cash-transfer schemes. \"Right now, people think we're interesting and innovative, but in the future I think we'll be known because we do this well,\" he says.</p><p></p><p>However, not everyone is convinced. Some point out the obvious: you can't use cash transfers to buy food or textbooks if they're not on sale. Others argue that such schemes do not directly tackle structural issues underpinning poverty and inequality. Indian economist Jayati Ghosh warns that \"the current tendency is to see this as a further excuse for the reduction of publicly provided services, and replace them with the administratively easier option of doling out money\". The debate about whether conditions should be attached continues, and the answer is probably: \"it depends\".</p><p></p><p>For its part, GiveDirectly avoids casting cash transfers as a panacea. Instead it argues they should be the benchmark against which charities evaluate their work: groups that ask for money on behalf of the poor should be able to prove they can do more good with it than the poor themselves. At a time of budget pressures and concern about just how big and expensive some NGOs have become, it's no wonder this is a compelling challenge.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/12/27/1388145909985/Kenyan-children-play-in-N-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/dec/31/charity-begins-phone-east-africa-givedirectly","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/dec/31/charity-begins-phone-east-africa-givedirectly","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"Tech 128: 2013 was the year of Moocs, OK Google - and NSA surveillance","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-27T08:01:00Z","sectionId":"technology","id":"technology/2013/dec/27/tech-128-2013-was-the-year-of-moocs-ok-google-and-nsa-surveillance","fields":{"body":"<p>In our series of everything that 2013 will be remembered for, we reach Moocs, the nest Nexus devices to date and one Edward Snowden.</p> <h2>Moocs</h2> <p>Arguably the most significant industry to be disrupted yet, many of the first world&apos;s most prestigious educational institutions are being prised open in the form of Moocs, or massively open online courses.

But only a tiny amount of that trickled down to where it is needed the most – to provide power to the two billion people without access to energy. The UN's goal of universal access to modern energy by 2030 will require an annual investment of up to $41bn a year. Progress to date has been slow, to say the least.</p><p>Over the past year, a new model has emerged which blends the crowdfunding entrepreneurship of <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" title=\"\">Kickstarter</a> with the social enterprise of <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org/\" title=\"\">Kiva</a>. Ryan Levinson conceived of <a href=\"http://sunfunder.com/\" title=\"\">SunFunder</a>, an off-grid solar finance company, during a trip to South East Asia after quitting his job at a US bank. During this trip he began to hear repeated stories about lack of access to capital to fund solar projects.</p><p>\"With my background in energy finance on US solar energy projects I could see how access to finance can really open up the market,\" he said. \"Financing is a challenge for the clean energy industry all over the world but there are regions without electricity that are best suited to distributed solar power. But who is going to finance this transformation of a market where 1.3 billion people have limited or no access to electricity?</p><p>\"I really believe that solar can leapfrog the grid over the next decade or two the same way cellphones were able to leapfrog landlines in developing countries. But it's going to require a lot of capital - we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars and there doesn't seem to be any company that specialises in this emerging sector.\"</p><p>In May 2011, Levinson left his job at <a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/\" title=\"\">Wells Fargo</a>, where he oversaw $500m in financing for commercial-sized projects in the US. A little over a year after SunFunder was founded in the summer of 2012, it has fully financed 10 projects in Uganda, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya and the Philippines. Some of the financing is small – between £4,000 and £25,000 – but the impact is often large.</p><p>Solar photovoltaic panel costs have reduced by 60% over the past two years, making PV technology more economically competitive than ever before, particularly in remote locations in the developing world that would never be reached by the grid or have to rely on diesel generation.</p><p>\"For the first time, solar energy can be affordable economically for people all over the world and often with no subsidies,\" said Levinson. \"That really struck me having worked in more developed markets where there is a large solar energy industry dependent on subsidies. This was an enormous opportunity to solve such a big problem – it seemed like a perfect time and I felt like my background lent itself well to creating a company dedicated to solving this problem.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, SunFunder announced a milestone with the full repayment within a year of its first loan for a <a href=\"http://www.sunnymoney.org/\" title=\"\">SunnyMoney</a> project in Zambia. But that milestone was not just significant for the San Francisco-based startup and the social enterprise division of London-based charity <a href=\"http://www.solar-aid.org/\" title=\"\">SolarAid</a>.</p><p>Levinson said that every project that crosses the 100% repayment line brings off-grid solar finance a step closer to bankability. Scale is one of the main objectives of SunFunder, which aims to invest $1bn by 2020. To reach those volumes, the involvement of large international finance institutions like the World Bank, government entities and foundations will be essential. The <a href=\"http://www.iea.org/\" title=\"\">International Energy Agency</a> estimates that <a href=\"http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energydevelopment/energyaccessprojectionsto2030/\" title=\"\">nearly $1tn</a>  in cumulative investment will be required to achieve universal energy access by 2030.</p><p>While rows continue over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/energy\" title=\"energy prices\">energy price hikes</a> in the UK, the proportion of a family's income spent on kerosene, candles, batteries and diesel generators in the developing world is much higher. In addition to the financial burden, the costs to human health are also high, with an estimated <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-help-girls-and-women-access-clean-energy\" title=\"\">two million deaths</a> a year associated with the burning of solid fuels indoors in unventilated kitchens. Women and children are most affected.</p><p>Though Levinson does not like to use the kerosene parity comparison, he acknowledges the financial burden on poor families. \"The point is that on both a per unit of energy basis and as a percentage of income, people pay way more for energy in off-grid communities, and often this is for very poor quality energy that brings a number of negative impacts,\" he said.</p><p>Solar systems even of a small size increase productivity levels for work and study, respiratory disorders often subside, while savings from the freedom from kerosene are significant. Increased connectivity through access to cellular phones and the internet is also a powerful tool to unlock economic growth and can only be achieved with stable supplies of electricity.</p><p>\"People often use kerosene as their primary source of light and at the same time you have 600 million people in the world with cellphones and no good way or affordable way of charging those cellphones,\" said Levinson. \"It's not just about access to electricity it's also about access to connectivity and information which in our world is increasingly important.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, SunFunder launched a new partnership with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fenixintl.com/\" title=\"\">Fenix International</a>, a Silicon Valley renewable energy company that designs and manufactures mobile phone charging systems for emerging markets. In March, SunFunder won the <a href=\"http://www.cleantech.com/2013/01/29/cleantech-group-facebook-present-cleantech-goes-social/\" title=\"\">Facebook Cleantech Goes Social</a> contest&nbsp;and a $25,000 prize to develop an app that will connect crowdfunding investors with end-users who benefit from solar projects. SunFunder will also launch social gift cards through Facebook's internet.org initiative, which aims to make the internet available to the two-thirds of the world population not yet connected.</p><p>So far, SunFunder has raised $150,000 from more than 590 people in 37 countries. Securities and Exchange Commission rules allow crowdfunders to participate outside the US but restrict returns to a \"dividend\" that is put back into an evergreen fund. SunFunder also recently closed an issuance of Solar Empowerment Notes that raised $250,000 from four accredited investors.</p><p>\"For us, it's about a diversity of sources of funding,\" said Levinson. \"Crowd funding has been great and it's a big part of who we are and we're going to stay committed to it. But we're also raising capital from private investors to fund projects and it's a big part of our strategy going forward. We wouldn't have been able to do that if we were not able to show through crowdfunding that this works. Crowdfunding is proving that this is a bankable sector. But we're not going to limit ourselves to the crowd.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387464340028/Southern-Sudans-Independe-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/crowdfunding-solar-power-bankable-sector","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/crowdfunding-solar-power-bankable-sector","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"Woolwich murder: what drove two men to kill a soldier in the street?","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-19T12:48:43Z","sectionId":"uk-news","id":"uk-news/2013/dec/19/woolwich-murder-soldier-street-adebolajo-radicalised-kenya","fields":{"body":"<p>As the nightmare first seconds of Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale's attack on Lee Rigby unfolded, there was a sign before them of how far they had strayed from their adopted religion.</p><p>They believed murdering a British soldier would please Allah and be a strike against the foreign policy of the west. They drove a car into Rigby, catapulting him on to the bonnet.</p><p>To the zealots, Rigby was an enemy they were about to behead. To Saraj Miah, a Muslim man who happened to be nearby and was wearing a white prayer cap as a sign of his devoutness, he was a human being in desperate trouble.</p><p>Miah had been smoking a cigarette outside a shop in Woolwich, south London, when he saw Adebolajo get out of his car with a cleaver in his hand and slash at the neck of a man on the ground, as Adebowale stabbed at the body. Miah was the first person to try to save Rigby, shouting \"don't kill him\" at the attackers. To ward Miah off, one aimed a gun at him, forcing him to back away.</p><p>How Adebolajo and Adebowale became radicalised to the point that they wanted to butcher a man in broad daylight did not form part of the court case. But it is the crucial issue facing the government, the counter-terrorism establishment and communities across Britain, an issue they have been grappling with since the modern age of terrorism began in the mass bloodshed of the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001.</p><p>Adebolajo and Adebowale are the first terrorists in Britain inspired by al-Qaida to plot murder, kill their victim and survive to answer questions. From a search for what drove them emerges a complex mix of a battle to control Islamic teaching, extremists in Britain and Africa, the internet, the attackers' personalities and how they interpret the modern world around them.</p><p>The story of Rigby's murderers shows that the ideology of violent jihad retains the power to capture young Britons and render them capable of savage acts of which they are proud.</p><p>After the murder Adebolajo and Adebowale did not attempt to flee but remained at the scene and tried to turn modern technology – smartphones with cameras – into a tool of propaganda. They posed for pictures before Adebolajo talked into cameras and justified the slaughter, his hands covered in blood from his victim.</p><p>Then Adebolajo, 29, and Adebowale, 22, rushed armed officers as they arrived, brandishing their knives and cleaver and an unloaded gun. They claimed they wanted the officers to shoot them dead and thus make them martyrs. They were shot and wounded, detained and taken to hospital. During police interviews and then before the jury that convicted him, Adebolajo said he had picked his target at random, viewed himself as a soldier and calculated the degree of suffering to inflict on his victim.</p><p>On his first day of police interviews, Adebolajo explained how he and Adebowale had driven to the barracks in Woolwich in a Vauxhall Tigra on 22 May. The day before he had bought knives from an Argos store and a knife sharpener. Adebolajo told detectives they were determined to stun and then murder a soldier – any soldier – because he was \"the most fair target because he joins the army with kind of an understanding that your life is at risk\".</p><p>He added that they attacked Rigby – who was returning to the Woolwich barracks from a recruitment fair, dressed in a Help for Heroes sweatshirt – because \"it just so happened that he was the soldier that was spotted first\".</p><p>At times during the interviews Adebolajo wrapped himself in a light blue blanket taken from his cell, because he felt cold. Speaking in a matter-of-fact way, he said: \"It was almost as if Allah had chosen him … when I thought about obeying Allah in the past I thought maybe it is possible to kill a man by driving into him.</p><p>\"When he crossed the road in front of me … it was almost as if I was not in control of myself.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384293'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387446824013/Adebolajo-in-a-blue-blank-011.jpg' alt='Adebolajo in a blue blanket' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Michael Adebolajo wrapped in a blue blanket during a police interview after the killing. Photograph: Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>\"I accelerated. I hit him and I think I crashed into a signpost. We wished to fulfil our promise to Allah. We did not wish to give him much pain.</p><p>\"I could see he was still alive … we exited the vehicle and I am not sure how I struck the first blow … the most humane way to kill any creature is to cut the jugular … he may be my enemy but he is a man … so I struck at the neck and attempted to remove the head.\"</p><p>Adebolajo has been assessed as being sane before his interviews, with no history of mental problems. The video images of Adebolajo at the scene at first seemed to show someone out of control. But the truth may be even worse: that his thinking was warped into believing his adopted religion allowed him to decide all the world was a battlefield and that he was entitled to kill a soldier.</p><p>Other terrorists who have attacked in Britain wanted to kill as many civilians as possible; Adebolajo and Adebowale had decided to target one soldier.</p><p>Rigby, 25, who was from Middleton, Greater Manchester, was the father of a two-year-old boy, Jack. He had served in Afghanistan and was described by senior officers as a \"professional and incredibly brave\" soldier who had faced gun battles with insurgents and patrols at risk of improvised explosive devices.</p><p>Off duty and returning to barracks after the recruitment fair at Tower Bridge, he can have had no idea of the horror that awaited him as he turned on to Wellington Street. In the dreadful moments after the attack one woman at the scene asked Adebolajo if he was going to harm the passersby. Adebolajo said: \"No, the women and children are safe. You need to keep back when the police and the soldiers get here.\"</p><p>He gave the warning because he and Adebowale planned to rush at armed police, who were then arriving, while brandishing a gun and knives, hoping to be shot dead.</p><p>The British academic Paul Gill, who has studied terrorists for a US government study, said they may have chosen to be discriminate in their target because they believed it would make it \"more difficult to paint their actions as the work of 'madmen' or 'lunatic extremists'\".</p><p>Adebolajo thought of himself as a soldier. Despite his arrest, after his video confession, after being shot, and despite his detention, he thought he could still be in control. He ignored legal advice to say nothing and refused to talk to detectives if he did not like their attitude.</p><p>While Adebolajo was in hospital he had a standoff with police. He wanted to wash his hands, which were covered with the blood of his victim, but officers wanted to take forensic samples to help establish his guilt. Adebolajo told police: \"I'm not going to deny anything.\"</p><p></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384294'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/18/1387397691600/Lee-Rigby--011.jpg' alt='Lee Rigby\r' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Lee Rigby was returning from a recruitment event when he was killed. Photograph: MoD/PA</figcaption></figure><h2>The young Muslim convert </h2><p>Adebolajo was the dominant of the two attackers. He was born on 2 December 1984 to a Nigerian Christian family. His mother was a social worker, his father a psychiatric nurse manager in the NHS. The upbringing was strict, and his parents placed great emphasis on education.</p><p></p><p>Discipline did not stop the young Adebolajo going off the rails. His mother moved her family out of Romford, Essex, to Lincolnshire in an attempt to remove him from the influence of a street gang after he started getting into trouble. But her son returned to the capital to go to Greenwich University, where poor performance led to him dropping out of the course by his third year.</p><p>He had become interested in Islam and converted in his first year at university. The extremist cleric <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/24/woolwich-murder-influence-preacher-suspect-adebolajo\" title=\"\">Omar Bakri Mohammad</a> said he tutored Adebolajo in Islam after his conversion in 2003. Bakri Mohammad was the former leader of al-Muhajiroun, an organisation banned for professing extremist views. Several al-Muhajiroun followers have gone on to be convicted of terrorist offences in Britain.</p><p>Mohammad described Adebolajo as a shy man who had been angered by the Iraq invasion, and who would ask questions about when violence was justified. \"He asked these types of questions, like many others,\" said Bakri Mohammed. \"He was asking what to do. He was most likely affected by the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"</p><p>Bakri Mohammed, now banned from Britain, said that as a new convert, Adebolajo received special attention: \"In 2004 Muslims were feeling a lot of pressures from new laws and from Iraq.\"</p><p>Adebolajo frequently attended the group's protests. At one such demonstration he was arrested and subsequently convicted in 2006. He was also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/26/woolwich-attack-michael-adebolajo\" title=\"\">photographed at a protest outside Paddington Green police station</a> in 2007, and led some of the group's protests.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384295'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387449489128/Adebolajo-at-2007-protest-011.jpg' alt='Adebolajo at 2007 protest' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Adebolajo at a protest outside Paddington Green police station in 2007. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</figcaption></figure><p>He appears to have later attended events organised by successor groups to al-Muhajiroun until around 2011. By 2012 he claimed to have left the group.</p><p>Adebolajo fathered six children, the last born four days before Rigby's murder. He was well-read and described as pleasant by some who knew him, but with a temper. There were signs of an emerging mindset of a man attracted to the militant end of Islam from his association with Bakri Mohammed.</p><p>Adebolajo adopted a Muslim name, Mujaahid, which means one who engages in jihad. In court he renamed himself in honour of Abu Hamza, the extremist cleric <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/abu-hamza-loses-extradition-appeal\" title=\"\">extradited to the US last year</a>, and asked to be known as Mujaahid Abu Hamza.</p><p>Gill said: \"Not one of these behaviours could predict his eventual violent attack but together they tell a story of an individual becoming more deeply entrenched in militant activism.\"</p><h2>Kenya </h2><p>Adebolajo's friends say that in around 2010 he was receiving approaches from the domestic security service, MI5, asking him for information about his fellow extremists. That year Adebolajo travelled to Kenya. Some friends and family say the reason was to start a new life and to escape MI5 harassment. Others believe he was following a path trodden numerous times by jihadi wannabes. Kenya is the gateway to the lawless spaces of Somalia and the terrorist group al-Shabaab. The available evidence points to increasing radicalism being his reason for the journey.</p><p>For the west, the fight against extremism in east Africa is taken so seriously that Britain funded the construction and equipment for a Kenyan police centre as a base for anti-terrorism operations. The country receives money from the US to combat violent extremism.</p><p>Soon after arriving in Kenya Adebolajo ended up alongside people and in places associated with some of the leading al-Qaida-inspired terrorists in the region. He entered Kenya on 21 October 2010 on a scheduled flight to Nairobi. A man fitting his description was seen visiting a Mombasa mosque, Masjid Mussa, frequented by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/24/kenya-mall-siege-british-samantha-lewthwaite\" title=\"\">Samantha Lewthwaite</a>, the so-called white widow, a wanted in Kenya for alleged links to terror offences. The green and white mosque on Mwambundu Road is one of the focuses for radical Islam in the city.</p><p>The main attraction at Friday prayers in 2010 was Sheikh Aboud Rogo Mohammed, a radical preacher who had amassed a significant following with outspoken sermons in support of al-Qaida and its Horn of Africa affiliate al-Shabaab. He was the ideological leader of al-Hijra, a Kenyan affiliate of al-Shabaab, named in intelligence reports as being responsible, along with al-Shabaab, for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks\" title=\"\">Westgate shopping mall attack</a> in September this year that killed at least 67 people.</p><p>Aboud Rogo's Friday sermons featured regular calls for Muslims from Kenya and elsewhere to travel to Somalia and join al-Shabaab in their jihad against foreign forces. Today, Aboud Rogo is Mombasa's most famous Islamist martyr. In August 2012 he was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19390888\" title=\"\">killed</a> in a drive-by shooting.</p><p>The Mussa mosque is likely to be where Adebolajo met Swaleh Abdul Majid, a young man who would in 2011 marry the daughter of Aboud Rogo.</p><p>On 20 November 2010 Adebolajo caught a bus north out of Mombasa towards Lamu, a chain of tropical islands fringed with mangrove forests near the border with Somalia. The archipelago's remoteness has made it a staging post in reaching Somalia for al-Shabaab's recruitment network. Aboard the bus were five others, including the future son-in-law of Aboud Rogo, and four boys in their late teens. The group hired a speedboat to take them an hour's ride north to Pate Island and the remote village of Faza. Pate island was the home of al-Qaida's then leader in east Africa, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed.</p><p>Adebolajo and his companions arrived at 8pm and stayed at the basic Faza guesthouse. At first light the party moved on to Kizingitini, a nearby island that locals said was the launching point for the crossing to Somalia.</p><p>It was there that they were arrested by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/19/kenya-human-rights-anti-terror-police-killings\" title=\"\">Kenya's controversial anti-terror police unit </a>(ATPU), with the apparent assistance of a foreign intelligence service. The arresting officer, Inspector Stephen Khamisi, later told the magistrate that the ATPU had received outside intelligence reports leading them to intercept the group. Nine men were arrested and transferred to Mombasa. At the arraignment hearing held on 23 November 2010 they were accused of being on their way to Somalia and remanded in custody to allow police time for further investigation.</p><p>Court papers obtained by the Guardian show that by a second hearing four days later, names of four of the nine people remanded in custody had disappeared from the court record, including that of Adebolajo.</p><p>The conduct of the original hearing, as well as statements made in the dock and subsequent testimony, have given rise to two competing theories concerning Adebolajo, his travel companions and the role of the British high commission in obtaining his release. The first theory is that Adebolajo was planted on the bus to infiltrate a group of would-be militants, and that he was not meant to be detained. Certainly, the Kenyan government believed his arrest and return to the UK was not meant to be public.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384296'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387450034663/Video-grab-taken-from-ITV-007.jpg' alt='Video grab taken from ITV News of Michael Adebolajo with bloody hands holding a weapon at the scene ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Michael Adebolajo with bloody hands at the scene in Woolwich. Photograph: ITV</figcaption></figure><p>The second theory is that the Briton was a budding jihadist whose radicalism was further inflamed by mistreatment during his three days in custody. Aboubakar, a local lawyer retained by a Mombasa sheikh on behalf of the parents of three of the younger boys in the arrested group, said there had been serious concerns that they could be tortured by the ATPU.</p><p>He said the boys told him there was \"more than one white man present at the arrests\". At his court appearance the Briton was caught on video saying: \"These people are mistreating us and we are innocent, believe me.\"</p><p>Both theories of Adebolajo's intent in Lamu and his treatment in Kenyan custody rely on the contradictory testimony of his fellow detainee Swaleh. Now in hiding as he claims to be at risk of assassination, he has variously told relatives that he did not know Adebolajo before boarding the bus with him for Lamu and that he was \"suspicious\" of the foreigner; and that the pair became acquainted on the bus and quickly decided to travel together.</p><p>Another radical cleric, Abubakar Shariff, who has taken up the mantle of the murdered Aboud Rogo and Ibrahim Omar, says Swaleh told him privately that Adebolajo had been threatened with sexual assault while in the custody of the ATPU. He said the Briton had been stripped and threatened with rape with the muzzle of an AK-47. But Kenya's coastal province police chief, Aggrey Adoli, denied all allegations of mistreatment or torture, saying: \"The police do not abuse suspects.\"</p><p>A spokesman for the ATPU, Boniface Mwaniki, said the Briton was \"deported\" on 26 November. However, Kenyan immigration officials have privately contradicted this account, claiming he left on a commercial flight and his passport was not stamped with an order forbidding any re-entry to the country – standard practice in the event of deportation.</p><h2>Returning home </h2><p>On his return to the UK, Adebolajo claimed to friends and family that his harassment by MI5 continued as intelligence officers pressed him to be an informer. According to family members he told of being beaten and threatened with sexual violence and death. His family say he returned to the UK a changed and embittered man.</p><p>In 2012 Adebolajo and his family went to a group called CagePrisoners to complain about his treatment. His brother, Jeremiah, who was working at a university in Saudi Arabia, claimed he had been approached and pressured by MI6 for information.</p><p>Adebolajo said there was British complicity in his ill-treatment in Kenya. He confided in a friend, talking of abuse at the hands of the Kenyans. He also claimed that on 12-13 March 2012 an MI5 agent had met him in central London. According to a CagePrisoners note, Adebolajo said the agent pressed him to work for MI5, and sent several text messages to keep up the pressure. The last one read: \"We have no option but to proceed without you.\"</p><p>MI5 is also alleged to have pressured other family members to use their influence to get Adebolajo to co-operate with the security service.</p><p>A friend who cannot be named for legal reasons said Adebolajo became radicalised in late 2012. The friend saw profound changes in his character, which he attributed to his experiences in Kenya and on his return to Britain. Adebolajo had described to his friend how during interrogation \"they told him: 'You are not in the UK now.' They took his private parts and said we will F-you [sic]. He told me he was physically assaulted and sexually threatened. If you looked at his face, he was holding back tears,\" the friend said.</p><p>When Adebolajo returned to England he was interviewed by MI5 officers. The friend said: \"His whole concept was he wanted to live in a Muslim land because at the time he was being harassed by MI5. They were knocking and knocking on his door. He pretended not to be there but then he spoke to the agent. They said we just want to speak to you and they wanted to ask him if he knew certain people.\" The friend said he believed Adebolajo declined MI5's offer. \"His word was: 'They are bugging me,'\" he said.</p><p>Less than a year before the attack, Asim Qureshi from CagePrisoners saw Adebolajo, and his sister Blessing. Their main concern was alleged threats from the security services to their brother Jeremiah. Qureshi said he was struck by how in control of himself Adebolajo was and also by how lucid he was.</p><p>Adebolajo said he had been in al-Muhajiroun, but had left feeling a spiritual element was missing.</p><p>There is one report placing Adebolajo as a regular volunteer at an extremist stall outside a bank in Woolwich High Street handing out Islamist propaganda in the runup to the murder. One witness said he had been seen outside Plumstead community centre encouraging people to fight in Syria.</p><p>But the week before the attack should have been one of joy for Adebolajo. His wife gave birth to a son, his sixth child. Instead, he and Adebowale were planning the attack on a soldier, with CCTV recovered by the police investigation showing the purchase of knives for use in the attack.</p><h2>Adebowale </h2><p>Adebolajo was the dominant one of the killers. Adebowale, from Greenwich, south London, was also a convert to Islam who had attended rallies held by successor groups to al-Muhajiroun. He attended one outside the US embassy in London as recently as September 2012.</p><p>Adebowale, who brandished a gun at police, had his thumb shot off by an armed officer.</p><p>Police do not know how the two men met, although they believe the pair attended various mosques in south London. One attended a community centre in Greenwich which held prayer sessions.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384297'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387449588770/A-man-contemplates-at-a-s-006.jpg' alt='A man contemplates at a scene where flowers lay outside Woolwich Barracks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Flowers left outside Woolwich barracks.

He showed an interest in studying at a community college in Greenwich, but never enrolled.</p><p>Like his accomplice, he was in trouble with the police as a youth. Adebowale is suspected of being a former member of a London street gang and in 2008 was sentenced to 15 months in prison for involvement in drugs supply.</p><p>He dabbled in supplying minor drugs and ran away from home on at least two occasions. He spent four days in Feltham young offender institution.</p><p>As a teenager, Adebowale witnessed a murder and in January 2008, when he was 16, he was stabbed in a frenzied attack in which one person died. The incident gives an insight into a life in chaos.</p><p>Faridon Alizada, 18, was \"literally cut to pieces\" by an assailant wielding a 12-inch knife, according to the judge at the trial that followed the incident on a housing estate in Erith, south-east London. Lee James, 32, was convicted of murdering Alizada, stabbing a 16-year-old in the neck, and stabbing Adebowale in the shoulder and hand.</p><p>The trial at Southwark crown court heard that James, a former bare-knuckle fighter, accused Adebowale and the other youths, who were Afghans, of being members of al-Qaida and plotting to carry out explosions. The court heard claims that James was suffering from drug-induced psychosis during the attack.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384298'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387450136155/High-security-armed-Met-p-006.jpg' alt='High security armed Met police convoy arrival of both Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale to Old' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Adebolajo and Adebowale arrive at the Old Bailey during the trial in a high-security armed Met police convoy. Photograph: Guy Corbishley/Demotix/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>A Greenwich neighbour said that after the attack Adebowale disappeared for a year and converted to Islam, and that his character appeared to have changed.</p><p>Madeleine Edwards, a family friend who lived in the same block of flats as Adebowale in Greenwich, said he had been involved with a local gang – the Woolwich boys – when he was a young teenager and had been in \"some serious gangland trouble\".</p><p>She claimed his mother had said he had to \"disappear for a while\". He left for about a year and on his return was a convert to Islam and had become distant.</p><p>Adebowale suffered psychological problems from the attack, with psychologists who assessed him during the trial saying he still heard the voice of his attacker. His mental health problems had been exacerbated by the excessive smoking of skunk, a strong form of cannabis. Adebowale's mental health led to the trial being delayed and, as it deteriorated during the hearing, the decision was made that he could not testify in his own defence.</p><p>Adebowale suffered from psychotic episodes during his time in custody and, it is believed, heard voices beforehand. One spoke to him in a Nigerian accent and would predict what he was about to do next, he told psychiatrists, such as predicting he would brush his teeth.</p><p>He had episodes of hallucinations that left him out of touch with reality.</p><p>Adebowale had psychotic symptoms before the attack, and psychiatrists said he felt his religion protected him, or at least lessened the terrifying effects of the psychosis.</p><p>At times he believed spirits called Djinns would make him do things and were \"playing with him\". One psychiatrist said it was a way for Adebowale to rationalise his symptoms as he complained the Djinns were changing words on paper as he tried to read them.</p><p>In one evaluation, Dr Phillip Joseph, who assessed him for the Crown, said Adebowale hinted the Djinns were \"partly responsible\" for his involvement in the attack, and then backtracked.</p><p>He feared the Djinns could travel and might hurt his mother.</p><p>The psychiatrist Neil Boast said that during an assessment on 11 November Adebowale said he was a Christian and not a Muslim.</p><p>His police interviews were not admitted as evidence. Though he was assessed as fit to be interviewed, the judge decided he had been too unwell. One source with knowledge of the interviews described him as \"bouncing off the walls\", and saying bizarre things. In his first interview Adebowale lashed out at detectives, spitting on them, before being physically restrained.</p><p>In the weeks before the attack the two men were in frequent contact. Extremist material was recovered from their homes, including sermons from Anwar al-Awlaki, one of most effective propagators of the al-Qaida-inspired message on the web. The extremist material found was still available on YouTube as Adebolajo and Adebowale stood trial.</p><p></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-425384299'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387447069854/Adebolajo-and-Adebowale-a-011.jpg' alt='Adebolajo and Adebowale at scene' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Adebowale, left, and Adebolajo at the scene.

Her <a href=\"http://www.goop.com/journal/get/258/the-annual-gift-guide\">2013 must-haves</a> include artisanal slingshots, napkins printed with customised maps and brandy glasses that roll around the table.</p> <p>Giving and receiving gifts like these, with little or no practical function, has become a more or less mandatory Christmas tradition. Come December, we are duty bound to spend money we often don’t have on things that nobody needs.</p> <p>It was the very first Christmas that set the precedent for the next two millennia of useless gifts. The gold, frankincense and myrrh delivered to the infant Jesus were designed to be purely symbolic, not practical. There’s no record of what the Holy Family did with their presents, but some suggest they sold them immediately to pay for their journey to Egypt, which should assuage the guilt of those of us who spend January eBaying our holiday tat.</p> <p>The main problem with Christmas gifts is that they just don’t make good economic sense. In his book <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8972.html\">Scroogenomics</a>, Joel Waldfogel argues most of us are terrible at predicting what other people want. By paying too much for gifts that don’t satisfy the recipients, we generate a “deadweight loss” that amounts to billions of dollars of wealth wasted every year.</p> <p>He’s not the only one who has questioned the practice of gift-giving. A British money-saving website has suggested we sign pre-nup style agreements with our family and friends to forgo presents. Going “gift-free” has been spruiked in the pages of the <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/A-Gift-Free-Christmas/1\">Oprah magazine</a> and advocated by <a href=\"http://www.buynothingchristmas.org/index.html\">Mennonite Christians</a> as a way to rediscover the reason for the season.</p> <p>The idea hasn’t quite taken off, though. Yuletide refuseniks run the risk of appearing boorish or smug, rather like those who boast about being child free or not owning a television. It’s also difficult to opt out unless everyone else does too. As anthropologists have noted, gift exchange plays a central role in reinforcing kinship bonds. It also enhances our prestige: we demonstrate our literate sensibility by giving a novel from the Booker long-list, or flaunt our quirky side with <a href=\"http://helveticatheperfume.com/\">hipster perfume that smells of nothing</a>.</p> <p>Yet there are cracks appearing in the edifice of Christmas gift-giving. Middle-class Westerners live in an age of abundance when practically anything can be acquired with a few mouse-clicks. Why give a book when your recipient can already find it on their Kindle? Why give a CD or DVD when they can download almost any file they want instantly? Soon, even the most obscure Christmas trinkets will able to be 3D printed or delivered within hours by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/04/google-robots-amazon-drones-android-droids\">Amazon’s drones, or Google’s robots</a>.</p> <p>Because we’ve become so accustomed to boundless consumer choice, many of us are embracing a new tradition that lets us get exactly what we want for Christmas: the gift card. A <a href=\"http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;op=viewlive&amp;sp_id=1694\">recent survey</a> by the US retailers’ peak body found that gift cards have never been more popular, and are the most-requested present of the holiday season. Yet while store credit might seem to be more practical than traditional gifts, it still makes bad economic sense: over half of all recipients <a href=\"http://www.choice.com.au/reviews-and-tests/money/shopping-and-legal/shopping/the-trouble-with-gift-cards.aspx?utm_source=et&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=top_gift_cards&amp;utm_campaign=choice_news_november_2013\">don’t get round to using the full value of their gift card before it expires</a>.</p> <p>What’s more, gift cards run the risk of destroying the very quality that makes a gift a gift. As French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu has pointed out, gift-giving involves a mutual suspension of disbelief. Giver and receiver know they are bound together in a ritual economic exchange that typically imposes the obligation of a counter-gift of equal value. But we agree to participate in a game of pretence that gifts are born from a noble spirit of generosity with no self-interest or expectation of return (even as we privately note how well others’ gifts stack up with our own). When Christmas presents are reduced to a naked transaction of dollar amounts – as in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/gifts\">Facebook’s gift shop</a>, which let us swap $25 discount codes via email – it’s hard to maintain the illusion we are participating in a transcendent act of kindness.</p> <p>So what is the answer to the meaninglessness of Christmas gift-giving? One response has been to seek out handcrafted, one-of-a-kind objects to regain a sense of authenticity and personal feeling, either by making them oneself or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/11/artisan-christmas-gifts-australian-presents-for-under-the-tree\">paying others to</a> do so. But glitter-dipped pinecones and crocheted coffee-cup cosies often seem to even more conspicuously pointless than store-bought tchotchkes.</p> <p>A better option is making Christmas gifts actually do something useful. <a href=\"https://unwrapped.oxfam.org.au/\">Oxfam Unwrapped</a> cards, which let us exchange a symbolic token while making a difference to global poverty, are increasingly popular alternatives to traditional presents. The innovative non-profit <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a> even allows us to transfer cold, hard cash (surely the best gift of all) to impoverished families in Kenya and Uganda via mobile phone payments.</p> <p>The idea of pivoting outwards to the community is what the festive season was once all about, before its reinvention in the Victorian era as a private family ritual practised behind closed doors. Christmas in the middle ages was a time of feasting, dancing, public drunkenness – and giving practical help to the poor. Which sounds like a much better idea than swapping novelty ties and electronic salt and pepper shakers with distant relatives.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/19/1387413424714/92ace9f8-9d4e-4e4b-8365-667437cd5e3d-140x84.png"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/19/the-case-against-christmas-presents","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/19/the-case-against-christmas-presents","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Investing in sustainable water systems: who is leading the way?","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-18T16:13:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/dec/18/sustainable-waster-wastewater-development-cities","fields":{"body":"<p>Out of the many obstacles development professionals face in the water and wastewater sectors – financing, poor planning, land tenure, technology – the one issue that seems to eclipse all the others is leadership.</p><p>Jemima Sy, senior water and sanitation specialist at the World Bank <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water\" title=\"\">calls it</a> \"prioritising in the face of competing priorities\"; Bastien Simeon, global head of water at KPMG, <a href=\"https://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">says</a> it's having the \"courage to invest in the medium to long-term\", beyond a political term; Shayo Holloway, group managing director of <a href=\"http://www.lagoswater.org/\" title=\"\">Lagos Water Corporation</a>, says it's about ensuring you can recover your costs, even if it means raising tariffs.</p><p>Good leaders are a rare breed. Sy says that many municipalities and mayors, particularly outside capital cities, are well-meaning but have little understanding of what options are available to them and make inadequate investments as a result. \"There is a lot more work to be done on getting knowledge to the people who need it most,\" she says.</p><p>Sy and Simeon argue that this is where the private sector can be a valuable partner. \"Many operators have been in the market for decades, they can bring real knowledge and expertise,\" says Simeon. The partner doesn't necessarily have to be foreign: Sy says that Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital city, contracted service provision in illegal settlements to local entrepreneurs to circumvent the law, which prohibited the state utility from servicing these areas.</p><p>Sy argues that given the right incentives, the private sector is more adept at navigating and adapting to the complexities of the sector than public entities. But the private sector has also been called upon for its financial might. Faced with a USD$3.5bn water infrastructure gap, Holloway says that authorities in Lagos had no alternative. \"The government realised that we couldn't single-handedly finance the sector,\" says Holloway. So <a href=\"http://programme.worldwaterweek.org/sites/default/files/ayinde-presentation_lagos_government_-_draft2.pdf\" title=\"\">Lagos State passed a public-private partnership (PPP) law</a> (pdf) to facilitate private sector participation and devised a comprehensive, 10-year water strategy that will see it through to 2020.</p><p>By then, says Holloway, the city will be the third most populous in the world and much of the infrastructure will have been financed, built and run by private companies. Detractors of PPPs <a href=\"http://www.citizen.org/documents/Top10-ReasonsToOpposeWaterPrivatization.pdf\" title=\"\">argue that the private sector's quest for profit leads to tariff increases</a>, but being able to balance the books is essential to make the sector sustainable, says Holloway.</p><p>Politicians have traditionally been reluctant to raise water and wastewater tariffs because the measure is unpopular with customers, but perceptions are changing. Holloway says that Lagos has the largest middle-class in Nigeria, so he admits that his consumers' willingness to pay is higher than in many other cities, but he says that the notion of paid-for service is sinking in.</p><p>The same can't be said yet for wastewater services, argues Simeon, which makes wastewater infrastructure even more difficult to finance than water. The trick, he says, \"is not to see wastewater as just something you have to get rid of but as a resource.\" He gives the example of the <a href=\"http://www.nwc.com.sa/english/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">National Water Company</a> in Saudi Arabia who is investing heavily in reuse: the utility treats effluents, which can then be sold for irrigation or industrial use. In Saudi Arabia, reused water is cheaper than desalinated water so NWC has plenty of demand. \"Wastewater is becoming a resource that is helping them finance new projects,\" he says.</p><p>Del McCluskey, global lead for environment, climate change and urban services at <a href=\"http://www.dai.com/\" title=\"\">DAI</a>, says that developing world cities must also innovate with the configuration of wastewater systems because the 'old-world' model of a centralised, extensive piped network is prohibitively expensive. Manila is a good example: the city opted for small, decentralised networks and sceptic tank collection systems. Sy also highlights <a href=\"http://saner.gy/\" title=\"\">Sanergy</a> in Nairobi, which has developed a franchise of public latrines called 'fresh life'; the latrines are run as businesses by franchise holders and Sanergy collects the faecal sludge every day, which it then transforms into fertiliser.</p><p>Finally, developing cities could benefit from using '<a href=\"http://www.swan-forum.com/\" title=\"\">smart networks</a>': this new technology allows utilities to detect leaks, regulate pressure, monitor water quality in real time, which can help save costs and improve efficiency. Amir Peleg, founder and CEO of technology firm <a href=\"http://www.takadu.com/\" title=\"\">TaKaDu</a> and chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.swan- forum.com/\" title=\"\">Smart Water Networks Forum</a>, says that cities in the developing world have the opportunity to leapfrog to smart networks, just like the telecoms sector did with mobile phones.</p><p>Many cities in Latin America and China have already made the leap, although this is less true in Africa where structural bottlenecks like power shortages and IT literacy have made it more difficult to adopt the technology.</p><p>So where to start? Holloway advises utilities to optimise existing infrastructure – improving billing and collection, reducing leaks etc – before embarking on extensions. McCluskey adds that municipalities should ensure developers meet water and wastewater infrastructure standards in new sites to avoid compounding the problem. Resolving land tenure issues in illegal settlements would also facilitate investment in slums.</p><p>Commitment from leaders will be critical for progress to be made. With so many sectors calling for their attention, it can be hard for decision-makers to prioritise. But the investment will pay off: Sy says that the 2008 drought cost Kenya USD$2.8bn, about 10% of their GDP, a figure that pushed the issue right up the agenda.</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The entrance is flanked by multicoloured mattresses stacked like surreal sandwiches. Rolls of linoleum flooring stand under shelves groaning with speakers, while cooking pots hang from the rafters amid the bunting of adverts for a pay-TV service.</p><p>Sally Kayoni, the shopkeeper, stands on tiptoe to be seen over a counter lined with car batteries, radios and DVD players. Yet the prime retail space on the eye-level shelf behind her is given over to small solar lamps presented in a neat row. They get pride of place because they are among her bestsellers.</p><p>\"I had so many customers asking for them,\" she says. Each month she sells more than 200 of the simple devices, which cost a little over £6 and when charged in direct sunlight will light a small room from dusk to dawn.</p><p>The 34-year-old runs one of the busiest shops in Bomet, a fast-growing town of four streets and clanking construction two hours' drive from Kenya's world-famous safari destination, the Masai Mara. With its paved roads and electricity, it is typical of east Africa's new boom towns, servicing a hinterland of small farms that operate off the grid, accessible by dirt roads plied by motorcycle taxis.</p><p>Kayoni first started to notice the solar lamps when they were brought to the area in 2012 in a striking canary-yellow van owned by SunnyMoney, a subsidiary of the UK-based charity <a href=\"http://www.solar-aid.org/\" title=\"\">SolarAid</a>.</p><p>They were initially distributed through the area's schools, where head-teachers were persuaded to pitch the lamps to parents as a way of helping children to do their homework. One year on, a conventional market for the lights has been created and they are sold in shops.</p><p>A business owned by a charity may sound novel, but rather than giving away solar lamps, SunnyMoney has deliberately chosen a commercial strategy, in the belief that this way its simple but effective technology can find an enduring foothold.</p><p>\"We take a business approach because that is what this market needs,\" says Steve Andrews, chief executive of the not-for-profit company. He wants to see solar technology follow in the footsteps of mobile phones, which have become ubiquitous in Africa over the past decade, thanks to a support network of retailers and services.</p><p>SunnyMoney has sold close to one million lights, making it the biggest retailer of solar lamps in sub-Saharan Africa. On average it makes a loss of 13p on each light it sells, but when the goal is to open up new markets by selling as many as possible – rather than make an immediate return – that is a sign of success.</p><p>\"Philanthropy allowed us to be aggressive and pursue markets that didn't exist before,\" says Andrews, \"because we don't have to answer to shareholders seeking an immediate return.\"</p><p>Some 40,000 lights have been sold in the Bomet area alone and SunnyMoney is on course to break even in the next two years, at which point profits will be ploughed back into the parent charity SolarAid. What some donors might find controversial is the chief executive's belief that people value more a product they have to pay for than something given away.</p><p>Much of sub-Sahara Africa is littered with the detritus of good intentions – projects from refrigerated fish-packing factories on desert lakes, to secondhand computers – that failed to meet real needs in the communities where they landed.</p><p>Fewer than 20% of Kenyan homes have access to electricity and are therefore forced to use fossil fuels such as kerosene for lighting. Households that give up the kerosene lamps they used previously can expect to make a saving of roughly £40 a month, which can be spent on school fees, food and other goods. \"Previously the money was leaving the community and going to global oil companies [through kerosene sales],\" Andrews says. \"Now it is going to local businesses.\"</p><p>The educational impact of thousands of solar lights in once-dark homes can be measured around Bomet. Christopher Sigei, the area education officer, has been doing just that: \"In the evening it has been working small miracles.\"</p><p>Asked about local access to electricity, he smiles and describes it as \"zero point something\". The average mark in national exams in the poorest neighbourhood, he points out, has risen from 215 to 233 in the first year since the lights went on sale.</p><p>These kinds of benefits have turned headteachers such as Stanley Rugut into solar evangelists. The beaming 58-year-old, who has sold about 6,000 lamps, drives around the area's rutted roads in a battered old estate car with leopard-skin seat covers and a solar panel on the dashboard. \"I like to charge the lights while I'm driving,\" he explains.</p><p>He talks about old model S1 and S2, as well as newcomer light system Sun King, with the same enthusiasm with which smartphone owners debate the pros and cons of new brands and handsets. Rugut has been rewarded for his hard work with lights rather than cash, and his skills as a salesman have allowed him to amass dozens of the lamps.</p><p>\"I have all of them, and people are always coming round and very excited to see them,\" he says.</p><p>Meanwhile, back at the Murenju general store, the one thing you will not find is kerosene. \"I no longer sell it,\" says Kayoni. \"After I started selling these,\" she points at the solar lamps, \"there was no one asking for it any more.\"</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/12/13/1386973123435/Sally-Kayoni-at-Murenju-G-004.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/dec/15/christmas-appeal-solar-lamps-sunnymoney","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2013/dec/15/christmas-appeal-solar-lamps-sunnymoney","sectionName":"Society"},{"webTitle":"Kenya at 50: how social media has increased the pace of change","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-13T14:17:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/dec/13/kenya-social-media-mark-kaigwa","fields":{"body":"<p>Kenya is currently celebrating 50 years of independence.

The 2013 general election isn't just remembered for the televised debates (a first in Kenya) but also by Four-square check-ins, tweets and images from all over the country. And when president Kenyatta's win was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/31/kenya-court-upholds-kenyatta-victory\" title=\"\">upheld in the Supreme Court</a>, Twitter discussionsv acted as the citizen's gallery outside the courtroom.</p><h2>Political activism from a disengaged middle class</h2><p>In 2012, Boniface Mwangi and a number of graffiti artists made provocative street art exhibits that caricatured Kenyan members of parliament, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">branding them as vultures and making headlines around the world</a>. The nation took notice but didn't act or appear to be as moved as perhaps the activist may have envisioned. In June 2013, Boniface rallied Kenyans online – on Twitter, Facebook – to take to the streets in a protest against legislators who were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/12/kenyan-mps-accept-pay-cut\" title=\"\">determined to give themselves a hefty pay rise</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bonifacemwangi/status/365914247194091520\" title=\"\">#OccupyParliament</a> was born.</p><p>The result saw an unprecedented number of the Kenyan \"digerati\" and middle class protest and peacefully express their position to lawmakers. Standing in place for Kenyans from all backgrounds they were creative in their slogans and props (including the most controversially, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22522846\" title=\"\">the use of pigs</a>). It is undeniable that the #OccupyParliament demonstrations have heralded a new age of activism.</p><h2>Decrypting Westgate: terrorism in the digital age</h2><p>This year also saw tragedy in the form of the Westgate Mall attack. The Al-Qaeda linked groupm, Al Shabaab, used Twitter in a way that  in today's digital age, the terrorists are as connected – and prepared to use that connectivity – as their victims. Kenyans retweeting and responding to the militant group didn't realise they were playing into their hands by amplifying their message when traditional media wouldn't.</p><p>Kenya's traditional media came under fire, again on social media, for its ethics when portraying the crisis. A <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelzarrell/outrage-over-newspaper-images-of-kenyan-attack\">front cover of the Daily Nation sparked uproar  </a>and the newspaper's managing editor lost his job as a result..</p><p>But the overwhelming power of social media has been in its ability to unify Kenyans and spread a message of solidarity following the Westgate attack. The hashtag #WeAreOne went on to feature in political speeches telling the Kenyan-Somali community that unity would prevail.</p><p>When the embers had cooled, Kenyans took once again to Twitter to question how well the security services had responded in the crisis. Known as \"the Westgate Questions\" concerned citizens <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14TPKjLym-hulKAZhca1xIE4YldJNyiAHx92xJBDpEQ4/preview?sle=true\" title=\"\">crowdsourced questions they felt were still unanswered</a> by mainstream media and the government. The 85 questions posted in that document are a great guage for what Kenyans are thinking and feeling, and social media facilitated their curation.</p><p>But even as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KenyaAt50&amp;src=tyah&amp;f=realtime\" title=\"\">#KenyaAt50</a> continues to attract hundreds of tweets, this one from chief justice <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WMutunga/status/411086046172958720\" title=\"\">Willy Mutunga</a> stands out: \"Seeing this great expression of patriotism and nationhood I agonize over the reality that we are not yet a nation!\" On Jamhuri Day social media can act as an echo box, amplifying a few voices or key messages but Dr Mutunga's tweet alludes to the fact that the whole truth isn't always conveyed in tweets.</p><p>As Kenyans celebrates, on and offline, there is no mention of the myriad of issues looming heavy on our hearts, from the rising tax hikes on the \"basket of goods\" that the common citizen relies on, to justice for the victims of post election violence. In this climate we cannot ignore that some members of parliament are determined to muzzle the media and civil society.</p><p>Kenya is an increasingly connected country and after the events of 2013, it is evident that how politicians engage with citizens and how civil society mobilises those same citizens won't be the same again.  On a weekend that sees the country celebrate 50 years of independence it is certain that despite all things – good and bad – that have taken place in 2013, the next 50 years will be transformed by personal technology, concerned citizens and the media.</p><p><em>Mark W Kaigwa is a social media consultant.

Many celebrated resistance leaders would become national independence heroes.</p><p>I was born that year, and I too will celebrate my 50th in 2013. Those who were a little older on 12 December must have felt such joy, hope and optimism for the future.</p><p>As we look back at the achievements in the decades since, we know there is much to celebrate, but also much to worry about.</p><p>It has been a long journey from independence to democracy. A dark cloud that still hangs over us is the crisis following the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/31/world/africa/31kenya.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">presidential elections in 2007</a>. Protests at the official outcome turned into violence that quickly spiralled out of control.

Rich and poor alike sought refuge in church compounds across the country. Five years on, the wounds haven't healed and reconciliation is still some way off. But this is a journey of faith that will take some time.</p><p>As Africans, we should draw our inspiration at this time from Nelson Mandela, working to ensure that reconciliation truly brings our country together. The world celebrates this global icon because of the strong values of reconciliation he bequeathed his country.</p><p>So, <a href=\"http://www.kenyaat-50.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Kenya@50</a>. What do we have to celebrate? Plenty. Kenya has produced great athletes who have shone on the world stage: Kip Keino, Ben Jipcho, John Ngugi, to name a few, and who can forget the unbeatable <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/09/david-rudisha-world-record-olympic-800m\" title=\"\">David Rudisha – breaking the men's 800m world record with a time of 1:40.91 </a>at the London Olympics last year?</p><p>Another Kenyan of whom we are proud is the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2004/\" title=\"\">late Nobel prize laureate Wangari Maathai</a>, an environmentalist and activist who taught us that everyone is responsible for playing their part in protecting the environment. And there are many more writers, artists, fashion designers and business entrepreneurs who are making Kenya a great modern nation.</p><p>Over the past 10 years there has been marked development in our infrastructure, hotels, and technology services. People from across the world have set up businesses in the capital, Nairobi, and bring their families to live with them. However, poverty remains a huge concern for the country – the gap between rich and poor is stark. The elite, mostly living in Nairobi, fly around in helicopters and private jets, living just a few paces from others in the shanty towns who can only afford to eat one meal a day.</p><p>In the rural areas, people struggle to grow enough food; they have limited access to clean water and basic services. The constant threat of hunger is never far away. Our anniversary celebrations should propel us to find lasting solutions to this kind of poverty.</p><p>UK aid agencies such as <a href=\"http://www.cafod.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Cafod</a> campaign on climate change and are working with communities in my diocese, to find innovative coping strategies – like vegetable gardens grown in large sacks, allowing families to be more efficient with the precious water they have. For many poor communities, the church is the first responder to their needs. We run schools and healthcare centres and – when an emergency hits – we are there offering shelter, food and water.</p><p>We, as a nation, remain threatened by the destructive forces of ethnicity, regionalism and corruption; it is this that keeps people poor and vulnerable. We need to rediscover our <em>harambee</em> spirit – our rallying cry from the independence days, which means \"pull together\", and pays no regard to religion, tribe or region.</p><p>When the bright colours of the firework displays are over, we must use this 50th celebration as a springboard to forge even further than we dreamed on that glorious December night in 1963.</p><p>We must work harder to make the dream of a unified nation a reality, where we truly feel for and reach out to one another as brothers and sisters, and where the plight of our disadvantaged brethren becomes the concern and duty of us all.</p><p><em>• Anthony Muheria is bishop of the Catholic diocese of Kitui</em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386782884292/Supporters-in-Nairobi-cel-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/dec/12/kenya-50-celebrate-worry-about-independence","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/dec/12/kenya-50-celebrate-worry-about-independence","sectionName":"Global development"},{"webTitle":"How has Kenya changed since independence? – get the data","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-12T07:00:00Z","sectionId":"global-development","id":"global-development/datablog/2013/dec/12/kenya-how-changed-independence-data","fields":{"body":"<p>As Kenya marks 50 years of independence from Great Britain on Thursday, politicians, commentators and citizens are reflecting on how the country has changed – and looking ahead to what the next-half century has in store.</p><p>Commemorative stamps have been printed, more than 60,000 people are expected at a concert in Nairobi on Thursday, and the anniversary has kicked off a lively discussion <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KenyaAt50&amp;src=hash\" title=\"\">on Twitter</a>, with messages of celebration intermingled with concern for the country's future.

However, no set of statistics can fully capture the changes the country and its citizens have experienced. Let us know in the thread below what you think is missing.</p><h2>Population</h2><p>Kenya's population has more than quadrupled since 1963, growing from more than 8.1m to more than 43m people. Today, Kenya has the sixth highest population in sub-Saharan Africa, behind Tanzania, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Nigeria.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424800363'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386786410136/Picture_297.png' alt='Life expectancy' width='416' height='324' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Life expectancy has risen from 48 years in 1963 to 60 in 2011, above the 56-year average for sub-Saharan Africa. But life expectancy in Kenya today is the same as it was in the mid-1980s, having dropped to a low of 52.8 years in 2002 before rising again.</p><h2>Economy</h2><p>Kenya is one of Africa's \"lion economies\", according to business commentators who continue to gape at the high levels of economic growth on the continent. East Africa's largest economy, Kenya has a set of ambitious targets in its bid to become a middle-income country by 2030.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424800364'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386784649522/Picture_291.png' alt='gni capita kenya' width='426' height='309' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Note: Atlas method, current US$</figcaption></figure><p>In 1963, Kenya's gross national income (GNI) per capita stood at about $100. By 2012, that figure was estimated at $850. Economies reach the World Bank's lower middle-income category when their GNI per capita surpasses $1,036.</p><h2>Poverty</h2><p>Poverty levels remain high in Kenya. The country is unlikely to meet the millennium development goal (MDG) to halve extreme poverty by 2015. The most recent data suggests roughly 45% of the population lives on less than $1.25 a day, and more than 65% on less than $2.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424800365'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386785309677/Picture_295.png' alt='poverty kenya' width='417' height='321' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Note: poverty headcount ratio at $1.25/day (PPP)</figcaption></figure><p>While progress has been made since 2000, when an estimated 52% of people lived on less than $1.25 a day, more people live in poverty in Kenya today than in the early 1990s.</p><h2>Health</h2><p>Kenya will also struggle to meet many health-related MDGs, despite progress in a number of areas. Child mortality rates, for example, have dropped significantly since independence. In 1963, about 175 children under five were dying per 1,000 live births; by 2011, that figure had fallen to less than 73. The proportion of people living with HIV, meanwhile, has fallen from a high of 10% in the late 1990s to 6% in 2012.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424800366'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386784512612/Picture_289.png' alt='child mortality kenya' width='415' height='324' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><br />Government spending on health remains low, at less than 6% of national expenditures in 2011, compared with 11% in neighbouring Tanzania. There are still fewer than 20 doctors per 100,000 people in Kenya, though this is significantly higher than in the 1960s, when that number was closer to eight.</p><h2>Mobile phones</h2><p>Kenya is now seen as almost synonymous with African technology and innovation. Stories about the growth of mobile phone use – and related innovations such as M-Pesa, which allows people to transfer money using a mobile phone – have played a large part in this.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424800367'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/11/1386784689731/Picture_292.png' alt='mobile phones' width='411' height='321' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In 2012, there were more than 71 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 Kenyans – significantly more than in neighbouring Tanzania, where the figure is 57, and sub-Saharan Africa, where the average is 53. In the context of the past half-century, however, mobile phone use is still a new phenomenon.</p><h2>What do you think?</h2><p>No five charts could ever capture the changes and dynamics of a country over 50 years. If you live or have lived in Kenya, we want to hear from you. How do these figures match your experiences? Have any of these changes had a profound impact on your life?

Is this predominantly American institutions or membership? Or is it more global?</strong></p><p>It started in Silicon Valley, as a group of individuals who had made their wealth in the hi-tech industry, but it very quickly spread beyond.</p><p><strong>So what is the model?</strong></p><p>The model is based on peer learning, between the forum and each of its regional affiliates. We have annual conferences and programmes, but most importantly we have matchmaking among them. For example, if you're a philanthropist and need help to raise the status of women in southeast Asia, we will introduce you not to an NGO that is doing that work, but instead to other philanthropists that are having very high impact in that field and location.</p><p><strong>The word 'impact' comes up a lot in philanthropy. Tell me why that matters so much to philanthropists and how you would define it.</strong></p><p>Philanthropists have always wanted to achieve results. I think what might be new is that we have a tendency to use metrics/measurements. We often will hire professionals to help in that regard, but most importantly, what we do is work with the grantee in the beginning and say 'what will be your measure of success'?</p><p><strong>Do you think that this interest in grantees' measures of success makes philanthropists different from other stakeholders or donors in development?</strong></p><p>You know what's really interesting to me – you've asked if there's a difference between the way philanthropists are now operating, and how other donors like bilateral donors and intergovernmental agencies might be acting. I'm finding that they're influencing one other. You're starting to see conversations take place between philanthropists and developing agencies about how they each measure success. That data has a powerful impact. It means that philanthropists, and most importantly, their grantees, will have access to that data that will allow them to compare across sectors/organisations/societies to compare what works and what doesn't.</p><p><strong>Do you think there is a long view in philanthropy? Do philanthropists think more about how to help solve today's problems, or are they also equally as interested in investing in the slow burn? </strong></p><p>What you've asked about is really the division of labour between government and non-governmental actors. And that really varies from country to country. I come from the US where there is a deep suspicion of government and a tendency to feel that we should take our future into our own hands. Sometimes we take it to quite an extreme, I should note! But having said that, philanthropy is a large part of our lives because we do pay less in taxes, we do have less of an expectation of government when it comes to meeting social needs.</p><p><strong>The traditional image of a philanthropist is a white male. Is this changing and if it is what does that mean? What impact is that having on how priorities are decided and how philanthropy is practiced?</strong></p><p>The demographics of philanthropy have really changed and that's most exciting. In north America the philanthropists who are most active are relatively young, they're mid career and taking some of the skills they've developed in their professional lives and applying them to their philanthropy. You're having philanthropists step up to the plate, you're seeing this in Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, India and Brazil and elsewhere, even in China – and that's a very important development.</p><p><strong>Are there any trends that are really impacting on philanthropy, technology, and climate change?</strong></p><p>When it comes to evolution of philanthropy, the single biggest influence has been the structure of the global economy. On the one hand it created great wealth, lifted many from poverty, but on the other there have been great economic disparities and in fact it's exacerbating them. That really has captured the attention of philanthropists and development agencies/governments alike. That's part of the structure of that economy and so the only way to offset that is through good policy, good government programmes and smart philanthropy. We all have an obligation to do that. Another enormous influence has been technology, particularly communications technology.</p><p>The role of data is also important. We now have this extraordinary opportunity to tap big data in order to solve large social problems with intergovernmental agencies like the OECD, World Bank and even governments like the US's are choosing to open up their data.</p><p><strong>So there are things that philanthropy does well, but also that it doesn't do so well. Tell me a bit about failures in the sector and the lessons learned.</strong></p><p>There's more discussion of risks in principle than there is about sharing failures. One of our weaknesses has been we talk a lot about risk and we talk a lot about transparency but usually only in relation to others.. Transparency is quite new to philanthropy but I like to think we're improving greatly in that regard but we're not there yet. One of the reasons people join organisations like ours is to have the opportunity to share with peers in an off the record format. The real goal is social impact.</p><p><strong>What are the funding trends? Who do you tend to fund? Do you give money to large NGOs or grassroots organisations?</strong></p><p>When it comes to large organisations v small or grassroots, more philanthropists are trying to find the truly local organisation and the reason that they're interested is they want more direct access to the ultimate beneficiary. So there's a bit of a bias towards the smaller organisations rather than the larger, but that doesn't mean it's easy to source them. that's why it's so important there are philanthropists coming from many different societies, that know their communities well. One of the reasons we're eager to have regional affiliates whose philanthropists are embedded in the larger global community is that they are transmission belts for that knowledge.</p><p><strong>Would the disappearance of large American NGOs be that big a deal, if the idea is that capacity is being built in countries where the demands are? </strong></p><p>Transitions are always dangerous moments, when for a  long time you've relied on one infrastructure and you would like to rely on a different one. The danger isn't money flowing away from large US-based NGOs to smaller non-profits and social enterprises, it is what happens in between, during that transition moment, when you might be leaving one without having found the other.</p><p><strong>Tell us about your journey and aspirations for things you're doing now and the world you want to see.</strong></p><p>I come from an upbringing that told my brothers and I that as young children we could make a difference, anyone could make a difference and therefore you should. There was a never a time in our childhood when we didn't think we should be contributing to community. I look around and I think that the most exciting thing in life is human ingenuity at work, there's nothing more inspiring in no matter what setting. Human ingenuity is really quite extraordinary, and I would just like to always see it matched by opportunity. We work with one philanthropist in Nigeria  and he says \"I was lucky. But not everybody is lucky. I'd like to institutionalise luck.\" And I think that's a good aspiration.</p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional?guni=Article:in%20body%20link\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

After all, no one – whether having come over willingly or forcibly – bothered to ask permission from those who lived here first. A byproduct of the massive and bloody land grab that birthed this country is our peculiarly broad notion of American-ness. Because unless you are, in fact, native, nobody – Mexican American, African American, or Irish American  – can claim to be \"more American\" than the next person. It's a legacy of tolerance, born of mutual illegitimacy, of which Americans can be justifiably proud.</p><p>President Obama should appreciate this more than most. He was elected twice with overwhelming Latino and Asian American support, capturing over 70% of both groups in 2012. He ran on a platform of comprehensive immigration reform, a promise he has so far been unable to deliver. What he has delivered instead is mass deportations. </p><p>Under Obama, the US has deported over <a href=\"http://www.ice.gov/doclib/about/offices/ero/pdf/ero-removals1.pdf\">1.5 million people</a>, a historic record. At the current rate of 400,000 per year, Obama will take just over 6 years to surpass the 2 million deportations Bush achieved in 8. This is despite the fact that illegal immigration has been <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/06/nation/la-na-nn-pew-illegal-immigration-down-20121206\">dropping steadily</a> for years, ever since the recession made America a much less attractive destination.</p><p>This contradiction received media attention this week, when Obama's own <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/12/03/uncle-president-obama-faces-deportation-kenya-today/04hVnIqteh0BIfyMn22XzL/story.html\">uncle</a> was spared deportation by a Boston immigration court. It also came into sharper focus the week before, when Obama was heckled on what should have been home turf, devoutly Democratic San Francisco. Ju Hong, a 24 year old Korean American Harvard researcher and undocumented immigrant (his parents had brought him to the US when he was 11 and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ju-hong/president-obama-stop-sepa_b_4371244.html\">overstayed their visa</a>), interrupted Obama minutes into a speech, shouting: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>There are thousands of families being deported. Please use your executive order to halt the deportations of all 11.5 million immigrants. You have the power to stop the deportations for all undocumented immigrants.</p></blockquote><p>Obama engaged Hong, but did so by passing the buck, replying: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Actually, I don't. If in fact I could pass all these laws without Congress, I would do so. But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of our tradition.</p></blockquote><p>It was, in a narrow sense, true: Congress passes laws and the president carries them out. It was, in a broader sense, duplicitous. Obama may not be able to ignore immigration law, but he has plenty of executive discretion over how to enforce it. And how he has exercised this power, or chosen not to, explains a lot more about why deportations have mysteriously hit record levels than Obama is willing to admit.</p><p>Administration officials would <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec13/deportation_11-26.html\">have us believe</a> deportations are simply rising with Congressional allocations to law enforcement agencies. But like every president, Obama sets enforcement priorities – most famously with his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) policy, which suspends deportation proceedings for those undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. </p><p>Obama has shifted away from Bush's preferred tactic of workplace raids to a supposedly smarter strategy that targets criminals and \"egregious\" violators, ie those who have come back after being deported multiple times. But to call this \"smart\" is a stretch. Another Obama innovation is Secure Communities, a program that feeds records from local police arrests into federal immigration databases, setting undocumented arrestees on a fast track for deportation even if they are never convicted of any crime.</p><p>The 2012 election debates saw Obama bragging about going after \"criminals, gangbangers, people hurting the community\", a grotesque distortion of his immigration record that escaped mockery only thanks to Romney's idiotic ideas about \"<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">self-deportation</a>\". <a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/10/who_are_those_gangbangers_obamas_so_proud_of_deporting.html\">One analysis</a> of deportation records found that only 14% of those deported in 2012 had a criminal record – ie not just an immigration violation, a civil matter – and just 4% were aggravated felons (a category that would cover, for example, the non-remunerative transfer of a single ecstasy pill). Presumably one of these \"gangbangers\" is <a href=\"http://file:///C:\\Users\\Michael\\Desktop\\media.ca1.uscourts.gov\\pdf.opinions\\11-2280P-01A.pdf\">Carmen Ortega</a> (pdf), a 62-year-old grandmother of 14 with Alzheimer's who has been ordered deported to the Dominican Republic, a country where she has no remaining family, after living in the US for 40 years. Her charge? \"Possession of a controlled substance.\" </p><p>This evidence suggests the Obama administration isn't following its own, supposedly targeted and humane enforcement strategies. It may be that the administration has lost control over the bloated post-9/11 national security state: There's a <a href=\"http://liftedlamp.com/category/insubordination/\">growing sense</a> that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) is a <a href=\"http://www.thesouthernshift.com/news/2010/04/ice-out-control-people-are-calling-it-rogue-agency\">rogue agency</a>, with the Ice employees' union having even sued the administration in an unsuccessful attempt to overturn Daca. Most likely though, the deportations are political maneuvering: an attempt by Obama to sell Republicans on immigration reform by acting tough, though this does more to break up families than keep communities secure.</p><p>It's the same political calculus that makes beefing up border security a necessary component of any grand compromise on immigration, producing little apart from wasteful boondoggles that are as unnecessary – Mexican net migration to the US has dropped to <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/04/23/net-migration-from-mexico-falls-to-zero-and-perhaps-less/\">zero</a> – as they are ineffective at keeping out either people or drugs. One DEA agent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/magazine/how-a-mexican-drug-cartel-makes-its-billions.html\">recounted</a> in the New York Times how Mexican cartels responded to a multi-million dollar border fence built in Arizona by constructing a catapult to toss bales of marijuana over it. He repeated: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>A catapult. We've got the best fence money can buy, and they counter us with a 2,500-year-old technology.</p></blockquote><p>The problem with this sweeten the pot strategy is it's about as likely to work as border fences. House Speaker John Boehner has made it clear he will not bring the Senate's immigration bill before the House for a vote. No matter how many Dominican grandmothers Obama deports, he will never win over a Republican House that would rather shut down the government than cooperate in any way with the White House. </p><p>So with immigration reform off the table, the only measures left are executive: redirecting resources to <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/ci_19589923-\">prosecutorial discretion</a> and <a href=\"http://lirs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LIRS-Backgrounder-on-Alternatives-to-Detention-3-12-13.pdf\">Alternatives to Detention</a> (pdf) programs, ending Secure Communities, granting more temporary work permits, cracking down on Ice, and stopping prosecutors from pursuing absurd cases, among others. Either Obama is unaware of the authority he has, or he's unwilling to use it. Though as a former constitutional law professor, he can't plead ignorance.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/29/1385757697168/Obama-meets-immigration-r-005.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/06/obama-immigration-reform-deportations-republicans","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/06/obama-immigration-reform-deportations-republicans","sectionName":"Comment is free"},{"webTitle":"Christmas appeal: how solar lamps are transforming life in one Kenyan county","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-06T15:38:01Z","sectionId":"society","id":"society/2013/dec/06/christmas-appeal-solar-lamps-kenyan-county","fields":{"body":"<p>Chepnyaliliet school, with its rough concrete walls and tin roof at the end of a dusty lane lined with cacti and wild roses, seems an unlikely place find early adopters of technology. But that is exactly what Rhoda Sigei is. The determined nursery teacher was the first person in Bomet county, a verdant patch of Kenya's Great Rift valley, to buy into the potential of using solar lamps. When the headteacher brought some samples to the school, Sigei knew she had to have one, so she asked for an advance on her tiny salary. \"It was a struggle to get the first one, but I didn't stop there. I&nbsp;bought three,\" she says.</p><p>She quickly realised the £5 orang plastic lamps, branded as d.lights, would pay for themselves because she and her husband, who farms a small plot, would no longer have to pay £8 a month in fuel for their paraffin lamp.</p><p>That is a substantial saving when you earn just 3,000 Kenyan shillings (£21) per month. A reliable light in the evenings has enabled Sigei to help her 12-year-old daughter, who is struggling at school, and let her 14-year-old son indulge his interest in science.</p><p>It has also allowed Sigei to study for a diploma that could result in her being promoted to a full teaching job that would treble her earnings.</p><p>The d.lights are part of a range of durable and affordable solar lamps made by Sunny Money, a subsidiary of the <a href=\"http://www.solar-aid.org\" title=\"\">UK charity Solar Aid</a>.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424345293'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/6/1386343625893/Rhoda-Sigai-011.jpg' alt='Rhoda Sigai' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rhoda Sigei, a nursery teacher in Bomet county, is now studying for a diploma that could see her promoted.

Being a philanthropic rather than purely commercial investor gives it extra time to develop new markets.</p><p>Chepnyaliliet, an hour's drive over rutted tracks from the nearest paved road, is dark after nightfall, like much of Kenya. The single power line that has run since 2011 to Sigei's school is not connected to any of the nearby homes. Fewer than 20% of homes in east Africa's largest economy have access to electricity and there is nothing to suggest hamlets such as this, where many of Kenya's 43 million people live, will be connected to the national grid anytime soon.</p><p>Sunny Money works by approaching schools and persuading headteachers like Chepnyaliliet's Richard Bii that their products can transform their pupils' performance.</p><p>Milton Cheriot is a prime example. The scruffy 13-year-old spends his spare time falling out of trees, testified by the scars on his smiling face. His name is stitched into his jumper so his mother can make sure her six children put on the right clothes. Now he consistently has light in the evening, Milton can concentrate on his homework.</p><p>\"In the old days we would have a lamp maybe three days a week. Now it's every day. And it doesn't produce smoke.\"</p><p>Nights spent straining his eyes to a flickering paraffin flame often led to headaches, itchy eyes and allergies, he says.</p><p>Milton says he reads for three hours every evening. It's paid off –  he scored 86 out of 100 in general science, a mark that propelled him to second spot in his school's rankings.</p><p>\"As soon as people saw someone they knew having one of these then everyone wanted to have one,\" says Bii. Mr B, as everyone calls him, estimates that after one year of sales, nearly half of the 517 pupils at his school now have the lights at home.</p><p>The 53-year-old expects to  post a big improvement in his pupils' results this year.</p><p>The money saved on paraffin has changed what families such as the Sigeis can afford to eat.</p><p>\"Instead of just eating ugali (maize porridge) every day I can mix using rice or chapatis.</p><p>\"I'm now balancing the diet for them,\" says Sigei.</p><p>The UK Department for International Development has promised to help fund the project. Justine Greening, international development secretary, said: \"Building a team of entrepreneurs to distribute over 80,000 affordable solar lights in Kenya, Zambia and Malawi means Solar Aid will provide light after sundown to thousands of families for the first time, while creating new jobs and helping people to save money. Increasing the market for solar lanterns will also benefit communities by improving access to clean energy and increasing the amount of time children can spend studying.</p><p>\"By matching Solar Aid's project pound for pound we are enabling more people in Africa to earn a decent income and helping to end aid dependency through job creation.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Sigei has her eyes on a new range of bigger, brighter lights known as Firefly and the Sun King, which come with a separate solar panel and a USB port that can be used to charge a mobile phone. The Sun King costs £25, but she has already started saving for one and expects to have enough for an upgrade early in the new year.</p><p>The willowy mother, typical of the tall, thin Kalenjin tribes of the Rift, would like her son, Hasbon, to have more choices than his father. The growing population of Bomet county means future generations will have smaller parcels of land to farm.</p><p>\"I want him to do something different. Nowadays farming has become too difficult and the plots are so small.</p><p>\"I would like him to be a doctor,\" says Sigei.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/6/1386342846276/Christmas-appeal-Milton-C-006.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/dec/06/christmas-appeal-solar-lamps-kenyan-county","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2013/dec/06/christmas-appeal-solar-lamps-kenyan-county","sectionName":"Society"},{"webTitle":"Access to mobile technology in Africa spurring social entrepreneurship","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-05T14:40:00Z","sectionId":"social-enterprise-network-partner-zone-o2","id":"social-enterprise-network-partner-zone-o2/mobile-technology-social-entrepreneurship","fields":{"body":"<p>From public transport apps such as Hailo to archival ones such as Evernote, the benefits of mobile technology for people in the developed world have been well documented.

There, the transformative effect of a technology that is largely taken for granted in the UK, such as an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">e-reader application</a>, can be immense. That transformation was the subject of a recent presentation by mobile strategist Rudy De Waele at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.campus-party.eu/2013/Whats_on_at_Campus_Party.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">O2 Campus Party</a> at London's O2 Arena, a week long technology festival.</p><p>\"People in Sub-Saharan countries have to deal with very basic kinds of infrastructural problems in transport, electricity generation or water supply, things that most of us in the West don't have to deal with\" says De Waele.</p><p>De Waele is the co-founder of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.nyotamedia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nyota Media</a>, an agency dedicated to assisting African entrepreneurs and startups using technology to improve the lives of Africans.

De Waele has over 18 years experience in internet technology, and has specialised in mobile innovation since 1999. He says there are huge opportunities in Africa right now when it comes to mobile solutions generally.</p><p>\"Over the next five years, seven of the world's ten fastest growing economies will come out of Africa. As a result, there is a growing middle class in Sub-Saharan parts of the continent, mainly in places like Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania. There's also faster growing access to mobile connectivity. The market is still largely feature phone based, but smartphone penetration is growing rapidly. These are beginning to be offered at a cost of between $50 and $70.\"</p><p>Internet connectivity is only part of the explanation for the growth in social entrepreneurship however. A crucial factor, says De Waele, is that many African countries have a very young population.</p><p>\"In some countries over 50% of the population is below the age of 20. As a result, there is a young, dynamic generation - I call them the 'wow generation' - that have their own ideas on how to change things for themselves, and that are no longer waiting for the West to come and save them. Through the internet they have access to any type of knowledge, as well as things like crowdfunding platforms and technology hubs. This allows them to avoid the bureaucracy of corrupted government or big industry players, and come up with low cost solutions to a range of problems.\"</p><p>One such example here is Kenya's <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-pesa\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-Pesa</a>, a mobile money solution that allows Kenyans to transfer money via their mobile phone. M-Pesa has surged in popularity since 2007, with almost 20 million accounts having been opened in country with a population of some 44 million people. A more recent example of how falling costs have combined with increased device mobility is the Happy Feet project. The brainchild of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vimeo.com/53013050\" rel=\"nofollow\">University of Nairobi student Roy Ombatti</a>, this uses 3D printing to create custom shaped shoes for victims of the Chigoea flea. Commonly referred to as 'Jigger disease', the flea can leave those it infects with severe, painful deformations of the feet.</p><p>The innovative use of technology in this way and the capacity for self sufficiency it creates, is a key feature of social entrepreneurship in Africa says De Waele. He also thinks it marks the death knell for the \"old\" not for profit model of fundraising and distribution.</p><p>\"In a global context, and especially in Europe, I think the old not for profit model of raising funds to distribute to other people is dead, or is dying. Big NGOs need huge marketing campaigns and that is a huge overhead. It doesn't really work anymore. With access to the internet and crowdfunding, people can choose what they want to fund. Of course it's a good thing that big NGO's do things like distribute food, but in the end they aren't helping efforts to make people self-sufficient, by growing their own food for example.\"</p><p>De Waele says that communications companies like O2 have an important role to play in all of this, certainly by continuing to provide internet access, but also by helping to develop a supportive ecosystem by \"connecting entrepreneurs, investors, business and mentors through programmes or hubs.\" &nbsp;</p><p>\"Whether Latin America or Africa, the problems and solutions are the same. When I talk to local developers, they all tell me they can learn to do things like code online, but what they really want is advice on how to set up a sustainable businesses. There's not a lot of experience in that regard, particularly when it comes to things like energy and development of natural resources. Programmes such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wayra.org/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wayra</a>, that combine all of these elements and connect them with investment, are crucial to future success.\"</p><p><strong>Content managed by O2.</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/4/1386162412936/iPhone-5-apps-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network-partner-zone-o2/mobile-technology-social-entrepreneurship","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/social-enterprise-network-partner-zone-o2/mobile-technology-social-entrepreneurship","sectionName":"Social Enterprise Network partner zone - O2"},{"webTitle":"Social investment can reap real benefits for communities and companies ","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-04T15:00:00Z","sectionId":"sustainable-business","id":"sustainable-business/social-investment-benefits-communities-companies","fields":{"body":"<p>Few private-sector employees have the satisfaction of doing work that directly transforms the lives of the world's poorest. However, through well-structured social investments, an increasing number can take a vicarious pride in the developmental achievements of their employer.</p><p>Take the cooking arrangements of the poorer half of the world, for example. Nearly 45% of the world's population prepares meals on open fires. Dangerous, dirty and very polluting, this very basic approach to cooking is a hazard to humans and to the home.</p><p>A decade ago, a project was launched to finance safer, cleaner cookstoves through a scheme that combined carbon reduction and corporate social investment. This pilot has since expanded to about 50 such projects worldwide, according to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://climatecare.org/\">ClimateCare</a>, the specialist behind the initiative. The <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.gyapa.com/gyapa-fuel-efficient-cookstove.html\">Gyapa Improved Stove</a> project in Ghana, for example – the  largest improved cookstove programme in Africa – has improved the lives of 2.4 million Ghanaians, cutting more than 1m tonnes of carbon emissions and creating more than 800 jobs in the process.</p><p>Sustainability-minded companies can derive dual benefits from their support for such an integrated project. First, there is the clear humanitarian benefit derived from safer cooking. Second, the company can offset some of its own carbon emissions. The type of cleaner cookstoves advocated by ClimateCare emit up to 40% fewer emissions than wood-burning equivalents.</p><p>Integrated projects are not restricted to clean cookstove technology, says Edward Hanrahan, director at ClimateCare, which has applied the same model of integrated offsetting to the water industry: \"There will be a big growth in the amount of corporate-funded water projects.\" The same is true of waste management, he adds.</p><h2>Integrated offsetting: getting the basics right</h2><p>A crucial requirement for this offsetting approach to corporate-led development is a long-term perspective, says Ben Norbury at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\">Co-operative</a>, a long-standing supporter of integrated climate and development projects.</p><p>\"Our strategy for combatting climate change includes emissions reduction targets through to 2020 and a long-term outlook to our offsetting that values social and environmental benefits alongside the carbon,\" he says.</p><p>Funding is flexible, says ClimateCare's Hanrahan. The total volume of carbon reductions and other project outcomes are calculated annually and, in a typical funding arrangement, a company will buy offset credits in accordance with its internal offsetting targets. The other project outcomes, such as community benefits, are measured according to the volume purchased. Companies who want full ownership of a project can make full payment upfront or at the culmination of a project – or they can pay in stages.</p><p>Project types may be flexible, too: not all integrated development projects necessarily have an offsetting element. Vestergaard, for instance, ran a multipurpose initiative in Kenya that bundled together HIV testing, water filtration, mosquito-net use and safe-sex information. But Frandsen says this approach is not the norm.</p><p>\"Most public-health initiatives focus on bringing treatments and preventions for one disease to individuals in a developing country,\" he explains.</p><h2>Beating the barriers</h2><p>One of the challenges of investing in social development projects is calculating impacts. The advantage of an integrated climate and development project is that  mechanisms are built in from the start, to measure the annual emissions reductions that finance the project. These can be adapted to generate regular reporting of wider environmental and social benefits for little extra cost.</p><p>Hanrahan believes the increasing emphasis on measurable deliverables can be attributed to the arrival of business-funded grantmakers such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that have introduced a more \"commercial perspective\" to humanitarian aid projects.</p><p>A new \"traffic light\" system has been developed by the UK's Department for International Development, for scrutinising the impacts of government-funded aid projects. Of the dozen projects studied under the system, only one was given a clear green light.</p><p>In an effort to drive efficiency and improve outputs, the government has set up a specialist unit to scrutinise aid projects. The main criteria of this Independent Commission for Aid Impact – namely, objectives, delivery, impact and learning – are useful principles for project evaluation by companies.</p><p>Another key consideration for companies investing in this kind of commercial philanthropy is to look at their internal management structures. To be successful, development projects must be aligned to the aims of the business.</p><p>Support from senior management is also critical. A development-based approach to offsetting usually works best when environmental management and social investment are managed out of the same team. If it isn't, internal alignment can become problematic, Hanrahan warns.</p><p>Ideally, projects will be designed to appeal to employees and customers alike. Involving employees in selecting which project to support is often a powerful way of gaining internal engagement. In larger companies, capacity may exist to allow employees to directly support development initiatives.</p><p>While achieving business benefits from development programmes is perfectly legitimate, balancing these with credible, tangible social outcomes is an imperative – otherwise, you can expect justified charges of greenwashing.</p><p>External auditing and endorsement is the best defence against this, says Hanrahan, who points out that businesses, NGOs and governments take reassurance from the respectability of the other players involved.</p><p><em>This content is brought to you by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business\">Guardian Sustainable Business</a> in association with ClimateCare.

In contrast, they say, innovators in poor countries keep things simple by necessity, and focus on solving real problems instead of creating demand.</p><p>\"The moment you change your attitude about value, you realise you are not anymore in love with the technology or this notion of always coming up with new stuff,\" Radjou said. \"You try to say, 'OK, if the customer is very frugal, how can I bring them more value in ways that makes it affordable to them?'\"</p><p>He added: \"Rather than reinventing the wheel and building everything from scratch again and again, you try to leverage what you already have.\"</p><p>The idea called jugaad in India is known as \"zizhu chuangxin\" in China, \"gambiarra\" in Brazil and \"jua kali\" in Kenya, the writers say.  The English translation might be DIY or \"make do and mend.\"</p><p>Everywhere, it is about entrepreneurs making the most of what they have, adapting existing technologies in new ways, cutting costs dramatically and focusing on the problems consumers need solved, say Radjou, a fellow at Cambridge University's Judge Business School, and his co-authors, Judge School professor of Indian business Jaideep Prabhu and Minneapolis-based consultant Simone Ahuja, of the firm Blood Orange.</p><p>Crucially, they say, jugaad innovators also see poor consumers as a huge market to be tapped, not as an object of charity.</p><p>The publishing giant Pearson shares that view, said Katelyn Donnelly, head of the company's <a href=\"http://www.affordable-learning.com/\" title=\"\">Affordable Learning Fund</a>, which is investing in startup, for-profit education companies that offer inexpensive schooling or materials to poor children in countries like India, Ghana and Kenya.</p><p>\"For a company like Pearson to ignore the bottom of the pyramid is to ignore half the market,\" she said. \"It's a volume game. We see that these economies are growing rapidly, they have lots of young people, a huge need to upskill their talent and a large demand.\"</p><p>Frugal innovation is widespread in poor villages and cities around the world, where inventors responding to local needs have come up with easy-to-implement ideas like the clay refrigerator in India that uses evaporation instead of electricity to cool food, and eventually biodegrades.</p><p>Big, developing-world companies like India's <a href=\"http://www.tatamotors.com/\" title=\"\">Tata Motors</a> have run with the idea, slashing costs dramatically to make no-frills cars and other products that are affordable to customers who until recently would never have dreamed of owning them.</p><p>Now, say those in the field, major multi-nationals based in the west are also starting to innovate frugally. Many offer cheaper, pared-down products in emerging markets like India, China and Brazil, but they quickly realised there was also a demand for simplicity and affordability back home, where recession and worries about a natural resource crunch mean those in richer countries are feeling squeezed too.</p><p>\"As we're coming up against some hard constraints in the West, it's becoming increasingly relevant to us,\" said Kirsten Bound, head of international innovation at the innovation charity <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\">Nesta</a>.</p><p>Some big companies are focusing on \"radical affordability,\" completely re-thinking designs to offer goods that sell for a small fraction of what traditional models cost.</p><p>The most frequently cited example, Bound noted, is the portable MAC line of electrocardiogram machines that GE Healthcare developed for India. Its premium ECGs were unaffordable in rural areas, which also lacked skilled technicians to operate and maintain them. The light-weight version, using a simple printer of the kind that prints bus or film tickets, costs $500 (£305), compared to as much as $10,000 for top-end, hospital-based units.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.siemens.co.uk/answers/en/\" title=\"\">Siemens</a>, too, has embraced frugal innovation, with an approach it terms SMART – simple, maintenance-friendly, affordable, reliable and timely to market. Such products can sell for less than half the price of a high-end piece of equipment.</p><p>The company's interest in frugality started more than a decade ago as an attempt to reach customers in emerging markets, but it now informs Siemens' entire global strategy, and consumers in developed countries are often interested in SMART products too, said Felix Scheffler, head of Siemens' Business Excellence Program and one of the company's experts on frugal innovation.</p><p>\"In the past, perceived quality was more or less attached to the technological sophistication of a product, the highest number of features,\" he said. While Siemens still sells high-end goods, engineers now focus intently from the start on delivering exactly what customers need. Especially for consumers on a budget, \"less is more. And this definitely calls for a huge change in mindset,\" Scheffler said.</p><p>Radjou, who last month won a prestigious <a href=\"http://www.thinkers50.com/media/thinkers50-2013-innovation-award-announced/\" title=\"\">Thinkers50 Innovation Award</a> for the book, says jugaad innovation is not just about making cheaper goods, but reinventing processes from design to manufacture to distribution.</p><p>The approach is generally far less centralised than traditional corporate research and development, and is enabled by information technologies that allow ideas to be easily shared, or even crowd-sourced, he says.\"Jugaad is ultimately also about this notion of empowerment and bottom-up innovation, that means citizens taking ownership of their destiny,\" Radjou said.</p><p>The $1 glasses, rough terrain wheelchair and fish farm in a shipping container were among the finalists for the <a href=\"http://www.empowering-people-award.siemens-stiftung.org/\" title=\"\">Empowering People award</a> given by Siemens Stiftung, a foundation established by Siemens.</p><p>\"It's the simplicity which is convincing, which makes (such ideas) attractive,\" said Rolf Huber, the foundation's director. When a group of designers met recently, they spent hours brainstorming new ideas, he said.</p><p>There was \"so much energy, it's so inspiring, it's so positive,\" he said.  \"These are creative guys, but they are not inventing a fashionable tool for consumers. They are all driven by the idea that they can make an impact, that they can do something to change a particular situation, and that's an incredible common ground.\"</p><p><strong>Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

Owen Beckett came up with the tongue in cheek app while studying physics at Oxford University. The app is a laser chasing game for cats, but also includes a function that takes a photo of your cat when it \"wins\" the game.</p><p>Beckett says: \"I didn't know anything about apps. I knew how to programme a bit but I watched youtube videos and taught myself how to do it.\"</p><p>Student app developers are producing fun ideas and exciting solutions to problems and showcasing their work on a global platform. If you've got the skills, developing an app might be a unique way to get yourself noticed and gain valuable experience.</p><p>Edward Noël is a mechanical engineering student at the University of Exeter, but has already spoken in front of 15,000 people and won a global app-designing competition. Together with a group of Exeter students he has formed a company that's coming up with \"unique ways of connecting people\".</p><p>The app that won them the competition will be launching in January, but Noël says: \"it's hopefully going to be a unique and exciting way of making music really social.\" Noël has also worked on an app for android phones that lets a group of people share photos when they're together simply by flicking their wrist and sending the picture on to the next phone.</p><p>He says: \"We love Facebook but we think Facebook is really quite antisocial - you talk to people on Facebook but not in person - we want to work out new ways of bringing people closer.\"</p><p>A gap in the market can be a great opportunity to design an app. Andy Jenkins, a recent Surrey University graduate, thought there weren't enough game apps out there making use of gyroscope technology to control player movement (\"Think of the wooden marble game you may have played before where you must avoid the holes\"), so he created <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AndyJenkinsCo.Edwards_Escape&amp;hl=en_GB\" title=\"\">Edward's Escape</a>.</p><p>\"The aim of the game was to try and show that complex graphics were not needed in order to make a player feel towards its characters. I also wanted to use gyroscope technology. To me it seemed the most natural and pleasant way of controlling a character and I couldn't understand why it wasn't being used.\"</p><p>Apps can be solutions to problems – and for Rob Hunt, designing an app was his opportunity to make life at uni simpler for students at Brunel University London. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mybrunel/id700330526?ls=1&amp;mt=8\" title=\"\">My Brunel</a> is an iphone app that brings together timetables, technical support and live opening times and resource availability. The app started as a dissertation project, but is now available on iTunes.</p><p>He says: \"I had to learn iPhone development to make the app. I'd always wanted to so it was a good excuse. Because it was a subject that wasn't taught on my course I hope the fact I've done it will make a difference for employers.\"</p><p>Caroline Player, a computer science student at the University of Warwick, was part of a winning team at this year's Code for Good Challenge with JP Morgan. Teams of students paired up with charities to problem-solve using technology.</p><p>Player worked with <a href=\"http://enezaeducation.com/\" title=\"\">Eneza</a>, a charity providing education for children in Kenya. She says: \"We designed an app that could go on any device. Teachers in Kenya do have basic smartphones so we made an app to connect with the students who don't have smartphones. With the app a student can send a text message with a question and that question would be sent to their teacher's phone and their phone would get the answer off Google - they could get help without having an internet connection.\"</p><p>The students worked with the charities and technologists from JP Morgan, who will now be developing the apps for the charities based on the ideas the students came up with. Simon Cooper, senior technologist at JP Morgan says: \"It was a competition but in my view everyone was a winner because all the charity partners got brilliant ideas in how they can solve the issues.\"</p><p>As well as sharing skills with the charities, students working on apps pick up valuable capabilities.</p><p>Cooper says: \"The technical capability of the students was incredible. They have incredibly relevant skill sets to the world in which we're operating in now.\"</p><p>Most students making apps aren't working on them alone – and it's that teamwork that can be a great learning experience too.</p><p>Player says: \"My degree is very theoretical. When we made the app teamwork was a key thing – we didn't have time for any errors.\"</p><p>If you've made an app and want it to go live, next comes the process of marketing it, and this in itself can be a major challenge.</p><p>Beckett found that marketing Cat Snaps was even more challenging that designing it.</p><p>He says: \"The app development was the easy part – the hard part was the branding. But now I have these skills that not everyone has. It shows a bit of entrepreneurship.\"</p><p>\"We do a lot of selling and you come to understand that a business is a lot about getting your idea out there and being really passionate about it,\" says Noël.</p><p>\"Doing this really opens your eyes to what a company is like. You have a vague idea of it but then when you're doing it it's a completely different experience.\"</p><h2>Some more app-makers to watch</h2><p>• Orfeas Boteas was a sound design student at the University of Edinburgh when he came up with <a href=\"http://dehumaniser.com\">Dehumaniser</a>, an app that lets you make monster sounds in real time.

It has already been used by the largest sound post production companies and distinguished sound designers in the world.\"</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.MyCampusRide.co.uk\">My Campus Ride</a> is a car-sharing app based in Coventry, designed by Bilal Ahmad, a former student at Coventry university.

This Christmas we focus on three inspiring charities which use low-cost technology in exciting and often ingenious ways.</p><p>\"Technology justice\" is the aim of <a href=\"http://practicalaction.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Practical Action</strong></a>. It promotes new technology, from MP3s to <a href=\"http://practicalaction.org/fireless-cooker\" title=\"\">fireless cookers</a>, as a way of tackling poverty. Its programmes include the provision of renewable, <a href=\"http://practicalaction.org/renewable-energy-village\" title=\"\">locally sourced sustainable energy</a>, development of sustainable techniques to improve agriculture, and access to drinking water and sanitation, particularly in urban centres.</p><p>Literacy is a crucial step in the eradication of poverty, and e-readers and mobile phone apps are the tool of choice of <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Worldreader</strong></a>, a global non-profit group. It uses them to distribute books and boost literacy in primary schools in some of the world's poorest countries. Half of sub-Saharan African schools have no or few books: Worldreader has distributed 721,000 e-books to more than 12,300 children in nine countries. Its results are encouraging. Less than five months after receiving one of its e-readers, children read more and read better.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.solar-aid.org\" title=\"\"><strong>SolarAid</strong></a> literally wants to light up Africa. Around 598 million Africans have no access to electricity, and many are reliant on kerosene lamps, which emit noxious smoke. The charity provides access to clean, affordable solar lights in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia. Its solar lamps, which cost as little as $10, are healthier, greener and cheap to run.</p><p>As part of this year's Christmas appeal, we are also going back to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/29/katine-farmers-flood-drought-uganda\" title=\"\"><strong>Katine</strong></a>, a rural sub-county in north-east Uganda, which the Guardian has been supporting since 2007. Thanks to readers' generosity in past Christmas appeals, the lives of Katine's 30,000 residents have improved significantly. But life still remains fragile for this farming community.</p><p>It is subject to increasingly erratic weather patterns that can destroy harvests and leave farmers to struggle, and residents have little in the way of extra assets to see them through difficult times. We're working with <a href=\"http://www.farmafrica.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Farm Africa</strong></a>, an NGO that has supported more than a million farmers across east Africa this year to improve Katine residents' access to capital and help develop their livelihoods, and take control of their futures. We will also support Farm Africa's work in Tigray in Ethiopia.

You get a chance to bring clean power to corners of the world where access to electricity could significantly improve people's lives. </p><p>That's the idea behind Vestas' Wind for Prosperity program, which the world's largest wind turbine maker is unveiling this week. The program is setting out to bring wind power to 100 communities, or more than 1 million people, in developing countries in the next three years. The Danish company plans to buy back old, kilowatt-scale turbines – which have since been replaced by megawatt-scale turbines – from wind-farm owners and refurbish them for the program.</p><p>What makes this especially interesting is that Vestas aims to show that the do-gooder projects can also be profitable. It hopes to attract a variety of private investors, including corporate investors, to help finance the program. </p><p>It has lined up two investors so far. Frontier Investment Management, a Danish equity-fund manager that focuses on renewable-energy projects in Africa, will back the first project in Kenya. And Masdar, the renewable energy company of Abu Dhabi government, plans not only to invest, but also to act as a developer for some of these projects.  </p><p>Here's another fun fact: The program is using big data - and a supercomputer - to pinpoint where the needs are greatest. </p><p>\"We decided we wanted to develop a technology solution that is also a commercial solution, and it will enable us to bring wind energy to millions of people. Finding the technology solution hasn't been the most difficult thing. The most difficult part is designing a business model that makes it attractive to investors, local business partners and the society,\" said Morten Albæk, Vestas' chief marketing officer and the brainchild of the program.</p><h2>Growing electricity and quality of life</h2><p>Electricity is indispensable to growing an economy and lifting people out of poverty. It not only improves comfort and productivity, but also makes better healthcare possible. More than 1.3 billion people, or 20% of the world's population, have no access to electricity, according to the International Energy Agency, using 2009 data. </p><p>Installation on the first Wind for Prosperity projects will start in Kenya in the second half of 2014. When completed, the installations are expected to supply wind power to up to 13 communities with approximately 200,000 residents combined. A local company – set up by Wind for Prosperity – will operate and maintain the turbines after they're installed, and the power they produce will be sold to utility Kenya Power and Light. </p><p>Aside from Kenya, the program is looking at projects in countries such as Ethiopia, Yemen, Vietnam and Nicaragua. In many cases, Wind for Prosperity projects will combine wind power generation with diesel or other fuel sources to provide uninterrupted power to poverty-stricken regions.</p><p>The program's mission is to bring power to places with limited or no access to electricity, as well as to places that rely only on carbon-emission-heavy fossil fuels for their electricity. Vestas expects it will cost roughly $200m to bring wind power to 1 million people, Albæk said. </p><h2>A supercomputer for a cause</h2><p>The concept for Wind for Prosperity came to Albæk in 2011, when he read an article about how the lack of access to electricity contributes to a high number of children in poor Sub-Saharan African communities dying before they're five years old. It so happened that, at the time, Vestas was upgrading its IBM supercomputer, which can pinpoint which places in the world are best suitable for wind generation.  </p><p>So it came to him: Why not ask the supercomputer to figure out areas that are blessed with abundant wind but beset by high child mortality rates?</p><p>Wind for Prosperity will be run as a business, not a corporate philanthropic effort, Albæk said. He believes the profit-making model will attract more investments, which will then expand the program's reach more quickly. Vestas plans to take a \"modest\" stake in some of the projects.  </p><p>\"It's about proving that there is a sweet spot between capitalism and humanism,\" he said. \"You can earn money and at the same time impacting the quality of life for millions of people.\"</p><h2>Will returns satisfy investors?</h2><p>The idea of making a profit while doing improving the lives of the poor isn't a new, of course. Over the past decade a growing number of social entrepreneurs have embedded missions – such as creating jobs, improving healthcare for low-incomes residents, improving crop yields for water-starved communities and bring solar power to places with inadequate or no access to electricity – into their business plans. </p><p>Refurbishing turbines also isn't a new concept. Although it makes up only a small part of its business, Vestas has been selling refurbished turbines to project developers who don't want to pay a premium for the latest technology. </p><p>The refurbished turbines used in the Wind for Prosperity program should perform well for 20 years, Albæk said. And the electricity from the refurbished wind turbines will cost about a third of the cost of diesel power generation, he added.</p><p>Still, investors like Frontier Investment Management shouldn't expect huge returns.</p><p>Although the program strives to show that making profit and social impact aren't mutually exclusive, these projects are unlikely to compete with conventional, large-scale wind farm projects in countries or regions with policies and incentives to support clean power development, Albæk conceded.</p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/26/1385426182929/Vestas_North.Horr.TRAIL.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/vestas-wind-prosperity","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/vestas-wind-prosperity","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business"},{"webTitle":"International Development Journalism Competition finalists","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-22T10:12:00Z","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","id":"global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/22/international-development-journalism-competition-finalists","fields":{"body":"<p><a href=\"#chugh\">• Nishtha Chugh</a><br /><a href=\"#duzgun\">• Meral Duzgun</a><br /><a href=\"#greenleaf\">• Stevie Greenleaf</a><br /><a href=\"#griffin\">• Joanna Griffin</a><br /><a href=\"#kearney\">• Helen Kearney</a><br /><a href=\"#mcbain\">• Sophie McBain</a><br /><a href=\"#sell\">• Susie Sell</a><br /><a href=\"#shearman\">• Sarah Shearman</a><br /><a href=\"#thurman\">• Ben Thurman</a><br /><a href=\"#tickle\">• Louise Tickle</a><br /><a href=\"#wan\">• James Wan</a><br /><a href=\"#würtemberg\">• Boel Marcks von Würtemberg</a></p><h2><strong id=\"chugh\">Nishtha Chugh</strong></h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-423161766'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/15/1384519507280/NishthaChugh.gif' alt='Nishtha Chugh' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Nishtha is a journalist by mission and storyteller by heart.

The partnership marks a giant leap toward making e-commerce truly accessible to businesses, large and small, around the globe. Equity Bank customers will now have access to a global marketplace from which they and most other small businesses in developing countries have been excluded, hindering their growth in an increasingly digital world. </p><p>The high costs of starting up a business and limited access to financial services, have led many young Kenyan entrepreneurs to digital alternatives to traditional business startups. Ayshah Maende, a young woman from the coastal town of Malindi in Kenya, runs her business via social media. \"Starting a business requires a lot of resources in terms of rental charges, wages and maintenance, and those resources are difficult to access,\" said Maende. \"I weighed the option of having a bricks and mortar business and realised it was way too expensive.\" Instead, she opened a \"social storefront\" on various social media platforms. </p><p>The ingenuity of youth, combined with the pervasive global usage of social media, has created a new business venue, which offers advantages over both bricks and mortar businesses and standard websites. Social media sites offer access to a ready made global network of more than one billion Facebook users and 200 million Twitter users. By comparison, digital storefronts and websites are resource-intensive, may place geographical limits on their customer network or charge fees. Social storefronts plug directly into existing networks, giving them access to customers around the world for free. </p><p>As social media become more business-oriented, social storefronts can accommodate local payment systems. Micro-entrepreneurs such as Maende and her customers, who cannot access international payment systems or credit cards, find the ability to transfer and accept payments via Safaricom's mobile currency system, <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-Pesa</a>, critical. \"M-Pesa is a quick and easy method for both my clients and me,\" said Maende. \"Since most transactions are done online, there needs to be a safe, easily available, and secure way for transactions. M-Pesa offers that.\"</p><p>Not only do social storefronts provide these young Kenyan innovators access to e-commerce, but they also help them target their offerings to products and services endorsed by family and friends. Through tools such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest, personal connections become customer networks, where an individual can display a recent purchase or describe a positive (or negative) local shopping experience for their network to see. Social media encourages young entrepreneurs to give their customers real-time, highly responsive, and increasingly mobile customer service to keep negative experiences from going viral. Maende clearly understands this dynamic: \"I knew once I had trust online, the business would be good to go. Thanks to the support I got from family, friends, colleagues, and customers who keep on spreading the gospel of my store, I managed to pull it off.\"</p><p>The social storefront can also be used to provide business development services to young Kenyan entrepreneurs. Through social media, young women and men can grow their professional networks by becoming \"friends of friends of friends\" or by following a role model or leader in their field of interest. These professional networks become forums for peer-to-peer learning, knowledge exchange, and problem solving as young women and men throughout Kenya connect online with each other and other young entrepreneurs beyond their borders. Highly localised and context-specific market research is facilitated through social media's open sharing of customer needs and competitors' products throughout networks, allowing entrepreneurs to monitor demands and trends by the month, week or even <a href=\"http://www.socialbakers.com/twitter/country/kenya/\" rel=\"nofollow\">day</a>.</p><p>Partnerships such as the one between Equity Bank and PayPal show that big business is taking notice of this new digital model. Mr. Efi Dahan,  PayPal's Regional Director for Africa and Israel, was present at the partnership announcement. \"This strategic partnership creates a major opportunity for young Kenyan entrepreneurs to build online businesses and accept payments from 137M active accounts the 193 countries around the world where PayPal is available. Making and collecting payments is often cited as one of the major hurdles to business in Africa, as the economies are still primarily cash-based, and this is also true for e-commerce where the most common payment method is \"cash on delivery\"\". As social storefronts help young Kenyan entrepreneurs overcome barriers to international e-commerce, young people can compete in the global marketplace, becoming self-reliant, financially independent role models for their peers around the globe and invaluable customers for global corporations. <br /><em><br />Elizabeth Holland is development and grant coordinator for Digital Opportunity Trust, <a href=\"http://www.dotrust.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dot</a>, a Canadian nonprofit working to transform young people into leaders of change as they facilitate technology, business, and entrepreneurial learning experiences to people in their own communities. </em></p><p><strong>Content on this page is produced and controlled by DAI</strong></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384355938427/kenyan-warrior-on-phone-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/dai-partner-zone/new-payment-partnership-opens-kenyas-young-entrepreneurs","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/dai-partner-zone/new-payment-partnership-opens-kenyas-young-entrepreneurs","sectionName":"DAI partner zone"},{"webTitle":"Interview with Omoyele Sowore, founder of Sahara Reporters","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-13T11:14:46Z","sectionId":"media-network/omidyar-network-partner-zone","id":"media-network/omidyar-network-partner-zone/omoyele-sowore-sahara-citizen-reporting","fields":{"body":"<p>The <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network\" title=\"\">Guardian Media Network</a> travelled to Mauritius for Omidyar Network's annual <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://onbaraza.com/\" title=\"\">ON Baraza</a>. The event gathers Omidyar Network's Africa-based and Africa-focused partner organisations to share insights around innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership.</p><p>Omoyele Sowore spoke to us about the role of citizen reporting in Africa and why ON Baraza is so important for organisations like his.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about Sahara Reporters? What were your reasons for founding the company?</strong></p><p>I founded Sahara Reporters in 2005, but we didn't start publishing content until 2006. It was my response to try and reclaim the media space from the mainstream media. I was inspired at that time by IMC, what is now known as Indy Media in the US, and how citizens were reporting on the protest in Seattle against the WTO (World Trade Organisation), which was largely ignored by the mainstream media.</p><p>To find that citizens can actually report events as they are happening in real-time, and the potential role that technology could play here, really inspired me. So I decided to take it to the next level by asking people out of Nigeria to report, particularly around corruption. And it turns out that one of the things that were reported a lot about was the acquisition of property by Nigerian officials outside of Nigeria. Through this work, I became very familiar with the UK land registry and spent some money buying documentation from this service.</p><p>I also moved to the US and found a number of properties that were openly owned by Nigerian officials who were in public office, which was against the law at that time. We moved from publishing documents to asking citizens in the UK and US to go to these houses and take photographs, which we then made available to the public. This ignited a lot of interest. Some of our major breakthroughs involved taking what was already available in the public domain and using this information to write corruption stories in a way that people can understand.</p><p>The moment this happened, citizens began to take ownership of this process by making sure they provided us with more information. Later, we used social media platforms to promote our stories. This had a significant impact on how people accepted and received our news. All of this process was driven by citizens and continues to be so.</p><p>We have grown from just myself buying a laptop for $600 on eBay, to an organisation that has now become a full multi-media platform; we now have a website, a TV channel called Sahara TV and a radio channel Sahara FM radio. These different elements have helped to make us one of the most popular platforms in Nigeria today.</p><p><strong>You receive over 8m views per month on your site. What factors do you think have contributed to your success?</strong></p><p>I think it is largely the fact that we have been very fast on our feet. Our integrity is another important factor. We came into a media space that had become polluted and compromised, but our reporting is evidence based. We provide raw evidence so that people can understand that we are not just saying that these things are actually happening. Whenever the evidence does not compromise or threaten our source, we will provide the evidence. There have been times when we have published credit card numbers and bank account numbers. We have made this information accessible to all. And now local media, which initially didn't accept us, because they said we are not professional, have started to run with our stories.</p><p><strong>What is the value to your organisation of the ON Baraza?</strong></p><p>For me, this is mostly a place to network and interact with others. In some ways, it also a place of infection, where you can hear stories that motivate you to do more. You get to meet people that you never thought could be of help to you, but in fact are able to.</p><p><strong>What's next for Sahara reporters?</strong></p><p>One of the things we want to do is to have more of a presence in other parts of Africa. Currently, we are heavily invested in Nigeria. The plan four years ago was to leave Nigeria, but the demand for our reporting here has kept growing. Not only are there 160m Nigerians inside Nigeria, there are between 6 to 10m Nigerians outside of Nigeria who are rabid consumers of news. So the demand from these people, coupled with demands from Nigerians at home, from international media, from policymakers, and business people (even though they hate us sometimes), means that we couldn't just leave Nigeria for say Kenya. But I would love to be in places like Kenya, Ghana, Senegal, South Africa, or to have some sort of collaboration where we can ignite the kind of media change that our style of reporting has brought to Nigeria. We want to empower other African nations with an alternative way to access accurate reporting.</p><p><em>Omoyele Sowore is the founder of </em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://saharareporters.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Sahara reporters</em></a></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/13/1384341086309/Omoyele-Sowore-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/omidyar-network-partner-zone/omoyele-sowore-sahara-citizen-reporting","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media-network/omidyar-network-partner-zone/omoyele-sowore-sahara-citizen-reporting","sectionName":"Omidyar partner zone"},{"webTitle":"James Tooley: A champion of low-cost schools or a dangerous man?","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-12T08:00:01Z","sectionId":"education","id":"education/2013/nov/12/professor-james-tooley-low-cost-schools","fields":{"body":"<p>In January 2000, James Tooley, then working as a consultant for an arm of the World Bank, left his five-star hotel in Hyderabad, India, to see the Charminar, described in the guidebooks as the city's \"must see\" attraction. As his autorickshaw proceeded through middle-class suburbs, he was struck by the ubiquity of private schools. But the Charminar, a triumphal arch built in 1591, stands at the heart of the old city slums. And, to Tooley's surprise, the private schools didn't thin out as he passed through poorer areas. When he continued his journey on foot, deeper into the slums, \"there seemed to be a private school on every street corner\".</p><p>These were not, with a few exceptions, philanthropic concerns run by charities. They were private, profit-making enterprises, run by local entrepreneurs and charging rock-bottom fees to poor parents. Nor, it turned out, were they confined to Hyderabad. As Tooley went elsewhere in Africa and Asia – to Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, even China – he found similar schools. He ventured down stinking alleyways, stepped through open sewers, tramped to remote villages. Poor parents, exasperated by the failings or even non-existence of state education, had exerted \"people power\" and achieved what Tooley calls \"grassroots privatisation\".</p><p>In nearly every case, he discovered, these schools, though they relied largely on unqualified teachers receiving minimal salaries, outperformed the state schools. Most remarkably, state education officials and aid agencies denied their very existence. Yet many schools had started at least a decade earlier and, in India, similar schools existed 200 years ago, only to be wiped out by British colonialists.</p><p>In and around Madras in the 1820s, according to documents Tooley found in London archives, a \"deep-rooted and extensive\" education system covered 25% of the male school-age population, a level then comparable to most European countries. Around Bombay, \"hardly a village, great or small\" lacked a school. Even more amazingly, Indian schools used an \"economical\" teaching method whereby older pupils taught younger ones. This method was supposedly invented in Britain by Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster. But as Tooley tells it, they plagiarised it from India.</p><p>Tooley, now professor of education at Newcastle University, tells the story in his book The Beautiful Tree – the title is from Mahatma Gandhi's metaphor for indigenous Indian schooling, which he accused the British of uprooting – first published in 2009 and just out in paperback. It is written with verve, humour and suspense. When I met Tooley in Newcastle, I said his views echoed those of the de-schooler Ivan Illich, whose work excited the western left in the 1970s. In a lecture in 2005, Tooley said that \"as the market develops … education will become organically linked again into … family homes, workplaces, sports centres, town halls, reading rooms in pubs, debating chambers, book stores … but you won't see the youth ghettos we call schools and colleges\".</p><p>Tooley told me Illich had indeed been an influence. At a Bristol comprehensive in the 1970s, from which he eventually dropped out without completing his A-levels, he was taught by \"a radical de-schooler who started a folk club where I wrote anti-school songs\". Though his parents were Conservatives, he was a lefty as a young man and once joined the Labour party. After eventually taking his A-levels privately and then a maths degree at Sussex University, he travelled to Zimbabwe to teach and to assist, of all people, Robert Mugabe, in building socialism.</p><p>Tooley, 54, is charming, jolly and generous, and nobody who knows him doubts his sincerity and his genuine enthusiasm for what are, rather ambiguously, called \"low-cost private schools\". Nor would anyone now seriously dispute the existence of such schools or even their frequent superiority to neighbouring state schools, though the scale of the superiority is disputed.</p><p>But some would say that as far as state education is concerned, Tooley is a dangerous character. He has been described as \"the high priest of privatised education in Britain\" and, by Stephen Ball, a professor at London University's Institute of Education, as \"a policy entrepreneur par excellence\". The Beautiful Tree misleads the reader – Tooley insists this was unintentional and blames the editors – into thinking that, in 2000, he was still a socialist by conviction who had somehow drifted into working for the World Bank and was converted in Hyderabad to the glories of private education. In fact, he was already a leading advocate of privatisation who founded the education unit at the rightwing Institute of Economic Affairs in the mid-1990s.</p><p>Though he described the Hyderabad visit as \"my epiphany, when the bits of my life came together\", the Damascene moment, he said, occurred much earlier at the Institute of Education in London when, during PhD studies, he read EG West's Education and the State, a sacred text for free marketeers. It argued that, long before the 1870 Education Act established compulsory state education, the majority of English children were literate, thanks to private and voluntary schools. Tooley found private schools in Hyderabad because he wanted to find them, having accepted the West thesis that, in the early 19th century, they were doing a brilliant job in England and would do so again if the state stepped aside.</p><p>Now he has become an investor in private schools, remortgaging his house and sinking his savings into schools for the poor in the developing world. He initially linked with Orient Global, founded by the New Zealand-born billionaire Richard Chandler who specialises in investing in developing economies, to work in China and India. He soon broke with Chandler, but refuses to talk about the details – except to say, in future, he will be more wary of men with Boeing 737s – and concentrated on building Omega Schools with a local partner in Ghana. The company opened its first schools in 2009, and now has 40, with 20,000 pupils. Tooley predicts 100 schools with 50,000 pupils next year.</p><p>Last year, Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and the world's biggest educational publisher, took a stake in the company, allowing it to expand throughout Ghana. Pearson's chief education adviser is Sir Michael Barber, formerly a top aide to Tony Blair and an old friend of Tooley's from when both men were teaching and building socialism in Zimbabwe.</p><p>Tooley is cagey about the business model, but says he hasn't taken any money out of the company and doesn't draw a salary. Nevertheless, he is \"relaxed\" about his partner becoming rich and thinks Pearson \"is excited by this market\". He insists that the daily fee, the equivalent of about 40p per child, is not only affordable to poor parents but no dearer than state schools. \"It covers everything, including lunch, two uniforms, workbooks and a bag. The state schools charge for extras, so many parents see the costs as identical.\" They choose his school because it is better value, with the average pupil's reading (according to Tooley) well ahead of his or her peers in government schools.</p><p>\"They see teachers arriving at the government school at 11am and leaving at 12. They see them sitting outside and not actually teaching while the children are sent on errands. In a private school, there's an owner and, if the teachers don't turn up, they'll be fired.\" As in the private schools he discovered, Tooley's teachers are largely unqualified and on low wages. \"They are typically high school graduates. Some are saving up to go to university or doing it for idealistic reasons as I was in Zimbabwe. We create everything they need centrally – lesson plans, workbooks, exercises – and give them a three-week crash course.\"</p><p>Tooley believes this bargain-basement education offers the best hope for the future of the developing world. Aid agencies, he says, should switch funds to supporting such schools rather than subsidising state systems which, despite the billions poured into them, still fail.</p><p>These views are bitterly contested. Education, critics argue, should be a right, not a commodity for which parents pay. The biggest educational gains in Africa and Asia followed the spread of free public education; the future lies in spreading it further and making it better, not in propping up a private sector that can never guarantee universal coverage, equity or consistent standards and usually excludes those in the most extreme poverty. \"Every dollar households spend on school fees,\" says Prof Keith Lewin of Sussex University's centre for international education, \"is a dollar less to spend on health, clean water, food and shelter. So fee-paying private schools increase poverty directly.\"</p><p>An exhaustive study of the evidence, recently completed by Claire Mcloughlin, a senior research fellow in international development at Birmingham University, reports that, while rigorous studies such as Tooley's find privately educated pupils doing better than peers in government schools, even after socio-economic background is taken into account, \"other [albeit fewer] studies find the opposite\". The findings, Mcloughlin says, \"are inconclusive\".</p><p>Nevertheless, private school chains are spreading across the world. Pearson has also invested in Kenya's Bridge chain, which opens 2.5 schools a day and now has more branches than any other Kenyan business.</p><p>Tooley believes that countries such as Britain should learn from India, Ghana, Kenya and others. We, too, could have low-cost private schools if they were run commercially, as established schools such as Eton and Harrow are not. With bigger classes, more modest buildings, less experienced teachers and more technology, they could charge less than £2,000 a year per pupil.</p><p>\"I don't support Michael Gove's free schools or US charter schools,\" he says. \"I'm a purist. The government shouldn't privatise education because it will make a mess of it, as it did with the railways. I want to see private schools emerge and then the state just move aside from education.\"</p><p>He is unfazed when you suggest that, in a schools market, as in energy, banking, retail and a host of other markets, we would end up with a handful of big chains, some controlled by hedge funds or foreign conglomerates, spending more on sales, marketing and shareholders' dividends than on teaching children, and restricting choice rather than widening it. He says that school chains with names such as EasyLearn or Virgin Opportunity could, to parents, carry similar guarantees of quality and reliability as those of Sainsbury's or Boots. But he also says there should be and will be room (without quite explaining how) for more local school enterprises.</p><p>Fanciful ideas? Perhaps, until you think how rapidly they are spreading across the developing world and how private capital is making inroads to higher education both here and in the US.

The event gathers Omidyar Network's Africa-based and Africa-focused partner organisations to share insights around innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership.</p><p>Shannon May spoke to us about the inspiration for Bridge International Academies and the role of technology in helping to democratise education.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about Bridge International Academies?</strong></p><p>Bridge International Academies is the world's largest private provider of nursery and primary education for families living on $2 a day or less. Our current operations are in Kenya. We currently have 214 academies that offer both nursery and primary school within the same facility. We serve 60,000 children, six days a week. We teach Monday through Saturday. We estimate that by March 2014, we will be serving around 100,000 children.</p><p><strong>What were your reasons for founding Bridge International Academies? Where did the idea come from?</strong></p><p>The original idea actually occurred in China when I was working on my PhD on development. I was working on an eco-system project to totally re-organise this group of nine villages into a carbon neutral eco-city. I was there for 18 months. But as part of the government plan to allow me to do my work, unbeknown to me, I had become the village's primary school teacher for the entire time I was there. So I had to teach English to all of the children every day. So while I was working on this environment sustainability city plan and doing all sorts of analysis on the household economies of those living in the village, I was also teaching children.</p><p>It soon become clear that no matter what the programme was going to do, whether it was successful or not, it really wouldn't matter for the people that lived there. Because the real fundamental problem, was that 90% of the population was functionally illiterate and they didn't have basic algebra skills.</p><p>Through my interviews, I discovered that very few of the families understood if they were making or losing money. They didn't possess the skills to do that sort of time-sensitive accounting over a long period of time. It wasn't that they were less intelligent; it was because they were poorly educated. And every morning I would see that in the village school where the teachers didn't show up, came unprepared or drunk. There was a total lack of accountability around what a teacher is meant to do.</p><p>Jay (the other co-founder) and I started to explore if this was just a rural China problem or a China problem, but unfortunately, we discovered that it's a global problem, mostly in developing countries where you have radical failure of existing service providers to deliver a quality basic education. Particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa you find abysmal education performance rates. Even in Kenya, only around 50% of children pass the end of class 8 examination. So about half the country is failing this test every year. Children are in school but they are not learning. This is the problem that Bridge was started to solve. We want to democratise education and knowledge, so that it's not just children from middle-class or wealthy families that have access to exceptional education.</p><p><strong>On your website, you talk about an 'academy-in-a-box model'. What do you mean by this?</strong></p><p>The reason it is called an 'academy-in-a-box' is because all of our academies are the same. All of the systems across the schools are the same. This is how we are able to ensure that every child receives the same high-quality teaching irrespective of the academy's location. To run hundreds of schools requires a tremendous amount of systematisation and standardisation. This is part of the science of what we do. We create the systems that enable each one of the current 214 academies to operate like the others. We leverage a tremendous amount of technology to ensure that the academies are run in an incredibly cost-effective and lean way. One of our investors actually lists us as a technology enabled service company.</p><p>We only have one non-teaching staff at our academies and this is how we keep our costs down. We don't have secretaries, assistants, bursars of treasurers. Everything that another school, whether high cost or low cost, would need to do to support 600 or 100 students we can do with one person as we have put all of those other functions into custom developed software that is run on an android device. So everything from billing history and payment history is managed and accessible from the phone. Payments for all pre-approved vendors and the process fro pre-approving vendors, is all done through another software app that we have developed. All our payments are cashless. So there is no treasurer at the school. Everything gets paid in through mobile money or direct bank transfers – everything gets paid out the same way. All summaries for teacher audits and record keeping are also put into the smartphone. This helps make schools more transparent.</p><p><strong>Finally, what is next for Bridge International Academies?</strong></p><p>We will keep growing in Kenya. We will open another 150 academies in 2014. We will between double and triple the amount of children we are serving. Similarly, we will double or triple our workforce so we will have a little more than 3000 staff employed in Kenya by the end of this year and between 4000-5000 by 2014. In 2014, we will also be expanding across the African continent, and move into our second and third countries. We are currently hiring for key people to join us on that adventure.</p><p><em>Dr. Shannon May is the co-founder of </em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bridgeinternationalacademies.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Bridge International Academies</em></a><em> </em></p>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/11/1384185291563/Shannon-May-003.jpg"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/omidyar-network-partner-zone/democratising-education-shannon-may-bridge","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media-network/omidyar-network-partner-zone/democratising-education-shannon-may-bridge","sectionName":"Omidyar partner zone"},{"webTitle":"From Bosnia to Syria: the investigators identifying victims of genocide","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-10T18:30:00Z","sectionId":"law","id":"law/2013/nov/10/bosnia-syria-victims-of-genocide-dna","fields":{"body":"<p>The dead body of the man in the blue T-shirt is covered in blood, and has been dumped in a line with tens of others in the courtyard of a building in Syria. In the colour photograph, the sun is shining down on the corpses, all of whom bear the marks of violence, some showing multiple bullet wounds.</p><p>Dr Radwan Ziadeh, the director of the Damascus Centre for Human Rights Studies, clicks on to the next slide in his presentation. It shows a trench filled with the dead bodies of those killed in a massacre in Syria in 2012, the corpses lying jumbled, packed tightly on top of one another.</p><p>\"That man in the blue T-shirt,\" says Ziadeh, looking at his audience, \"is my cousin.\" He pauses, looking at the assembled Kurds, Iraqis, Libyans, Bosnians, Serbs, Mexicans, Americans and others in front of him, gathered in the airy auditorium of the Peace Palace in The&nbsp;Hague.</p><p>\"I never thought,\" says Ziadeh, a&nbsp;soft-spoken man with a neat moustache and black hair, \"that I would see mass graves in my country.\"</p><p>Many in the audience nod firmly in agreement, for, like the activist, who has been documenting human rights abuses in Syria since 2011, they have mass graves in their countries too. They have gathered here in the Netherlands to try to establish a workable method of co-ordinating the multiple, highly complex facets of dealing with the rarified and painful world that is missing persons.</p><p>\"Before I finish, I want to raise the&nbsp;issue of 'never again',\" continues Ziadeh, clicking off his PowerPoint, and handing over the podium to the next speaker. This is a quietly determined American woman who knows all too well that those words, uttered at the Nazi war crimes trials in Nuremberg more than 60 years ago, have proved somewhat hollow. With an estimated 48,000 people, mostly civilians, missing in Syria alone – victims of forced disappearances, massacres and executions – the map of world conflict nowadays would instead seem to shout \"again and again\".</p><p>The organisation that Kathryne Bomberger heads – the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) – has perhaps done more than&nbsp;any to account for many of the thousands of people missing worldwide from wars, ethnic cleansing and natural disasters. The officials gathered in front of her from multiple conflict areas bear testament to this.</p><p>Croatian president Ivo Josipovic, whose country has uncovered about 150 mass graves from the war in the 1990s, said in the auditorium: \"The issue of missing persons remains at the heart of every armed conflict.\"</p><p>\"Syria,\" says Bomberger, \"is a looming challenge. The challenge to carry out the non-discriminatory search for the missing is the challenge of the former Yugoslavia, is the challenge of Syria, the challenge of Libya, and the challenge of Iraq.\"</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-412644715\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/7/11/130711srebrenica-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/7/11/130711srebrenica/130711srebrenica.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/7/11/130711srebrenica-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/7/11/130711srebrenica_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/7/11/130711srebrenica_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>She should know. When, in 1999, the ICMP set out to find and identify the estimated 8,100 Bosnian Muslim men and boys who had gone missing following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2011/jul/12/bosnia-srebrenica-victims-buried\" title=\"\">the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in eastern Bosnia</a>, many people said it could never be done. After all, the bodies of the men killed by the Bosnian Serb forces of General Ratko Mladic – now on trial for genocide in a Hague courtroom, a mile from the ICMP conference – had been buried in dozens of mass graves hidden in the wild Bosnian countryside. One forensic scientist said that finding the victims and giving them back their identities would be akin to&nbsp;\"solving the world's greatest forensic puzzle\".</p><p>Undaunted, Bomberger and the ICMP picked up the gauntlet, and 18&nbsp;years later, using advanced DNA-identification techniques at their Sarajevo laboratory, have identified nearly 7,000 of the Srebrenica dead, along with another 10,000 people missing from the Balkans conflicts of the 90s. The small organisation, only about 175 strong, is made up of forensic scientists, geneticists, biologists, human rights experts and support staff. A high percentage are from the former Yugoslavia, tenacious and resourceful people recruited in Bosnia after the war.</p><p>ICMP has now spread its operational wings: it is helping to identify the missing of Iraq and Libya, and has&nbsp;identified Chilean victims of General Pinochet from the 1970s, hundreds of&nbsp;cases from natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in&nbsp;2005 and the Asian tsunami in December 2004, and&nbsp;even soldiers from the second world war.</p><p>When former British foreign secretary David Miliband, visiting their Bosnian headquarters in 2009, branded them a \"global centre of excellence\", he was not being overgenerous. Danish professor Niels Morling, vice-president of the International Society for Forensic Genetics, gets straight to the point: \"The work of the ICMP is almost incredible – its work with DNA is, without doubt, the single most important achievement within the field of human identification with DNA.\"</p><p>So is it time to use this expertise to help Syria? And how? For now it is too early to say, as setting up a workable programme to handle missing persons – which means, to start with, finding and exhuming the dead – is obviously impossible while civil war is cracking across the country. And ICMP, as it says in its mandate, \"provides assistance to governments\", so some sort of post-conflict administration would have to be in place in Syria to request help in dealing with the thorny issue of missing persons.</p><p>But suffice to say that ICMP has already received a delegation of interested parties at its Sarajevo headquarters, which included Ziadeh.</p><p>So how on Earth, if asked, would it go looking for 48,000 missing people in a place such as Syria? What forensic science and human rights tools would it need, what judicial and legal permissions? How, in short, would it all work? And why is it so important to deal with the problem of missing people?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422807401'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/8/1383939326440/A-mass-grave-in-Serbia-003.jpg' alt='A mass grave in Serbia' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A worker from the International Commission on Missing Persons at the site of a mass grave in Serbia. Photograph: Jasmin  Agovic</figcaption></figure><p>How it might operate forensically in Syria is reflected by how it is working this week, several hundred miles south of The Hague, in the chilly autumn of north-western Bosnia. In an enormous clay pit set in scrubby woodland outside the hamlet of Tomasica, British, American and Bosnian forensic experts from the ICMP, along with counterparts from Bosnia's Missing Persons Institute, are digging up hundreds of muddy, grey-brown corpses. These are Bosnians executed 20 years ago, painstakingly exhumed from one of the largest mass graves ever found in the country. So far, 247 complete bodies have been recovered.</p><p>It is a mammoth feat of engineering and forensics, to start with: the corpses, alleged to be victims of ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serb forces in and around the nearby town of Prijedor in 1992, are buried about 7.5 metres (25&nbsp;feet) under the surface. In an area larger than a football pitch, 40,000 cubic metres of gluey, hard-packed clay has had to be removed with diggers in order to access the bodies. They lie underneath it in jumbled panoplies of death, teeth exposed, mouths open, skin still attached in greying shrouds to their skeletons, for ever frozen in their moment of mortal truth.</p><p>The decomposition of human bodies is slowed by a lack of oxidisation, and the clay in the grave has effectively sealed the bodies from the outside air. The process of saponification, whereby after death the body's tissue turns to a soap-like substance called adipocere, also called grave-wax, has been slowed. Muscular and organ tissue still clings to the skeletons.</p><p>Once exhumed, the bodies are taken to a nearby makeshift mortuary, to <sup></sup>begin the road through ICMP's DNA laboratory system. Hopefully, for the living relatives of the Tomasica dead, who have waited 20 agonising years to find them, this will see the remains identified and returned to their families for proper burial. The legal, forensic and human rights apparatus that makes this possible – the pathologists, mortuaries, autopsies, associations of&nbsp;living family members, DNA labs, data-matching software, court orders – is a vast operational monolith whose running the ICMP has perfected in Bosnia since the war. Wherever it goes, it must operate within the framework of any given country's laws.</p><p>\"Science cannot exist in a vacuum,\" says an ICMP director. \"It has to coincide with a rule-of-law approach.\"</p><p>In The Hague, Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans called for the ICMP to be given legal status under international law to enable it to operate worldwide – a motion supported by the UK, whose successive governments have been among the 22 worldwide that have funded the organisation over the past 17 years.</p><p>Regardless of whether the victims in question are from Kosovo or Iraq or Libya – or, as at Tomasica, from Bosnia – the identification of missing people is&nbsp;desperately important for human rights, reconciliation and justice. It establishes accurate numbers of casualties, and they prove what happened. On history's card table, they&nbsp;lay down a scientifically precise ace of spades. They put in place an absolutist cornerstone of the process of rule-of-law, as establishing numbers of&nbsp;missing persons is also vital for any war crimes trials.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422807402'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/8/1383939651320/After-Hurricane-Katrina-001.jpg' alt='After Hurricane Katrina' width='460' height='275' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>DNA was used to identify victims of natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>It helps with natural disasters and terrorist incidents too – ICMP staff are currently in Nairobi, assisting with the aftermath of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/kenya-charges-four-somali-men-westgate-mall-attack\" title=\"\">Westgate shopping mall attack</a>. Last summer, when a train caught fire off <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/12/lac-megantic-train-crash-bodies\" title=\"\">Lac-Mégantic in Canada</a>, killing 50 people, the heavily burned remains of some of the victims arrived in the Sarajevo DNA laboratory.</p><p>ICMP's work is also, with the consent of relatives of the victims, used as evidence in war crimes trials, such as those of senior Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadžic and Ratko Mladic, being tried by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), also based in The Hague. This provision of evidence can thus contribute to a newly emerging form of&nbsp;\"atrocity accountability\". It issues a&nbsp;warning to warlords the&nbsp;world over&nbsp;that their crimes can, one day, come back to haunt them in international courts.</p><p>But first the remains of missing persons have to be identified. Since the 1970s, thousands of people have gone missing from conflicts in countries including Chile, El Salvador and Iraq, as well as the Balkans. Before the ICMP started using DNA testing in 2000, human remains were mostly identified through artefacts found with them: dentures, blood-stained clothing, documents and&nbsp;fingerprints – the stark, mundane memorabilia of violent human demise. The problem was that this method was&nbsp;unreliable.</p><p>Two years after the 1995 Dayton Accords ended the Bosnian war, President Bill Clinton introduced an initiative to found the ICMP. In the dry,&nbsp;formal language of mandate and policy, its job was to provide a proper accounting of the persons missing from the conflicts in Bosnia and Croatia. It then proceeded to revolutionise the process of making large numbers of DNA matches on missing persons' remains. Using blood samples taken from the living relatives of victims, it matched them with the DNA taken from skeletal remains exhumed from mass graves, such as those from Srebrenica. Bomberger says: \"In the early days, while mankind had been able to map the human genome, the ICMP was using DNA technology to map a human genocide.\"</p><p>So how does this identification process work, and what makes the ICMP's laboratory system unique? The answer lies partly in the vast numbers of human remains it handles – 40,000 people were missing in the former Yugoslavia alone – which no other commercial or government laboratory could even approach.</p><p>Second, it has developed its own matching software and vast databases containing genetic information from nearly 100,000 people, both living and dead. From this, it developed a system that could cross-reference vast numbers of DNA samples, taken from blood given by living relatives, and that extracted from remains exhumed from graves. By November 2008, for instance, ICMP would have collected more than 86,650 blood samples from living Balkans' relatives alone. The more blood samples that were collected, the easier it proved to cross-match DNA samples taken from the bones of exhumed victims.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-422807403'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/8/1383939724971/Bones-for-DNA-analysis--001.jpg' alt='Bones for DNA analysis ' width='460' height='275' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Bones are cut for DNA analysis. Photograph: Jasmin Agovic</figcaption></figure><p>Third, the ICMP's laboratory system excels at extracting tiny amounts of DNA from heavily \"degraded\" bone samples. The DNA molecules that are&nbsp;best protected in bone are in the&nbsp;osteocytes – a type of cell – of mineralised cortical portions of hard bone, such as femurs. These are the hardest substances in the human anatomy and the ones that best resist the degradation of time and burial.</p><p>It was thus much harder for the ICMP to extract DNA from the human remains of Norwegian soldiers who had been killed on the eastern front north of Leningrad in the second world war than it was to extract DNA from Hurricane Katrina victims from 2005. The Norwegian soldiers had lain where they fell, on the surface of the Arctic tundra, for more than 60 years since 1944, frozen in winter, defrosted in summer, heavily oxidised, with interim interference from animals such as arctic foxes. The Katrina samples were fresh.</p><p>ICMP's central DNA laboratory is set in a quiet part of northern Sarajevo. The identification process for DNA profiling, or \"fingerprinting\", starts with blood and bone samples. Human remains, once they are exhumed from sites such as Tomasica, are washed, autopsied and catalogued. Bone samples, each about 10-15cm (4-6in) long, are cut with electric saws from the long bones, such as the femurs, of the victims.</p><p>Electric grinders are then used to scour dirt from the surface of the bone samples, which tend to absorb colouring and stains from the surrounding earth and from the clothing covering the corpse. When the ICMP was exhuming Bosnian mass graves in the years after the war, some of the clothing that sometimes appeared best-preserved was that made by Levi Strauss. A common contaminant that can impede the DNA extraction process is humic acid, a constituent part of many soil types.</p><p>Then, ground down into very fine powder, the bone samples are washed, and in a chemical solution, \"lysis\" takes place. This is the process of breaking down a cell so its constituent parts can be isolated for examination. The resultant liquid sample is then purified to remove any traces of detergents or reagents, spun in centrifuges and treated in devices equipped with silica membranes to which, simply put, the microscopic DNA particles adhere.</p><p>The DNA profile of a person is made by the ICMP using the Nuclear Short Tandem Repeat (STR) method. The main building blocks of the DNA molecule are four nitrogen-containing compounds called nucleobases – adenine, guanine, thymine and cytosine. The DNA double helix is normally made up of two DNA molecules, whose component parts intertwine like the branches of a weaving vine.</p><p>These four nucleobases repeat all along the DNA strand, pairing off and building \"base pairs\" of adenine with thymine, cytosine with guanine. The patterns in which they repeat and occur on the DNA strand are different in each human being, and form the basis of STRs. If the DNA strand can be&nbsp;amplified millions of times, the patterns of these repeats can be identified, and a profile of them obtained. This is the human DNA profile or \"fingerprint\".</p><p>Yet the scientific successes of the ICMP could never have been realised without the residual human sadness of&nbsp;thousands of relatives of missing people. Kada Hotic is one of these. A Bosnian Muslim woman, she lost her husband, son, two brothers and an uncle at Srebrenica in 1995. Over the subsequent 18 years, as the vice-president of the Association of Mothers of Srebrenica, she has followed ICMP's development, and its exhumation of the dozens of Srebrenica mass graves. These have led to her being reunited with the correctly identified remains of&nbsp;her five male relatives. She sums it up simply: \"ICMP has done great things: it gave us back the ones we&nbsp;love.\"</p><p>One exceptional part played in the aftermath of the Balkan wars by the ICMP was to introduce measures to ensure justice. This approach, stresses Adam Boys, the organisation's chief operating officer, a former chartered accountant from Argyll, is about the rule of law. \"You simply cannot kill tens, hundreds or thousands of people and expect to get away with it,\" he says. \"I strongly believe that this message will be increasingly reinforced so that military leaders or their governments will consider hard before they commit crimes: ICMP's legacy and&nbsp;the legacies of similar institutions that support the rule of law could be a&nbsp;diminution in the number and scale of atrocities.\"</p><p>Warlords have been warned.</p><p><em>• Bosnia's Million Bones: Solving the World's Greatest Forensic Puzzle by Christian Jennings, published by Palgrave MacMillan in the UK and the USA, is out on 26 November, price £16.99 ($28.00).
