Udadisi
===============
As part of [SmartDataHack 2015](http://smartdatahack.org/2015/#udadisi), Olaf, [Judy](https://github.com/maeyoko), [Mateusz](https://github.com/eramateusz) and Katie Hartin formed a team to respond to [Practical Action's](http://practicalaction.org/) Challenge: how can data from social media and news media sources build a picture of innovation in and around Nairobi, Kenya?

Udadisi, meaning "curiosity" in the Swahili language, is a trend detection and exploration platform. Our goal was to visualize a history of news data in a way that is informative and tells a story about various types of emerging technology in this dynamic and vibrant city.
